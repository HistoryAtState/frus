                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State <persName>Frank B. Kellogg</persName> on March 26, 1925.
                    These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President <persName>George Bush</persName> on
                    October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the
                    Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government,
                    including facts that contributed to the formulation of policies and records that
                    provided supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of
                    concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30
                    years after the events recorded.</p>

                <p>The editors of this volume, which was compiled in 1991, are convinced that it
                    meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and
                    editing. Although this volume records policies and events of more than 30 years
                    ago, the statute of October 28, 1991, allows the Department until 1996 to reach
                    the 30-year line in the publication of the series.</p>

                <p>The statute of October 28, 1991, requires that the published record in the <hi

                    provide comprehensive documentation on all the major foreign policy decisions
                    and actions of the U.S. Government. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government cooperate with
                    the Department of State Historian by providing full and complete access to
                    records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing
                    copies of selected records. The editors judge that this volume was prepared in
                    complete accordance with the stand-ards and mandates of this statute.</p>

                <p>In planning and preparing this volume and the other five documenting U.S. foreign
                    policy regarding Europe during the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                        >Kennedy</persName> administration, the editors concluded that the records
                    of the Department of State would constitute the central core of the published
                    record. In preparing this volume, Department of State historians have enjoyed
                    complete and unconditional access to all records and papers of the Department of
                    State: the central files of the Department; the special decentralized (lot)
                    files of the policymaking levels; the files of the Department of State’s
                    Executive Secretariat, which comprehend the official papers created by or
                    submitted to the Secretary of State; the files of all overseas Foreign Service
                    posts and U.S. special missions; and the official correspondence with foreign
                    governments and with other Federal agencies. Any failure to include a complete
                    Department of State record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series cannot be attributed to constraints or limitations placed upon the
                    Department historians in their access to Department records, information
                    security regulations and practices notwithstanding.</p>
                <p>The editors of this volume fully researched the papers of President <persName
                        corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> and other White House foreign policy
                    records. These Presidential papers have become a major part of the official
                    record published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.
                    Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the Presidential libraries
                    include some of the most significant foreign affairs-related documentation from
                    other Federal agencies including the National Security Council, the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
                    All of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of these
                    agencies and the cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records
                    Administration. Particular thanks are due to officials at the <persName
                        corresp="#p_KJF2">John F. Kennedy</persName> Presidential Library for their
                    assistance in preparing this volume.</p>
                <p>These Presidential files were supplemented by White House documents in Department
                    of State files. The Department of State files were particularly valuable for
                    documenting the implementation of the policy presented in this volume.</p>
                <p>The editors also had complete access to the papers of General <persName
                        corresp="#p_TMD1">Maxwell Taylor</persName> at the National Defense
                    University, which proved to be a valuable source for the formulation of policy
                    under President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>. In addition, the
                    editors reviewed the body of declassified <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                    files at the National Archives and Records Administration. Copies of individual
                    classified <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> materials were obtained from the
                    Joint Staff on a request basis.</p>
                <p>Completion of the declassification of this volume and the final steps of its
                    preparation for publication coincided with the development since <pb n="VI"
                        xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>early 1991 by the Central Intelligence Agency,
                    in cooperation with the Department of State, of access by deparment
                    historiansccess by Department historians to high-level intelligence documents
                    from among those records still in the custody of that Agency. The Department of
                    State historians have been provided selective access to particular special files
                    of the Agency. The Department has used this access, as arranged by the CIA’s
                    History Staff, in the compilation of this volume.</p>

                    formulating policy with respect to Berlin and to the German question. This

                    White House, the Department of State, and other agencies, as well as the written
                    advice to the President from these advisers. The editors have selected from

                    memoranda of conversation and records of meetings between the President and his
                    principal foreign policy advisers. They have also included internal U.S.
                    Government policy recommendations and decision papers relating to Berlin. The
                    editors also included the advice and recommendations on foreign policy issues
                    from top-level military commanders and advisers.</p>
                <p>The editors also focused on the principal aspects of the military contingency
                    planning regarding Germany and the Berlin crisis that took place among the
                    Western Allies as well as with representatives of the Soviet Union. Normal
                    command and control activities of U.S. forces were not researched.</p>
                <p>In focusing on the major lines of the development of the crisis, the editors have
                    also presented a record of the U.S. reaction and response to the major political
                    events within the Federal Republic of Germany insofar as they figured directly
                    in ongoing high-level political negotiations.</p>
                <p>Intelligence information regarding Soviet intentions with respect to Berlin and
                    Germany in general was vitally important during the Berlin crisis and is
                    reflected in the political documents selected for publication. The editors did
                    not, however, attempt to document any particular operational activities by
                    intelligence authorities in connection with the German problem or to explore the
                    scope and impact of intelligence operations.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi></p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII"
                        facs="0007"/>meetings. Incoming telegrams from U.S. Missions are placed
                    according to time of receipt in the Department of State or other receiving
                    agency, rather than the time of transmission; memoranda of conversation are
                    placed according to the time and date of the conversation, rather than the date
                    the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material
                    omitted from this print volume and from the microfiche supplement because it was
                    unrelated to the subject of the volume, however, has not been delineated. All
                    ellipses and brackets that appear in the source text are so identified by
                    footnotes.</p>
                <p>The unnumbered first footnote to each document indicates the document’s source,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. The source
                    footnote also provides the background of important documents and policies and
                    indicates if the President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every
                    effort has been made to determine if a document has been previously published,
                    and this information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements

                <p>The declassification review of this volume in 1992 and 1993 resulted in the
                    decision to withhold one percent of the documents originally selected. The

                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security and law.
                    Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic
                    and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of
                    the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific
                    documents of those governments.</p>

                            have a direct bearing on such matters as a nuclear test ban,

                            draft proposal of a modus vivendi which has my approval.<note n="3"

                                of four paragraphs (Purpose, Proposal, Advantages, and Soviet
                                Reactions) and a draft proposal with paragraphs on: 1) Berlin, 2)
                                Germany, 3) Nuclear Diffusion, and 4) Non-Aggression. (Attachment to

                                that it was “a very dangerous paper,” since it assumed that pending

                                tensions. (Ibid.)</note> I should like to add the following for your

                                <item>We anticipate that, at an appropriate stage, such a proposal

                                    obligations of both parties that I have had in mind in my
                                    various communications with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"

                                <item>While the draft proposal corresponds, in our view, to the
                                    essential interests of all concerned, and while in our view it
                                    would stand before the world as a document fair to the prestige
                                    and power of all, we should of course be glad to hear Soviet
                                    suggestions for improvement. We believe that our document points
                                    the way to a method of handling the Berlin question which
                                    recognizes the realities on all sides.</item>

                                <item>In presenting the draft proposal to <persName
                                        corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, we should initially
                                    omit the section on Germany. Since <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                        >Gromyko</persName> will almost certainly raise questions
                                    which are directly relevant to such a section, you would
                                    indicate to him that we must talk with our Allies, including
                                    Bonn, before agreeing on any language for such a paragraph with
                                    the Soviet Government. Since it is in the common interest of
                                    both Moscow and Washington that we reach some basis of stability
                                    and mutual security on such questions, <persName
                                        corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will appreciate the
                                    need for us to be able to act on the basis of agreement with the
                                    strong and independent governments with whom we are intimately
                                    associated.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item><p>You should indicate also that if the Soviet Government is
                                        interested in discussion of this kind of proposal, and if
                                        serious progress can be made with respect to agreement on
                                        such a proposal, I would regard the matter as one which
                                        might be the basis of a fruitful meeting of Heads of
                                        Government.</p>
                                    <p>While our expectation is that you may not get much
                                        questioning from <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                            >Gromyko</persName> on this document at this stage,
                                        there may easily be an immediate question about the duration
                                        of such an understanding. I believe that our answer on this
                                        point should be indefinite, but if the point is pressed, we
                                        might suggest that the Committee of Deputies might be asked
                                        to report after a given interval of time. This would give a
                                        date for new negotiations without threatening the life of
                                        the modus vivendi itself.</p></item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>If the Soviet Union should press on the matter of occupation
                                    status, I assume that we will answer in the usual fashion—that
                                    the real presence of our troops and our real access to the city
                                    cannot be negotiated away. But it is appropriate to remark that
                                    the modus vivendi is so constructed as not to require any open
                                    abandonment by the Soviet Union of its own views on this
                                    matter.</item>
                                <label>7.</label>
                                <item>The draft proposal does not go very far, mainly because we
                                    must not put on paper things which might shock our Allies if
                                    presented without prior consultation. However, you should
                                    indicate orally to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                        >Gromyko</persName> that if the Soviet Government is
                                    prepared to discuss an interim arrangement, we would expect to
                                    be able to consider a number of additional elements. One of
                                    course is a paragraph relating to Germany, <pb n="3"
                                        xml:id="pg_3" facs="0025"/>and you should indicate
                                    informally the possibilities now contained in the bracketed
                                    German paragraph of the draft proposal. In addition, we could
                                    make it clear that during the life of the modus vivendi both
                                    sides could readily lower the temperature of their “inflammatory
                                    propaganda” on Berlin and East Germany. Further, we could
                                    indicate the possibility of widening the future negotiations on
                                    non-aggression so as to examine together proposals which the two
                                    sides have made in the past. And finally, you should repeat the
                                    private assurance you have given <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                        >Gromyko</persName> in the past that if progress can be made
                                    in this direction, we believe that boundary problems can be
                                    effectively settled.</item>

                                    that time may be more effective here than any other instrument,
                                    and you should also find occasion to develop the point that if
                                    the Soviet Union should ever wish to multiply the responsiveness
                                    of the West on this point, we believe it could obtain
                                    substantial concessions by the simple expedient of replacing
                                        <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> by a more
                                    “Polish” leader; this is a statement of objective fact, and not
                                    a bargaining proposal.</item>

                                <item>I believe that the privacy of the draft proposal is of very
                                    great importance, and yet I recognize the necessity for avoiding
                                    a split in the Western alliance by apparent “back door”
                                    negotiations. Accordingly, we have agreed that you will give
                                    appropriate oral indications of our notion of an indefinite
                                    modus vivendi to Home and <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                        >Schroeder</persName>—but it seems to be quite undesirable
                                    that the document itself should be mentioned or circulated at
                                    this time. We must consider by cable or telephone, prior to your
                                    handing over a document to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                        >Gromyko</persName>, whether we should do so without
                                    specific consultation with our Allies. It is my thought that, if
                                    real progress has been made consistent with the vital interests
                                    of the West, Allied consultation would not be difficult; on the
                                    other hand, if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                                    reactions are entirely negative, we must consider whether there
                                    would be any point in transmitting to him a document which would
                                    be both futile in Moscow and irritating to our Allies.</item>

                                        theory has been that you and Ambassador <persName
                                            corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> were trying to
                                        ascertain whether a basis for negotiations existed. This
                                        formula was designed largely to accommodate the French and
                                        to provide a vehicle for their eventual participation in
                                        Four-Power negotiations. It now seems clear that nothing
                                        which is likely to emerge from discussions with the Soviets
                                        will be enough to obtain <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                            Gaulle</persName>’s agreement to have the French join
                                        with the British and us in a conference. The problem,
                                        therefore, becomes one of finding a formula so that the
                                        French cannot legally block an arrangement on Berlin rather
                                        than trying to maintain an arbitrary and partly fictitious
                                        line between exploratory talks and negotiations.</item>

                                    <item>It still seems desirable, however, that we should continue
                                        to represent the bilateral discussions at Geneva as
                                        exploratory talks to the Soviets, making clear that we are
                                        not in a position to commit our Allies but that, if a
                                        promising avenue towards a modus vivendi appeared to be
                                        opening up, we would undertake to obtain their

                                    <item>As you are aware, Soviet intentions remain unclear. While

                                            >Thompson</persName> and the Soviets have put pressure
                                        on us in the air corridors, they have not shown an
                                        unmistakable determination to push ahead with their program
                                        of a unilateral peace treaty with the <gloss

                                            >GDR</gloss> officials. This indicates a need for some
                                        caution on our part, lest by seeming over-eager we encourage
                                        the Soviets to think that harassments in the air corridors
                                        and their other pressures <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5"

                                        Presentation of a new formulation such as the suggested
                                        Modus Vivendi on Berlin must be carefully worked out to

                                    <item>Given these considerations, an initial carrot and stick
                                        approach seems appropriate, prior to presentation of the
                                        Modus Vivendi. It will probably be desirable to begin by
                                        saying something about the air corridors (this to be decided
                                        in the light of the situation on March 12 and of the
                                        possible discussion of this subject during the tripartite
                                        meeting the previous evening). You may then wish to refer to
                                        the deadlock reached in the <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"

                                            >Gromyko</persName> talks, adding that, as the President
                                        pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_AAI1"
                                            >Adzhubei</persName> in their recent discussion in
                                        Washington, both sides seem to be repeating static formulas.
                                        The President, it may be recalled, suggested to Mr.
                                            <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> that,
                                        since any final solution of the Berlin problem seemed out of
                                        the question, both sides should seek to find an
                                        accommodation which would prevent tensions from mounting.
                                        You might then wish to continue along the lines of the

                            regret that after so many meetings of our representatives and in spite
                            of our confidential communication, the negotiations on the questions
                            relating to the German peaceful settlement, do not make any progress, to
                            put it mildly. I have the impression that the American side has not got
                            rid of the preconception that under the peaceful settlement which we
                            seek somebody takes something, somebody gives—one takes an orchard and
                            gives an apple, or sells the same horse twice. To be frank, I simply do
                            not understand such an approach to the appraisal of the meaning of our
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the reason for that is that we look at things from different
                            angles, that we view the situation and the causes that have brought it
                            about in a different way and consequently we have different views on the
                            methods of eliminating the existing tension. If you could distract
                            yourself from the notions so deeply rooted overseas and look at the
                            situation in the way we see if after all we have lived through, you
                            would probably see for yourself that in a German peaceful settlement
                            nobody sells or buys anything, nobody trades unequal values.</p>
                        <p>No, from the point of view of common sense the situation here is quite
                            clear. A terrible blood-shedding war took place. The peoples of our
                            countries fought shoulder-to-shoulder against the common
                            enemy—aggressive Hitlerite Germany. By a supreme effort and at a cost of
                            countless losses we achieved the goal—defeated the enemy. By right of
                            conquerors the four Allied Powers—the USSR, the USA, Britain and
                            France—occupied temporarily, till the peace treaty is signed, the
                            territory of Germany who had unleashed World War II.</p>
                        <p>As a heritage from our predecessors we have got a delimitation of our
                            troops, which was not quite reasonable, and the division of Berlin <pb
                                n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0030"/>into four parts. I was told that
                            when at the end of the war the plans of occupation of Germany were
                            discussed at the European Advisory Commission the British proposed to
                            seat the Allied Control Council not in Berlin but in a small town at the
                            juncture of the three occupation zones. That proposal motivated by
                            practical considerations was not accepted and it was decided to seat the
                            Control Council for symbolic reasons, in the capital of defeated
                            Hitlerite Germany.</p>
                        <p>Nobody could then envisage, of course, that there would be two Germanies
                            and the people acted at the time on the basis of the requirements of
                            organization of military occupation. It may serve as a certain excuse
                            for those who adopted decisions at that time.</p>
                        <p>But history does not always develop as the statesmen foresee. In reality
                            it turned out that there exist two Germanies. Neither you, Mr.
                            President, nor I know for how long the two German states that emerged on
                            the ruins of the Reich will exist, if they ever unite. And our
                            sympathies for these states are not quite the same: you sympathize with
                            social and political system of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>,
                            and I naturally sympathize with the German Democratic Republic as a
                            socialist state.</p>
                        <p>In addition there exists West Berlin. The population of this city lives
                            under old capitalist order while around it—on the territory of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>—socialist order has been
                            established. And here we are looking for a solution—how to ensure
                            peaceful coexistence under these circumstances.</p>
                        <p>You are well aware, Mr. President, that because of the absence of
                            peaceful settlement and the continuation of occupation West Berlin has
                            for many years been causing serious and dangerous frictions between us.
                            I will not conceal that when you insist on keeping your troops in West
                            Berlin, we understand it as an expression of a desire to preserve a
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> beachhead and military base
                            against us inside the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. We entered
                            Berlin as allies but we are not allies any longer. Moreover—we are in
                            different military blocs—you are in the North Atlantic bloc, we are in
                            the Warsaw Treaty Organization—organization of socialist countries.</p>
                        <p>These two groups are antagonistic because the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> countries have formed their bloc against socialist
                            countries. To protect our interests we had to set up a defensive Warsaw
                            Treaty Organization. What was left to be done?</p>
                        <p>You note that the present situation in Germany is not satisfactory. This
                            is our point of view too. And what can we do now? Once upon a time, so
                            the story goes, two goats met head to head on a narrow bridge across an
                            abyss. They would not give the way to each other and down they fell.
                            They were stupid and stubborn animals.</p>
                        <p>But if we fail now to show sober understanding of the situation and do
                            not realize that we have to pass by each other in a friendly way and <pb
                                n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0031"/>not to collide at the place where,
                            as you yourself emphasized, our essential interests do not cross—then it
                            will be difficult to take a reasonable decision which would permit both
                            sides to live calmly.</p>
                        <p>You often call West Berlin a stumbling block and say that until recently
                            everything was allegedly all right there. When we propose to sign a
                            peace treaty and to create a free demilitarized city in West Berlin
                            granting its population guarantees of free and independent life you
                            assert that this is abnormal. It means, that situation can be considered
                            normal only when your troops are stationed in West Berlin as occupants,
                            when the state of war is preserved there, and you do not want to
                            participate in concluding a peace treaty. But could it really be
                            considered normal? This is against common sense.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union proceeds from the necessity to find such a solution
                            which would not cause damage to either side; we must solve this whole
                            problem amicably and, having solved it, not collide with each other in
                            the future. In short, it is necessary to untie knots which create
                            frictions between our states.</p>
                        <p>I do not know, Mr. President, what else you could suggest as a solution
                            of this problem. My colleagues and I could not find anything better for
                            the improvement of post-war relations other than the conclusion of a
                            German peace treaty and the normalization of the situation in West
                            Berlin on this basis. To use the language of your representatives, we do
                            not sell or buy this city as a horse. We do not want to own this horse
                            and it is not your horse after all. It belongs to none of us.</p>
                        <p>West Berlin has turned out to be a capitalist island in the midst of
                            socialist countries. So, what! Let it remain such—we do not want to
                            seize this island or to liquidate the capitalist order which exists on
                            it. Let it be fixed what has been given by history.</p>
                        <p>You write in your message that two principles must be taken as a starting
                            point: (1) to avoid any shift favorable to one side and detrimental to
                            the other, and (2) to ensure a greater degree of stability and
                            tranquility in the entire German situation. If one adds to this that it
                            is also necessary to take into consideration the real situation in
                            Germany, i.e. the existence of the two German States—then one can say
                            that these very principles form the basis of the Soviet proposals on the
                            conclusion of a German peace treaty. The peace treaty should fix the
                            situation which really exists, should not allow to upset the established
                            balance and should secure stable peace and tranquility in Europe and not
                            only in Europe.</p>
                        <p>One of the important aspects of such solution is the respect for the
                            sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic. No one demands from the
                            Western powers to do more than observe generally adopted norms of the
                            international law and international practice with regard to the <pb
                                n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0032"/><gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>. One cannot ignore the dignity and sovereign rights of
                            a state, especially if one wants to use the routes of communications
                            crossing its territory as well as its services, if a display of good
                            will is expected from it. And it is impossible to achieve a peaceful
                            solution by pushing aggressive circles of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> to still new aggravations of the situation in the
                            centre of Europe.</p>
                        <p>You write that both sides should refrain from actions which would burden
                            the proceeding negotiations. This is a right idea. Unfortunately, the
                            Western powers are still trying in everything—both in major and in minor
                            matters—to ignore and tread on the rights of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council—not
                            without the US participation, one can assume—has even adopted a special
                            decision recommending the members of this bloc to deprive the citizens
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> of the possibility to have
                            normal contacts with many countries of the world. But what if the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in response to such a defiant decision
                            forbade the citizens of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries to go and to fly to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> or
                            anywhere through its territory? The Western powers, evidently, would not
                            like it, but that would be the exercise by the German Democratic
                            Republic of its sovereign right. Why, then, do the USA and its allies
                            consider it possible to hold such a position towards the German
                            Democratic Republic?</p>
                        <p>Or, perhaps, one should regard as a contribution to the solution of the
                            questions discussed by us the endless—and let us call a spade a
                            spade—provocative visits by politicians of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> and other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries to West Berlin? I do not wish to go into polemics now and
                            therefore I will not refer to many well known facts.</p>
                        <p>You, Mr. President, in your message, and also the US Ambassador when he
                            called on the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR touched upon the
                            question of the flights of Soviet aircraft in the air routes leading to
                            West Berlin over the territory of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>. In so doing the American side tries to create an
                            impression as if the Soviet aircraft make “aggressive harassment” to the
                            flights of the aircraft of the USA, Britain and France to West Berlin. I
                            see no necessity to dwell on this question: the actual situation and our
                            position are undoubtedly well known to the US Government. This position
                            is based entirely on the corresponding international agreements and on
                            the practice of use of these air routes.</p>
                        <p>There seems to be somebody’s hand in this artificial heating up of the
                            atmosphere around the Berlin air routes. To our mind, the best thing to
                            do would be not to encourage certain hot-heads in the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, especially among the military, but
                            to cool them off so that they realize at last that no instigating
                            actions can change the situation and deprive the Soviet Union and the
                            German Democratic Republic of what they possess. Abandoning by the
                            Western powers of their attempts to violate the lawful interests of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the USSR would constitute
                            that very abstention <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0033"/>from
                            unilateral actions, creating the danger of outbreak of serious
                            incidents, which the US Government calls for.</p>
                        <p>Generally speaking, it is very difficult to find in the document handed
                            by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> on March
                            6 a desire to facilitate an agreement. There is, however, a statement in
                            it to the effect that the US stands for the achievement of a just and
                            peaceful settlement of disputed questions dividing our countries. This
                            statement is correct, but, unfortunately, it is not substantiated in the
                            negotiations in order to achieve the necessary agreement.</p>
                        <p>I would not like to leave anything unclear—one way or another we will
                            sign a German peace treaty. I have already said in Vienna and repeat it
                            now that if there is no other choice we will make use of the US example
                            and the lesson which was taught us by it in case with Japan. Some
                            hot-heads occupying official positions in the USA are threatening us
                            with various misfortunes, but I think they are more clever in their
                            doings than in their words because only suicides can now threaten with
                            war but suicides are always insane people. I, for myself, consider that
                            our counterparts with whom we conduct conversation are mentally normal
                            people and can realistically evaluate and understand what it would mean
                            to attack the Soviet Union or another country.</p>
                        <p>Some people allege that we are attacking someone, demanding a peaceful
                            German settlement. But no sane person can consider as an attack the
                            talks on the conclusion of a peace treaty. And the conclusion of a peace
                            treaty means putting an end not only to the state of war but also to the
                            state of hostility which results from an unaccomplished peaceful
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>I believe that we, the men vested with great trust and responsibility by
                            our peoples, should understand all this correctly and should oppose
                            opinions which sometimes push us to the wrong way. To say it straight:
                            let us not frighten each other with words. We have seen enough of
                            frightening. You, Mr. President, participated in the World War II, I
                            participated not only in that war. Both of us are aware what war means
                            and as the leaders of states we know what military means are now at the
                            disposal of the USSR and the USA. Let us not count by pieces who has
                            more or who has fewer modern means of mass destruction. Each of our
                            countries has already stock-piled more than enough means to inflict an
                            irreparable devastating blow.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union intends to conclude a German peace treaty. If we do not
                            find common language with you and you yourself do not want to take part
                            in the peaceful settlement then the Soviet Union and other states will
                            sign the peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>My colleagues and I have much pondered how to bring closer our positions
                            on the questions under discussion including the problem of <pb n="12"
                                xml:id="pg_12" facs="0034"/>ensuring a free access to West Berlin.
                            Your recent letter, in which certain ideas on this point are expressed,
                            strengthened my intention to share with you the considerations that we
                            have arrived at on the creation of an international organ on the access
                            to West Berlin. I hope that the ideas that I am expressing here will be
                            received with good will, without prejudice.</p>
                        <p>Specifically I have in mind the following:</p>
                        <p>We are prepared to meet halfway the desire expressed by you and to agree
                            to the creation of a special international organ on the access to West
                            Berlin for the period of time that will be defined by the agreement
                            between us. The organ that I have in mind would act as an arbiter if
                            difficulties appeared during the practical implementation of the
                            agreements on free access to and from West Berlin. It would not be
                            empowered with any administrative functions which would give it
                            authority to directly regulate traffic or set its own regulations on the
                            traffic routes connecting West Berlin with the outside world because
                            this is a prerogative of the German Democratic Republic. In brief, any
                            talk of an organ of the kind proposed by the American side at the
                            negotiations in Moscow, which would be a kind of state within state is
                            out of question. Such situation would be in basic contradiction with the
                            most elementary concepts of respect for the sovereignty of states. From
                            the remarks made by the American side you also, it seems to me, see the
                            necessity to take this aspect of the matter into consideration.</p>
                        <p>Naturally, the creation of the international organ on the access to West
                            Berlin that I have in mind is possible only under the condition that the
                            troops which are now stationed there by virtue of occupation are
                            withdrawn from West Berlin as a result of the conclusion of a peace
                            treaty. We consider that for West Berlin itself it would be calmer and
                            better if there were no foreign troops stationed there at all. However,
                            you say, you have some doubts—would not some harm be done to the
                            population of West Berlin on the part of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>. Although we have repeatedly explained that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> does not and cannot have such aims, we
                            are nevertheless ready to agree to stationing in West Berlin for some
                            period of time, let us say for 3–5 years, symbolic contingents of troops
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or neutral countries.</p>
                        <p>All this, of course, is connected with the transformation of West Berlin
                            into a free demilitarized city and with the simultaneous achievement of
                            an agreement on a final legalization and consolidation of the existing
                            German borders and also on other questions which are well known to you
                            and which you mention in your message.</p>
                        <p>Such an arrangement could then be fixed in a peace treaty with the German
                            Democratic Republic (or in an annex to it), which will be concluded by
                            the Soviet Union and a number of other states, if the Western <pb n="13"
                                xml:id="pg_13" facs="0035"/>powers have definitively decided that at
                            the present time they will not take part in a German peaceful
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>Under an agreed solution of all these problems a part of which would be
                            an agreement on the creation of an international organ on the access to
                            West Berlin, such access through the territory of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would be exercised on the basis of
                            agreements, that is with the observance of usual regulations and
                            formalities which are applied to the transit through the territory of
                            sovereign states. We know that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            is ready to assume in an appropriate form the obligations providing for
                            an unimpeded access to and from West Berlin. Should any complications or
                            frictions in the exercise of a free access to West Berlin arise, the
                            last word would be with the international organ—arbiter of which we have
                            said above.</p>
                        <p>The international organ would include, first of all, the four powers—the
                            USSR, the US, Britain and France. Thus the Soviet Union would act in
                            capacity of a guarantor of a free and uninterrupted access to West
                            Berlin to which, judging by everything, the Western powers attach
                            particular importance. As to other possible participants of the
                            international organ, this question could be solved later by the
                            agreement of the parties.</p>
                        <p>What is the advantage of a decision that I have just outlined? In a sense
                            this is an alloy of the two positions—American and Soviet. On one hand,
                            the Soviet Government, though it is not so simple for us, agrees to the
                            creation of an international organ on access. On the other hand, an
                            agreement will be reached—if the US is not ready yet to conclude a peace
                            treaty with both German states—that with the conclusion by the Soviet
                            Union and by a number of other states of a peace treaty with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> the situation in West Berlin is
                            normalized on this basis by transforming it into a free demilitarized
                            city in accordance with our mutual agreement, and other questions which
                            you know are being solved. That would be a great victory for the cause
                            of consolidating peace and easing tension.</p>
                        <p>This is a reasonable proposal and if we could reach an agreement on its
                            basis it would help us to take off the existing heat in international
                            relations. Our proposal is a concession to you. We do not want to create
                            difficulties for you, Mr. President, and your country because in your
                            country there are hot-heads; maybe there are some among your allies too.
                            These questions are correctly understood in our country and by our
                            allies. Let us leave the troops of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            or neutral countries in a free city of West Berlin for 3–5 years to
                            allow the nerves to cool down during this period of time and then the
                            whole situation will look in a quite different light.</p>

                        <p>I hope that the thoughts, expressed by me, will allow us to concentrate
                            our attention in the course of the talks on the main questions and to
                            achieve a necessary progress in the nearest future.</p>
                        <p>It was my intention to dwell upon in this message only on the German
                            peace treaty. But in the meantime I was informed about the confidential
                            conversation with your brother, <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert

                                identified.</note></p>
                        <p>He said that since we had not achieved any progress on Berlin question,
                            you, Mr. President, consider it necessary to make an effort to find the
                            areas wherein the soonest achievement of an agreement with the Soviet
                            Union is possible. And you, according to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRF1"
                                >Robert Kennedy</persName>, think that such area is the disarmament
                            problem and, first of all, the question of the nuclear test ban.</p>
                        <p>I would have understood such a position of yours, let us say, a few days
                            ago. But, how, may I ask you, should we understand it now, when you have
                            made a decision to resume nuclear weapon tests<note n="4" xml:id="d3fn4"
                                >On March 2 President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>

                            especially on the eve of the conference where we are to deal with the
                            disarmament questions. I have expressed my attitude towards your
                            decision with full frankness in my message of March 3.<note n="5"

                            What was said there may seem harsh to you, but had I given another
                            evaluation of such a step by the US Government I would have been simply
                            insincere.</p>
                        <p>Your brother expressed the thought that our Ministers should discuss at
                            Geneva the possibilities of an accommodation on the question of the
                            nuclear test ban. As you already know from my recent message we have
                            agreed that our Minister will participate in the work of 18 nation
                            conference though I do not conceal that if you start series of nuclear
                            explosions, it will certainly not increase chances for success in the
                            Committee’s work. We, you and I, must look at the course of events
                            realistically.</p>
                        <p>Your brother said that you, Mr. President, would like to have a summit
                            meeting, which could be prepared in advance by the Ministers of Foreign
                            Affairs or through diplomatic channels. I also would believe that such a
                            meeting with you would be useful if an accommodation on a number of
                            questions is reached before it by our Ministers, that is if the
                            questions are prepared for their final discussion, approval and
                            formalizing at the meeting of the Heads of State. I am always ready for
                            such a meeting in order to ensure a necessary accommodation. When I am
                            speaking about such a meeting at the highest level I believe that both
                            our peoples are equally interested in it. After all, when the fate of
                            the mankind is at stake we as statesmen, must use all the opportunities
                            to justify the great trust placed upon us. It certainly happens
                            sometimes that efforts of ministers alone are not enough and then for
                            the sake of success <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0037"/>and in the
                            interests of peace the Heads of state and government have to join the
                            effort.</p>

                            will soon arrive in Washington. I recommend him to you and I am
                            confident that he will represent the Soviet Union in your country well.
                            He enjoys the full confidence of the Soviet Government and my full
                            confidence. Whenever you need to convey something to me in a
                            confidential way he will be able to transmit this to me personally.</p>

                                >Norstad</persName> the authority he had requested. The Secretary
                            had spoken with <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> and
                            recommended that the British Government grant the authority requested by
                            General <persName corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName> also. As soon as
                            the Secretary has received the British reply Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName> will inform the Department
                            and will request that the Department approach the French with a request
                            that they grant the authority requested by General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName> also. If neither the British
                            or French or both have not granted General <persName corresp="#p_NGLC1"
                                >Norstad</persName> the requested authority by 1800 Z, March 12, the
                            Secretary believes that General <persName corresp="#p_NGLC1"
                                >Norstad</persName> should be granted authority to proceed
                            unilaterally.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary will be discussing the air corridor question with <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> this evening and if this
                            conversation affects the views expressed above he will communicate
                            immediately with the President.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary opened the conversation by reviewing briefly his talk with
                            German Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName>.<note n="1" xml:id="d6fn1">During a working
                                luncheon with <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> at the
                                Hotel Lausanne at noon, <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                    >Schroeder</persName> stated that he had no doubts about U.S.
                                intentions with regard to Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                    >Rusk</persName> outlined the U.S. appreciation of the
                                discussions with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.
                                    (<gloss target="#t_SECDELMC1">SecDel MC</gloss>/1, 6, 9, and 10;
                                ibid., Conference Files: Lot 65 D 533, CF 2074) During the
                                conversation the Germans presented the U.S. Delegation with a 3-page
                                paper on how the talks with the Soviets might be continued.
                                (Attachment to <gloss target="#t_SECDELMC1">SecDel
                                MC</gloss>/10)</note> Following this he set forth our estimate that
                            while there had been absolutely no give in the Soviet position during
                            the bilateral talks we have had with them, still there is no evidence
                            they are preparing for a showdown. However, it seems likely that they
                            consider that they are stuck with public positions. We had considered
                            whether we could develop a sort of generalized formula under which it
                            would be possible to set up a continuing negotiating forum such as
                            Deputy Foreign Ministers. <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord
                                Home</persName> wondered whether this would fill the Soviet
                            requirements since he felt that a summit conference was an immediate
                            goal of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. The Secretary
                            replied that it might even be possible to have a Summit Conference which
                            would serve to launch the continuing Deputy Foreign Ministers forum. In
                            response to a further question from <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord
                                Home</persName> as to the content of the formula, the Secretary said
                            this might provide for a continuance of existing access procedures (that
                            is, at a suitable date, not as now under harassment) to which could be
                            added items regarding non-transfer of nuclear weapons, no use of force
                            to effect boundary changes and a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact non-aggression arrangement. At least this
                            would enable us to put forward an agenda broad enough to be of some
                            interest to the Russians. This idea was based on an assumption that the
                            Russians <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0040"/>were not out really to
                            take over access and that such a formula would give them a chance to
                            draw away. If this assumption proved to be wrong then we were faced with
                            a crisis and showdown in any event. <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord
                                Home</persName> observed the Secretary’s formula did not touch on
                            the status of the city of West Berlin which seemed a prime Soviet point
                            or the question of the presence of Allied troops in Berlin. He suggested
                            that we might also be able to add something about practical dealings
                            with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. If we did not add such
                            elements <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> feared we
                            would simply face a Soviet charge this was another Western delaying
                            tactic.</p>
                        <p>Turning to Sir <persName corresp="#p_RSF1">Frank Roberts</persName>, the
                            Secretary asked his opinion as to whether the Soviets would be more
                            receptive to his formula if it were launched at a Summit meeting in May.
                            Sir <persName>Frank</persName> thought that this would enhance the
                            attractiveness of the proposal. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                                >Thompson</persName> agreed but went on to point out with reference
                            to <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName>’s remarks that our
                            position was that the matter of our staying in West Berlin was not
                            negotiable and that this would have to be made clear. The Secretary
                            resumed, saying that it might be possible to add to the formula some
                            reference to the ultimate reunification of Germany and the setting up
                            meanwhile of technical communications between the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                                >Thompson</persName> commented that two recent developments might be
                            interpreted as a good sign. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s speech to the Central Committee Plenum had
                            made clear that the conflict with the Chinese would continue.
                            Furthermore it seemed possible that the big Soviet loan to <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> might be a sort of sop to him
                            in lieu of positive action with respect to the peace treaty and status
                            of West Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName>, who
                            had been reflecting on the conversation, then agreed it would be useful
                            to try out a formula along these lines. Sir <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSCAE1">Evelyn Shuckburgh</persName> asked whether we
                            would envisage the result of this as parallel declarations or what? The
                            Secretary replied that he thought it was possible that a quadripartite
                            paper could be developed to which all four powers would adhere. However
                            he felt that there was no use to consult in any detail with the Germans
                            and French unless there was some indication of Soviet interest.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Air Corridors</hi></p>
                        <p>The Secretary then turned to the subject of the air corridors and
                            reviewed briefly the very serious Soviet maneuvers and harassments of
                            our access. He felt that the use of chaff to jam radars was particularly
                            outrageous and little short of the actual use of firearms. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> commented on the
                            surprising nature of this Soviet action contrary to their usual practice
                            of trying to cover their acts with some semblance of legality and
                            expressed the opinion that it would be important to hit Soviet Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on this promptly
                            tonight. As evidence of the seriousness with which the US regarded this
                            the Secretary <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0041"/>then pointed out to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> that if the
                            dropping of chaff in the air corridors had happened two days earlier it
                            was quite possible he would not be here today. However the news had been
                            received too late to enable him to touch base with the British and
                            others. After some further discussion of the details of the Soviet
                            actions in the air corridors and particularly the filing of flight plans
                            between the altitudes of 7500 and 10,000 feet, the Secretary suggested
                            that the time had come when we should perhaps authorize <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName> to put flights through over
                            10,000 feet. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> explained
                            that the US had already given such authority to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName> but that it was for the time
                            being contingent on British and French agreement. The Secretary then
                            gave <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> a copy of the
                            talking points prepared for his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> tonight. (Attachment) After they had been looked
                            over by the British Delegation it was agreed that these talking points
                            were very suitable for use with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> tonight except for the last sentence of numbered
                            paragraph (1). It was noted that the British could add specific
                            incidents involving British aircraft. The Secretary then suggested a
                            number of possible courses of action that might be taken as follows: <list>
                                <label>A.</label>
                                <item>In the corridors: <list>

                        <p>These were discussed at some length. It was suggested during this
                            discussion that many of these measures could be taken within <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName>’s present authority if they
                            were suggested to him by governments; also that the original British
                            condition to authorize flights over 10,000 feet, i. e. that the Soviets
                            attempt to preclude flights in the normal commercial channels of 7500 to
                            10,000 feet had now been met. While no definite decision was made on
                            these proposed countermeasures it was agreed that the Secretary would
                            serve notice on <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> before
                            the dinner tonight of his intent to bring up this serious matter and

                            been attempting to place a phone call to General <persName

                                corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName> informed the Secretary that he
                            had sent his recommendations with regard to the Soviet maneuvers which
                            should reach us within the hour and that as of tonight he needed no new

                                <item>I have observed with increasing concern the activities of
                                    Soviet aircraft in the Berlin air corridors. We had hoped that
                                    it would be possible, in the course of the next week or ten
                                    days, to have some fruitful discussions with you regarding
                                    Berlin. We cannot and will not hold such discussions, however,
                                    when the Soviet Union is carrying on a policy of deliberate
                                    harassment of Allied flights through the Berlin air
                                    corridors.</item>

                                    their rights in the Berlin air corridors. This was brought to
                                    the attention of the Soviet Government as recently as February
                                    15 following harassment of United States aircraft by Soviet
                                    fighters on February 14.</item>

                                    quadripartitely agreed flight rules under flight plans on which
                                    customary flight information had been made available to the

                                    MIG also approached to within one plane length of a Pan American
                                    World Airways aircraft loaded with passengers.</item>

                                <item>On February 19, the Soviet controller in <gloss
                                        target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss> began to file individual
                                    flight plans for Soviet military transports. Although the Soviet
                                        <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0043"/>Government has, in
                                    the past, flown occasional individual aircraft along the air
                                    corridors, this was the first time it was done on a systematic
                                    basis. The Soviet controller sought to portray these flights as
                                    “normal”, but they were a patent attempt to preempt space in the
                                    corridors by flying unnecessary flights. This intention was
                                    clearly demonstrated on March 7 when the Soviet controller filed
                                    a flight plan for a Soviet LI–2 at the same altitude and time
                                    that a scheduled Pan American World Airways plane was due in the
                                    corridor under a flight plan filed in <gloss target="#t_BASC1"
                                        >BASC</gloss>. When the United States controller asked the
                                    Soviet controller to refile his flight plan for another
                                    altitude, the Soviet controller refused. Although the Pan
                                    American plane reached Berlin safely, the Soviet flight was an
                                    obvious attempt to interfere with use by United States aircraft
                                    of the air corridors.</item>

                                <item>On March 9 on two occasions, Soviet aircraft made runs across
                                    the three air corridors some four miles West of Berlin,
                                    employing measures, including the dropping of chaff, designed to
                                    interfere with radar. This was a direct and deliberate effort to
                                    threaten the safety of flight. There can be no justification
                                    whatsoever of such practice in or near the corridors.</item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>On March 10, the Soviet controller filed flight plans for
                                    Soviet aircraft for March 12, in the South corridor at altitudes
                                    between 7,000 and 10,000 feet which are those normally used by
                                    aircraft flying to and from Berlin. The Soviet Government knows
                                    that these flights will conflict with scheduled flights by Pan
                                    American World Airways and Air France aircraft. This tactic
                                    represents a further obvious attempt to inhibit legitimate air
                                    access to Berlin provided for under the quadripartite
                                    agreements.</item>

                                <item>The Soviet Government should not overlook the fact that up to
                                    this point the Allies have shown great restraint in the face of
                                    severe provocation. The Soviet Government should understand that
                                    the Allies have the means to respond with vigor and
                                    effectiveness and that they are not prepared to tolerate
                                    persistent Soviet actions directed toward restricting exercise
                                    of their rights of air access to Berlin. We expect the Soviet
                                    Government to cease its interference in the air corridors.
                                    Allied aircraft will continue to fly in the corridors at times
                                    and altitudes deemed necessary. We will take the necessary steps
                                    to ensure the safety of such flights and will hold the Soviet
                                    Government responsible for the consequences of any incidents
                                    that might occur.</item>

                                    all states should refrain from any actions that might aggravate

                        <p>The Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName>, and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had a conversation
                            among themselves after dinner.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary raised the question of the very serious harassments by the
                            USSR during the past several weeks of air and ground access to Berlin.
                            He recalled the USSR’s attempts to reserve time in the air corridors for
                            its own flights, which attempts had been rejected by the West. He noted
                            that since then the USSR had employed other methods of harassment, such
                            as saturation of corridors contrary to past practice and to the need
                            revealed to the Western Powers, filing of flight plans in direct
                            opposition to Western flight plans, jamming of air frequencies used by
                            the West to ensure air safety and, finally, three days ago, the dropping
                            by Soviet bombers, which had come from the Soviet Union, of chaff in the
                            corridors to jam Western radar installations. He also noted that the
                            Soviets had now filed plans for flights on March 12th at altitudes from
                            7,500 to 10,000 feet at the exact times when Western civil airlines flew
                            to Berlin. The Secretary stressed that such harassments were not
                            tolerable and could lead to serious consequences. He emphasized that the
                            U.S. would take all the steps necessary to ensure safety for air access
                            to Berlin. He expressed the hope that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> would get in touch with his Government so that
                            danger may be avoided, but stressed that the US would not shrink from
                            such danger.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> pointed out that the
                            Soviet bombers which had dropped metal filings in the corridors had come
                            from a long distance. He strongly emphasized that the Soviet chaffing
                            activity was totally inappropriate since it was something that one would
                            not do to a friend but only to an enemy. If a Western plane had crashed
                            it would have been the same as if it had been shot down, and up to 100
                            lives would have been lost. He said that he had nearly turned his
                            aircraft back to London after having heard of this action by the Soviet
                            Union, noting that he was not sure that he would not do it even now. He
                            observed that these actions by the Soviet Union were in contradiction to
                            the USSR’s claim that it wishes to relieve tensions. He recalled his
                            warning to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in New
                            York that harassment of access may lead to war and urged that it be
                            stopped so as to avoid catastrophic consequences. He pointed out that
                            the chances for agreement in Geneva on much bigger things would be
                            jeopardized should the Soviet harassment activity continue.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that we knew the identity, the origin, and the
                            destination of the bombers involved, as well as their flight patterns,
                            and said that chaff had been dropped precisely in the corridor. He
                            pointed out that this activity could not have been the result of
                            maneuvers outside the corridor.</p>
                        <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0046"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that as far the
                            question of corridors was concerned the Soviet Union had replied to the
                            West in its note.<note n="1" xml:id="d7fn1">For texts of the February 15
                                Western note and the February 17 Soviet reply, see <hi rend="italic"
                                    >American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1962</hi>, pp.
                                687–689.</note> The Soviet Union disagreed with the Western
                            statements that Soviet planes were flying through the air lanes (he
                            avoided the term “corridor”) in violation of the existing agreements and
                            past practice. The Soviet Union could not recognize the West as arbiter
                            in interpreting the existing situation. He claimed that the US
                            assessment of the situation was apparently based on incorrect
                            conclusions by some of its experts. In preparing its note, the USSR had
                            studied the situation, including the existing agreements and past
                            practices, and had based its reply on that study. If the United States
                            intended to take steps to ensure its interests, that was its own
                            business, but the USSR would also take steps to ensure its own
                            interests, as well as those of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>,
                            and would not yield them. Therefore, one must appraise the situation
                            more calmly, taking into account the best interests of all concerned.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asserted that the
                            USSR did not wish to heighten tensions in connection with Berlin and
                            Germany, as well as Europe in general. He professed that the USSR
                            desired an international detente, as he had stated to the Secretary in
                            New York and to the President in Washington. It would be best if an
                            agreed solution to all these problems could be reached. He alleged that
                            the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName>
                            were attempting to dramatize the situation by referring to some
                            unidentified bombers which had dropped chaff, and said that the reports
                            about these activities, which he had read in the Western press, were a
                            strictly Western responsibility. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> rejected <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord
                                Home</persName>’s warning, saying the latter should weigh his words
                            and keep such language to himself. He asserted that what should be done
                            here was to find a way of easing the situation and to promote the
                            solution of questions of interest to all concerned, rather than to give
                            warnings.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> inquire with his Defense Ministry so as to see
                            that the bombers involved had indeed come from the USSR, dropped chaff,
                            and returned back to the Soviet Union. The Secretary then referred to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s assertions that
                            the USSR wished to ease tensions. He said that this was one voice of the
                            USSR. The other voice of the USSR was what was happening in Berlin. The
                            problem was to find out which was the authentic voice of the USSR, since
                            the two did not speak the same language.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> interjected that there
                            was no point in using such enigmatic language and asserted that the USSR
                            spoke with only one voice.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that then we must weigh the voice we always considered
                            to be authentic, but that we must also weigh the events in the
                            corridors.</p>
                        <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0047"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> reiterated that the
                            USSR did not believe that it was violating the existing agreements with
                            regard to the air lanes. Thus there was no such contradiction as the
                            Secretary was referring to. He also reiterated that the USSR would not
                            yield and would continue to protect its interests in the air lanes, as
                            well as the interests of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, which
                            was an ally of the Soviet Union. He asserted again that the USSR was
                            still seeking agreement on these questions and that it had not changed
                            its view that these problems should be resolved on the basis of an
                            understanding with the West. Otherwise, there would have been no talks
                            with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> in
                            Moscow and no meeting here in Geneva. The USSR was prepared to talk here
                            in Geneva about these matters but it did not see any contradiction
                            between its statements regarding its desire for a detente and its
                            activities in the air lanes or, to use Western language, air corridors.
                            He then wondered where the true voice of the United States was.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted the lateness of the hour but said he wished to make
                            only two comments. First, it was a simple and fundamental principle that
                            any rights the USSR had in East Germany or Berlin rested only on one
                            basis, which was also the basis of Western presence in West Berlin and
                            of access to that city, namely, the surrender of Nazi Germany;
                            therefore, the Soviet Union was in no position to infringe upon the
                            rights of the Western Powers in Berlin or East Germany. All this was so
                            simple and fundamental that sometimes it was even difficult to
                            understand. Secondly, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            would be well advised to get in touch with his Government and stop such
                            actions as would necessarily interfere with the settlement of the
                            problems to be discussed here in Geneva. The Secretary then observed
                            that in the following days he would inevitably listen with two ears; one
                            to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, and one to what
                            happened in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that he would
                            be listening with both ears to the Secretary as well as to what the West
                            did in Berlin. If the US intended to complicate the situation in the air
                            lanes, then the United States, and perhaps other governments, would have
                            to bear full responsibility for that.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired, in a jocular manner, whether Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was going to telephone the
                            Soviet Commandant in Berlin and have him change the Soviet flight
                            plans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> responded that the
                            Secretary should not prompt him as to how he should conduct his
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> remarked that if Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> telephoned his
                            Defense Minister he would find out about the chaffing operation.</p>
                        <p>The conversation ended with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> again denying any knowledge of such
                            operation.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> hosted a luncheon at
                            the Soviet Mission.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> opened the
                            conversation by raising the question of Berlin. He referred to the US
                            view that this question should be discussed here in Geneva, and said
                            that since both sides had this desire, perhaps it would be worthwhile to
                            do so.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed that this would be useful to discuss this problem.
                            He stated that the United States had reviewed the exchanges of views
                            that had taken place on this subject since last June, some of them at
                            the highest level and some at the diplomatic level, and had attempted to
                            assess the current situation. He said he wished to comment on the more
                            important elements of that situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed regret that it had not been possible to find a
                            way of resolving this problem so as to stabilize the situation and to
                            remove the dangers involved. He expressed the view that it was important
                            to place Berlin in the context of the broader positions of the US and
                            USSR and of their responsibility as great powers. He said he knew that
                            the President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            understood the historical role they were to play and pointed out that
                            the shape of history over the next decade may depend on how they resolve
                            that problem. He recalled the President’s conversation with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName><note n="1"
                                xml:id="d8fn1">For a memorandum of the President’s conversation with
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> on June 4,
                                1961, see <ref target="frus1961-63v14#d33">vol. XIV, Document
                                    33</ref>.</note> about the ideological difference between them
                            and their recognition that neither could change the views of the other.
                            He expressed the belief that the differences relating to the internal
                            organization of the two states were not important to their relations. In
                            this connection the Secretary observed that the leader of the USSR of
                            the 1920’s would not recognize the USSR of <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27"
                                facs="0049"/>today; nor would the leaders of the US of that period
                            recognize the US of today. Changes had occurred and would occur in both
                            countries and they were not important to their mutual relation. The
                            Secretary observed that the differences in the US and USSR outlook on
                            the development of the international community, referred to by the
                            President in his interview with <persName corresp="#p_AAI1"
                                >Adzhubei</persName>, were perhaps more troublesome. The United
                            States believed in the development of independent states under the
                            Charter of the United Nations, whereas the USSR seemed to have
                            commitments with regard to revolutionary movements. Even so, this was
                            not fundamental in our problems.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed the belief that the firmest basis on which the
                            two sides should consider their problems was that of their common
                            interests. Both sides had interests in their security, their future, and
                            the development of the well-being of their peoples. They also had a
                            great deal of unfinished business at home. For its part, the US would be
                            only too glad to turn to those internal tasks. The USSR should turn to
                            the resolution of the problems standing between them, that would bring
                            important change in the international scene. Also, if progress were made
                            in the disarmament field both sides could devote greater resources to
                            their internal economic development. The Secretary stressed that the US
                            had come to Geneva to engage in serious and careful negotiations to make
                            steps in the disarmament field in spite of its disappointing experience
                            over the past 15 years. He expressed the view that unless the US and the
                            USSR succeeded in resolving this problem there would be competition in
                            armaments and an increase in the dangers on the international scene.
                            Although there were some people who apparently did not believe that
                            peaceful coexistence was possible, the Secretary said he held the
                            opposite view. In this connection, he cited the fact that the US and the
                            USSR had lived in peace during a period of over 40 years.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s remark that the Berlin situation had been
                            inherited from the previous governments of the two countries. However,
                            the Secretary said, he did not wish to go into the details of history.
                            What he wished to stress was that both sides should proceed on the basis
                            of their state interests in Central Europe. On that basis, the problem
                            boiled down to the simple proposition that the USSR had been taking a
                            one-sided approach: when the West wished to take up its rights on land,
                            in the air, and in Berlin on a juridical basis, the USSR said that we
                            should proceed on the basis of facts; on the other hand, when the West
                            cited facts, the USSR stated that facts should be changed. The United
                            States did not believe that relations between Great Powers were possible
                            on the basis of such an approach. In fact, if the USSR should press this
                            approach it would not be to its advantage either, because that might
                            lead to a massive rearmament of the West and also give rise to extremist
                            elements in the various countries which might be difficult <pb n="28"
                                xml:id="pg_28" facs="0050"/>to handle. Such a situation would
                            require diversion of resources from the peaceful development of our two
                            peoples.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that the United States was aware that the
                            situation in East Germany was not satisfactory from the standpoint of
                            the USSR and the East German authorities. The fact that many people had
                            left East Germany was probably a source of concern both to the USSR and
                            the East German authorities. Thus the USSR appeared to believe that this
                            unstable situation required solution. However, the US did not believe
                            that the USSR had a right to transfer the burden of that situation to
                            the West.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the US–USSR exchanges of views over the past months, the
                            Secretary wondered whether both sides should not approach the problem on
                            the basis of their total interests and on the basis of the points of
                            agreement and disagreement between them. While the US could not speak
                            for the USSR, it was convinced that both sides had a common interest in
                            peace. If this was not the case, the Secretary observed, then the
                            further remarks he was going to make would be irrelevant.</p>
                        <p>Noting that he was not suggesting any Western allied positions on any
                            points, although the US was of course aware of the views of its allies,
                            the Secretary stated that, speaking on behalf of the President, he
                            wished to put forward certain thoughts designed to place the situation
                            under control and to put the problem in proper perspective in the
                            context of the broader interests of both sides. He suggested that
                            perhaps an attempt could be made to find certain principles to which
                            both sides could subscribe and a procedure for negotiations on the basis
                            of those principles, and to undertake certain steps while negotiations
                            were proceeding so that there would be no danger of crises.</p>
                        <p>Citing Berlin as an example, the Secretary said that both Governments had
                            stated, although in different terms, that West Berlin should be free to
                            choose its own way of life, that its viability should be maintained, and
                            that access to it should be free and unhindered. Perhaps that is a
                            general proposition to which both sides could give their accord. If such
                            a general proposition were agreed, ways could be found of improving the
                            situation in Berlin on the basis of these principles. In the meantime,
                            both sides would also state that existing access procedures would remain
                            in effect.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then referred to the problem of the diffusion of nuclear
                            weapons and noted that the USSR had apparently expressed an interest in
                            and concern about the US policy with regard to it. The United States,
                            for its part, was also interested in and concerned about the Soviet
                            policy in this respect. The Secretary expressed the belief that both
                            sides had a common interest in not having nuclear weapons pass into the
                            hands of others. He suggested that both sides could perhaps agree that
                                <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0051"/>further diffusion of nuclear
                            weapons into the hands of national governments now not owning such
                            weapons would not further the cause of peace. Then, in negotiations, a
                            system providing for non-diffusion of nuclear weapons might be developed
                            to which all states owning nuclear weapons, as well as those now not
                            owning such weapons might subscribe. In the meantime, both sides would
                            declare that they would not themselves relinquish control over any
                            nuclear weapons to any individual state now not owning such weapons and
                            would refrain from assisting any such state in manufacturing such
                            weapons.</p>
                        <p>As a third example of the suggested approach, the Secretary referred to
                            the problem of non-aggression. He noted that the US and USSR with their
                            respective allies were not in a major confrontation in Central Europe
                            and that it would be tragic if force were used and if uncontrollable
                            events were set in motion. There would be few survivors to conduct a
                            post mortem on our mistakes in dealing with this problem. Therefore,
                            both sides could undertake the commitment not to use force to bring
                            about a change in the status quo. In further negotiations, a declaration
                            by all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Warsaw Pact members
                            might be developed and specific measures by all governments might be
                            considered to establish their non-aggressive intent and to reduce the
                            risk of war by accident or miscalculation. In the meantime, both sides
                            could undertake not to use force to change the existing borders or
                            demarcation lines in Germany and would note with approval West Germany’s
                            declaration that it would not use force for those purposes.</p>
                        <p>Noting that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> might have
                            some additional points to suggest along the above-mentioned lines, the
                            Secretary said that perhaps he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> could find a procedure for reaching agreement on
                            a set of such principles and then heads of government might meet to
                            conclude the agreement. Throughout this process, both sides would of
                            course wish to remain in touch with their respective allies. As to the
                            forum for future negotiations on the basis of those principles, the
                            Secretary suggested that it could perhaps consist of the Deputy Foreign
                            Ministers of the US, the USSR, the UK and France. However, that would be
                            contingent upon substantial agreement in advance and on the absence of
                            actions aggravating the international situation.</p>
                        <p>By way of a post script, the Secretary stressed that the United States
                            wished to make very serious progress in the disarmament field and hoped
                            to find ways of managing those serious problems which stood in the way
                            to such progress.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> responded by stating
                            that the Soviet Government deeply regretted that no agreement on a
                            German peace treaty had been possible so far. In spite of Soviet efforts
                            to reach agreement with the United States and its allies, the period
                            elapsed had shown that agreement was still far away. He claimed that the
                            reason for this situation lay <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0052"/>in
                            the US unwillingness to take into account the existing facts resulting
                            from World War II, and in particular the existence of two sovereign
                            German states. Whether the West liked it or not, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> existed, just as the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> existed. He asserted that the authors
                            of post war agreements could not foresee the situation existing now,
                            since they had proceeded on the premise that there would be one, united,
                            demilitarized, sovereign, and peaceful Germany. The situation was now
                            different, and the world could see that there were two sovereign German
                            states in existence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had pointed out this fact to the President in
                            Vienna and had stressed that 16 years had passed since World War II and
                            that the situation, which in the absence of a peace treaty had become
                            bad and wrong, could not be left unchanged. This was why the USSR had
                            proposed a two-fold formula for a German peace treaty; either two peace
                            treaties—one with each of the two Germanies, or a single treaty with
                            both Germanies. Thus, when the USSR referred to a German peace treaty it
                            had in mind these two formulae. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> contended that the USSR still believed that the
                            best solution would be if agreement were reached with the West to
                            conclude a German peace treaty. However, since the US and its allies had
                            stated that they would not participate in a peace treaty with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, the Soviet Government was prepared to
                            resolve the question on the basis of the USSR’s, along with other states
                            that might wish to do so, signing a peace treaty, accompanied by the
                            settlement of a number of other problems, including West Berlin, on the
                            basis of negotiations between the US and the USSR and their respective
                            allies. He recalled his conversation with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> on this subject in Moscow.
                            Referring to the general principles mentioned by the Secretary, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said they failed to
                            include such an important principle as due respect for the sovereignty
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He stressed that the Soviet
                            Union would not accept any arrangements infringing upon the sovereignty
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He said that this meant that
                            the question of communications to West Berlin could be agreed only on
                            the basis of respect for the sovereign rights of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, i.e., on the basis of the established
                            international practice with regard to transit by land, air, and water.
                            The question of communications was insolubly linked to the question of
                            the status of West Berlin, a point which the Secretary had failed to
                            mention. The status of West Berlin must be resolved on the basis of a
                            peace treaty, although the US may not take part in such treaty. To the
                            USSR West Berlin was only a part of the German problem, whereas the
                            Secretary’s general principles were limited to West Berlin alone. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then recalled the
                            Soviet draft on the status of a free city of West Berlin<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d8fn2">A copy of the draft statute for West Berlin, handed
                                to <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> by <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at their second meeting on
                                January 12, is in Department of State, Hillenbrand Files: Lot 84 F
                                53, Box 1, Folder 8.</note> and contended <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31"
                                facs="0053"/>that the USSR did not seek to affect the social order
                            in West Berlin established by the population of that city. He reiterated
                            that two points were missing from the Secretary’s list of general
                            principles: (1) respect for the sovereignty of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and (2) status of West Berlin. He then
                            recalled Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            statement that the USSR did not need West Berlin—not a single acre, or
                            street, or house in West Berlin was needed by the Soviet Union. Nor did
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> have any need for West Berlin.
                            At the same time, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was making a
                            great concession, even a sacrifice, in agreeing to West Berlin’s
                            becoming a free city.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said that the
                            Soviet Union was prepared to approach the question of a German peace
                            treaty from any end, although it was not prepared to have that question
                            approached in a one-sided manner. The Secretary had mentioned only
                            questions of interest to the US and had failed to mention matters of
                            interest to the USSR and its allies.</p>
                        <p>As to the substance of the status of a free city in West Berlin, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the Soviet
                            proposals on this subject were well known and therefore there was no
                            need for repeating them. The Secretary was familiar with the Soviet
                            proposals with regard to the stationing of token contingents of troops
                            in West Berlin and with the different variants of that proposal. The
                            Secretary was also familiar with the Soviet position with regard to the
                            question of access. As to the latter question, the USSR was convinced
                            that the requirements of unrestricted access and of genuine respect for
                            the sovereignty of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, a respect that
                            should not be only on paper, could both be satisfied. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that if the West were
                            interested in unrestricted access and if it agreed to respect the
                            sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, then the way to
                            agreement was open. Otherwise, if the West were interested in
                            unrestricted access but wished to ignore the sovereignty of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, the way to agreement was closed.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the Secretary’s suggestion with regard to general
                            principles, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> observed
                            that this was something new, at least in form, and that he did not
                            exclude the possibility of first reaching agreement on a set of general
                            principles, then gradually developing those principles, and ultimately
                            reaching agreement on a detailed basis. However, the interests of all
                            parties concerned must be taken into account in that process, and
                            therefore both sides should jointly consider the situation to develop a
                            mutually acceptable set of principles.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the Secretary’s general remarks, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated that agreement between
                            the US and the USSR would undoubtedly be of tremendous importance to the
                            world situation. The Secretary had mentioned the US allies, but that, of
                            course, was a matter for the United States itself to handle. As for the
                            USSR, it wished to reach agreement. As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had mentioned to the President in Vienna, US
                            and Soviet interests were in direct confrontation only in one place on
                            the international scene. That confrontation was due to the abnormal
                            situation <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0054"/>in Germany, which in
                            turn had resulted from the fact that no peace treaty had been concluded
                            so many years after World War II. Therefore, if that question were
                            resolved on a mutually accepted basis, the international situation would
                            be radically improved and the source of friction would disappear. Of
                            course, there remained the disarmament problem. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asserted that as far as the
                            USSR was concerned, it had come to Geneva to attempt to resolve that
                            problem. But agreement on the question of a German peace treaty and the
                            settlement of the West Berlin problem on the basis of such a treaty
                            would certainly be of no detriment to the cause of disarmament. However,
                            there must be a desire on the part of all parties concerned to reach
                            agreement. Speeches such as those made by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and other, even civilian,
                            personalities in the United States brandishing nuclear arms were not
                            conducive to positive results. Methods of threat were now outmoded and
                            could not lead to any results. What both sides must do was seek to bring
                            their respective positions closer together.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the
                            Secretary had correctly interpreted the spirit of the Vienna meeting as
                            regards the lack of desire on either side to convert the other side to
                            its views and ideology. Both sides could live in peace and their desire
                            for peace must unite them in their work, including here in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that all of us could remember that the former Germany
                            had made the US and USSR allies, and noted that it would be a pity if
                            the present Germany were to make them enemies. Referring to the fact
                            that both sides had used the term “one-sided”, the Secretary wondered
                            whether the gap could be bridged if certain simple ideas were
                            established. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had
                            mentioned the existence of two Germanies. The United States would
                            certainly not deny that fact, but there were other facts, such as West
                            Berlin, Western presence in West Berlin, and Western access to it. All
                            these were facts as well. As to the question of a peace treaty, the
                            Secretary said that the US was not deeply concerned about the Soviet
                            intention to sign such a treaty, but we were deeply disturbed by what
                            the USSR had stated it intended to do in that connection. The USSR had
                            never disposed of our rights with regard to access and, therefore, it
                            could not transfer them to East Germany. In fact, the <persName

                            that exchange of letters also recognized that there were international
                            commitments with respect to Germany. However, since that time Soviet
                            demands appeared to have risen, although there had been no change in the
                            situation. This was what we called one-sided approach. Referring to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s contention that the
                            Secretary had failed to take into account Soviet interests,<pb n="33"
                                xml:id="pg_33" facs="0055"/> the Secretary stated that we were
                            prepared to talk about all of Germany, all of Berlin, or any aspect of
                            the problem. As to the question of the so-called respect for the
                            sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, the Secretary
                            said that he did not believe there was great difficulty on this point,
                            because no one in the West intended to have things happening in the
                            corridors that would interfere with the affairs of East German
                            authorities. On the other hand, the 1955 exchange of letters had not
                            placed access under the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty
                            and it was impossible to see how the USSR could do it now. The Secretary
                            concluded the conversation by reiterating that our problem was not the
                            Soviet intention to sign a peace treaty, but only what such a treaty
                            would do to us.<note n="4" xml:id="d8fn4"><p>At 6 p.m. on March 12

                                seriousness in view of these known provocative actions of the USSR.
                                In fact, the Secretary of State and the British Foreign Minister
                                should leave immediately after the opening of the conference unless
                                events would make it seem advisable for them to stay. Certainly they
                                should leave if there is no forthcoming response from the USSR.

                        <p>The Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> met
                            for one hour prior to the luncheon hosted by the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary opened the conversation by expressing his appreciation of
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s coming before lunch
                            to talk very privately on one or two points.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he thought it might be useful to explore
                            whether communications could be established across the gulf which
                            appeared to separate the two sides. He observed that it was not clear
                            what each side had precisely in mind when it made statements. Recalling
                            the President’s meeting with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> in Vienna and the subsequent exchanges of
                            views, the Secretary stated the US had supposed that when Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> raised the question of
                            Berlin and Germany his problem was to stabilize the situation from the
                            standpoint of Soviet interest, particularly with regard to those parts
                            of Germany which were under Soviet control and responsibility. The
                            United States has refrained from protesting or interfering unduly
                            because it had recognized that the situation perhaps warranted attention
                            from the Soviet viewpoint. However, the Secretary noted, the present
                            situation no longer warranted this kind of assessment of what Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had meant. What
                            was now being done and said indicated an intention to do what the
                            President had said in Vienna the US could not accept, i.e., diminish the
                            Western position in Berlin and Germany while strengthening the Soviet
                            and Bloc position in that situation. The Secretary observed that if
                            there were no intention to move against the vital interests of the West
                            in Germany and Berlin, other things might fall in place and could be
                            adjusted. He stressed, however, that if there were an intention to drive
                            the West out of Berlin, then there was a serious problem at hand both in
                            Washington and Moscow.</p>
                        <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0058"/>
                        <p>Referring to the question of the so-called respect for the sovereignty of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, the Secretary stated that this
                            raised no problem if it meant that access should not interfere with the
                            internal affairs of East Germany. On the other hand, there was a grave
                            problem if this meant that East Germany could interfere with access. The
                            Secretary stressed the view that both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> and himself should be able to clarify the
                            language they used with each other. If there was no problem, both sides
                            could see what political action could be taken; conversely, if there was
                            a problem, then one would have to proceed on that basis.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that the same point could be illustrated in
                            other ways. For example, Moscow had talked a great deal about a peace
                            treaty. The Secretary said that a peace treaty between Moscow and Pankow
                            was of no particular concern to the US if it was clear that such a
                            treaty would not attempt to do what it could not do, namely, dispose of
                            Western rights and access. He recalled in this connection that this had
                            been recognized in the formula of the 1955 <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1"
                                >Zorin</persName>-Bolz understanding. A treaty with such a formula
                            would not create crisis or tensions. Turning to the question of
                            recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, the Secretary
                            recalled Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement
                            to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> that the
                            West already recognized the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He said
                            that it was true that the US acted on the basis that there was a place
                            called <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and that there were
                            authorities which were in control there. From that standpoint, there
                            should be no problem. However, both sides should explore what lay behind
                            their statements, so that they could see what each side had in mind and
                            that they could communicate efficiently and see how to deal with the
                            situation, rather than stay apart through lack of understanding.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he had listened
                            attentively to the Secretary’s remarks and that his impression was that
                            the Secretary had essentially repeated what he had said before. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> claimed that he had
                            tried to detect new points in the Secretary’s remarks but had failed to
                            see such points. With reference to the meaning of the phrase “respect
                            for the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>”, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated that both
                            sides should agree that, in matters relating to communications and
                            access to West Berlin, specific questions should be decided in
                            accordance with the accepted international practice, i.e., all questions
                            pertaining to transit by land, air, and water should be resolved in
                            accordance with that practice. While that practice was a long
                            established one and had concrete content, it might find different
                            expression in different documents. In brief, it meant that states across
                            whose territory transit took place must be respected and be allowed to
                            live and develop as sovereign and independent states. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> reiterated his view expressed
                            previously that it was possible to reconcile such respect with the
                            requirement of free access. Thus, if the United States Government and
                            the other Western Powers were prepared <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37"
                                facs="0059"/>to agree that in reaching an understanding on
                            unrestricted access, an understanding must also be reached with regard
                            to respect for the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> in accordance with International Law, then the way to
                            agreement was open. Conversely, if the US sought agreement on free
                            access which would ignore the sovereign rights of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, then the way to agreement was closed.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he did not know
                            whether his remarks would dispell the Secretary’s doubts, but said the
                            Soviet Union did believe it possible to reconcile these two
                            requirements. He said that when both sides got down to elaborating
                            specific agreements, this would be formulated in specific language. In
                            this connection, he noted that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                                >Thompson</persName> had received the Soviet draft of a possible
                                formula.<note n="1" xml:id="d10fn1"><persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                    >Gromyko</persName> had given <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                                    >Thompson</persName> the draft declaration at their meeting on
                                January 12; see <ref target="frus1961-63v14#d264">vol. XIV, Document
                                    264</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>Referring to the Secretary’s remarks regarding diminution of Western
                            rights, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> contended
                            that they were unfounded and that it was wrong to pose the question in
                            this manner. He claimed that assertions that the Soviet Union intended
                            to drive the West out of West Berlin, to detract from the vital
                            interests of the West, or even to take hold of West Berlin either for
                            itself or East Germany were completely unfounded. The USSR was convinced
                            that a German peace treaty and the settlement of the West Berlin
                            question on the basis of such a treaty would not entail any loss for any
                            of the Western powers. The USSR did not believe that a peace treaty and
                            the creation of a free city of West Berlin would lead to the weakening
                            of the Western position, or of the US position in particular. On the
                            contrary, the USSR believed that such a settlement would strengthen the
                            positions of all concerned since it would remove forever the source of
                            tension and the fever now shaking all of Western Europe. He reiterated
                            that it was incorrect to put the question in a way that implied that
                            somebody was to take something and somebody was to give. He expressed
                            the view that a settlement of this problem would lead to a settlement of
                            relations between the US and USSR.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then referred to the
                            principle of respect for the existing way of life in West Berlin, which
                            had been mentioned by the Secretary the day before. He claimed that this
                            principle was part of the Soviet position, which was based on the
                            premise that West Berlin should enjoy the social order desired by its
                            population and that there should be no interference from the outside. He
                            professed bewilderment as to why the <hi rend="italic">US</hi> had such
                            “Mont Blancs” of doubts with regard to Soviet intentions and said he
                            assumed the US had mountains of files with papers ascribing to the USSR
                            the intention to dupe the other side and all sorts of other cunning
                            motives. He recalled Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s efforts in Vienna to persuade <pb n="38"
                                xml:id="pg_38" facs="0060"/>the President that a settlement of this
                            problem was in the interest of both sides.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated there was a big difference between the two types of
                            approach. One thing was to propose a solution and say that it was good
                            for the other side; it was another thing to recognize that each side had
                            vital interests and to see how the problem could be resolved in what
                            both sides believed to be in accord with their interests. He stressed
                            that the US could not accept the Soviet proposition that the Soviet
                            proposal was in the US interest. He expressed the view that both sides
                            could accept that each of them had vital interests in Central Europe and
                            that they should see how those interests could be adjusted.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the question of the so-called respect for the sovereignty of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, the Secretary noted the fact
                            that the West had had over many years agreement with the USSR with
                            regard to access rights. He stated that it was not incompatible with the
                            sovereignty or rights of any authority to accept such an agreement. The
                            understanding between Moscow and Pankow fully protected this point. As
                            to access by air, the Secretary noted that it was proper practice today
                            to have transit across territories take place without the slightest
                            interference from those on the ground. Therefore, there should be no
                            incompatibility in this matter, unless there was an intention to impose
                            restrictions and control over such rights.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we had no difficulty with the known fact that
                            East Germans administered certain parts of access and coordinated
                            traffic on water, rail, and the Autobahn. He noted that there was
                            already a considerable amount of direct East German participation in
                            this matter. Therefore, there should be no practical problem.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Secretary stated that he could accept Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement that there was no
                            ground to suppose that the USSR was trying to diminish the position of
                            the Western Powers. He expressed readiness to sit down and to discuss
                            the problem on that basis. He recalled that he had mentioned several
                            points the day before,<note n="2" xml:id="d10fn2">See <ref target="#d8"
                                    >Document 8</ref>.</note> although there might be some others,
                            which needed to be discussed along these lines.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he wished the
                            Secretary to understand correctly his statement that adoption of the
                            Soviet proposals for a peace treaty, even if such a treaty were to be
                            signed only by the Soviet Union with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>, for the creation of a free city of West Berlin, and
                            for free access to that city under conditions of respect for the
                            sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would be in the
                            interest of all concerned. The Soviet Union believed that such a
                            settlement would not undermine or diminish the position of any state
                            because it would ease tensions rather than worsen the prospects <pb
                                n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0061"/>for peace and security.
                            Furthermore, the Soviet Union strongly believed that such a settlement
                            would even strengthen the positions of all concerned since it was in the
                            interest of peace.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated that
                            he had noted that the Secretary, in referring to the sovereignty of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, had used formulations which
                            raised quite a few questions in his mind. The Secretary had mentioned
                            that access had been operating so far and that there had been no
                            problem. However, there were many things in the past which no longer
                            existed. At one time, the Germans could not even cross the street
                            without first obtaining permission from either American or Soviet
                            soldiers. Those things were due to Germany’s unconditional surrender.
                            Yet the situation had changed, both in East and West Germany; therefore,
                            we must proceed on the basis of the existing situation, although some
                            may not like it, a situation which was highlighted primarily by the
                            existence of two German states.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary interjected that there was also Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued that the
                            Soviet Union did not wish to pocket anything as a result of a
                            settlement. He observed that he liked the Secretary’s statement of
                            yesterday that the US and USSR had been allies against Germany and that
                            Germany should not make them enemies. He concluded by saying that both
                            sides had fought against Germany and must draw certain conclusions from
                            that fact.<note n="3" xml:id="d10fn3">At 11 p.m. on March 13 <persName

                        <p>Key question is effect on West Berlin morale both of present level Soviet
                            actions and countermeasures we may take. I see <persName
                                corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName>’s dilemma as to attitude he should
                            take in Berlin. If he says there is no physical danger to air access
                            (which he believes is true) he might invite increased Soviet action. If
                            he says there is danger he could start panic. I have some sympathy his
                            suggestion that we send armed aircraft through corridors but have some
                            concern that this might create panic regarding air travel we are trying
                            to avoid. In this connection believe it would be important obtain
                            estimate Bonn as to whether introduction fighters would affect
                            willingness Panam and other civil airlines continue operations under
                            these circumstances. My own first reaction, however, is that we should
                            not refrain from sending occasional armed aircraft through fear of
                            escalation corridor situation because (a) indefinite prolongation
                            present Soviet practices cannot be accepted and (b) strong line taken by

                            and ambassadorial group consider urgently what we should recommend to

                            different circumstances, might be one such measure. Extending <persName

                                        our last trump before actual fighting and, (ii) militarily,
                                            <persName corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName> is not
                                        sanguine about the outcome. Also the question was raised as
                                        to the various alternative ways that fighters could be
                                        employed. Although armed escort is possible, it is difficult
                                        and would probably not be a first choice. On the other hand,
                                        simply flying armed escorts occasionally through the
                                        corridors, though it might sound a warning, would have no
                                        direct effect whatsoever on Soviet tactics <pb n="43"

                                        military or civilian aircraft, and if the latter, whether

                            <item>I raised the question of necessity to distinguish carefully the
                                basis for our taking a further action. Clearly the Soviet harassment
                                has had no significant effect upon our access. In fact, in this
                                regard, up to this point in time, one might say that the Soviets are
                                failing in their activity. On the other hand, the need to respond to
                                the Soviets might nevertheless justify an action. In this event, I
                                raised the question of a possible ultimatum of breaking up the
                                Geneva Conference within a specified period if the Soviets did not
                                cease and desist.</item>

                            been received. He strongly recommends against either going above 10,000
                            feet or using fighters. He feels that the Soviet attempts have been
                            ineffectual and that accordingly a response beyond that heretofore
                            utilized is not required. (We have also received a telephonic message
                            from Geneva indicating that the Secretary supports <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName>’s view.) Accordingly, I do not
                            believe anything will go out on this matter tonight. However, I have
                            suggested to <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> that we send a cable to
                            the Secretary in Geneva pointing out that in light of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName> position, the question really
                            boils down to whether we feel it is necessary, as a matter of principle,
                            to respond to the arrogant Soviet actions which result in our
                            negotiating in Geneva under duress. If we do, then rather than take
                            action in the corridors we might better give the Soviets a direct
                            warning to the effect that unless the harassment in the corridors ends
                            we will end the discussions at Geneva. This course of action would only
                            be logical if one assumes that the Soviets do not desire a break-off in
                            the Geneva talks. This is a point which must be weighed in the balance,
                            and we have obviously not had time to do so.</p>

                        <p>On March 15 Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                >Kohler</persName> hosted a working luncheon for Deputy Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> opened their conversation by
                            stating that since he and <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName>
                            were primarily responsible for Germany at the working level, it might be
                            useful to talk about it informally. Following a brief exchange on the
                            need to clarify whatever points could be clarified, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> turned to the Soviet harassments
                            in the air corridors to Berlin, and stated that the Soviet Union seemed
                            to be making a deliberate attempt to interfere with Western access.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> stressed that
                            everything the Soviet Union was doing was <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45"
                                facs="0067"/>perfectly legal, but after being confronted with all
                            the details, he came close to admitting the charge.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> spent a considerable amount of
                            time discussing the meaning of “respect for the sovereignty of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” and how this might be
                            reconciled with free access to Berlin. Then <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                >Kohler</persName> presented in broad outline the U.S. concept of a

                                corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> thanked <persName
                                corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> for his views, but concluded
                            that the United States still was not taking into account the Soviet

                                <item>The real reason why the Soviets desire to change the existing
                                    situation in Berlin is to do away with the Allied control
                                    represented by the occupation regime in order to eliminate
                                    certain types of activity in the city, i.e., <gloss

                                        >Semenov</persName> mentioned that they “knew” that this was
                                    used as a source of operational instructions to agents in the

                                    Berlin, in its present state, created a constant source of
                                    friction with the Soviet Union and implied that this was one of
                                    the major reasons why they desired a change in its
                                    status.</item>

                                <item>The free city concept seemed to be a means of bringing about
                                    an end to what he referred to as “organic links” with the <gloss
                                        target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. He mentioned that in the

                                    maintained, citing as an example the case of Austria. He
                                    emphasized the fact that despite the Allied veto of the
                                    incorporation of West Berlin into the Federal Republic this was
                                    merely a paper veto and the relationship in fact is as though
                                    West Berlin were a Land of the Federal Republic. He <pb n="47"
                                        xml:id="pg_47" facs="0069"/>referred again to the fact that
                                    this had not always been the case and mentioned specifically the
                                    B-mark question of the late 40’s. He admitted on this point that
                                    one of the main purposes of the Soviet Union was to prevent the
                                    extension of what he termed German revanchist and militaristic
                                    activities in West Berlin. He compared these activities in West
                                    Berlin as the end of a cable whose source was West Germany.

                                    stress on the danger that the German militarist sentiment and
                                    activity would succeed in bringing the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.
                                    into conflict and that it was to avoid this possibility that the

                                    stated that the question of the presence of Allied forces in the

                                    but later on in discussing our objections to the concept of a
                                    free and neutral city, he said that this might be reconciled
                                    with the presence of Western forces.</item>

                                    really meant by this reiterated statement; i.e., whether this
                                    would involve <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> control over
                                    the traffic of persons and goods to and from West Berlin.</item>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> throughout stressed
                            the dangers of German militarism as a source of U.S./U.S.S.R. conflict
                            and asserted several times that the Soviets had no intention of harming
                            U.S. interest. He was, however, impressed by our statement that whatever
                            might be the Soviet intentions, the objective results of the course of
                            action which they proposed would inevitably result in a loss of Western
                            influence and position in regard to Berlin. He had no particular answer
                            to our statements that the East Berlin leaders have frequently made
                            specific what their intentions in this regard were, and said we should
                            not pay too much attention to statements of others, mentioning alleged
                            statements of some of our military in Berlin. He stressed throughout the
                            importance of reaching some understanding while admitting the great
                            difficulties which stood in the way of its achievement, and his outline
                            of Soviet objectives in regard to Berlin was somewhat more precise than
                            in previous discussions with the Soviets although containing nothing
                            exceptionally new.</p>
                        <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0070"/>
                        <p>It seems clear that Soviet objectives are: (i) to eliminate Berlin as an
                            Allied control center, (ii) to bring to an end what he claimed to be the
                            organic links to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> which, in their
                            version makes it a hot bed of “revanchist and militaristic” propaganda
                            and activities incompatible with the establishment of “normal”
                            relationships between our two countries and the general purpose of
                            stabilization of the German situation on the basis of two Germanies. The
                            Soviet insistence that Eastern Berlin and what went on there was “not a
                            question” but a situation in fact which was definitely set forth. The
                            only time he reacted sharply was when reference was made to our right,
                            in view of the Soviet actions in East Berlin, to the incorporation of
                            West Berlin into the Federal Republic, and he remarked “You just try
                            that!”</p>
                        <p>The general impression of the conversation was that the Soviets are
                            anxious to explore possibilities of a mutually acceptable solution.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> gave a somewhat
                            clearer outline of Soviet reasons in the various suggestions they had
                            put forward. There was no give, however, nor clarification of the phrase
                            “respect for the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            in respect to access rights.” He referred on a number of occasions to
                            unrestricted access but declined to be specific as to how this would
                            relate to East German sovereignty.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> hosted a dinner at the
                            Soviet Mission.</p>
                        <p>Following a brief conversation on how the disarmament conference should
                            proceed, in the course of which the Secretary had pointed out the
                            relationship between the Crisis around Berlin and the possibility of
                            achieving disarmament, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> suggested that no crises should be created and
                            claimed that the Soviet proposals were designed to knock the ground from
                            under crises. He compared the present situation to the walking on a
                            tight rope, which was fraught with all sorts of possible surprises. A
                            situation where there was no peace treaty, where troops were stationed
                            in West Berlin, where the occupation regime prevailed in that city, and
                            where the sovereign rights of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            were encroached upon, may generate situations neither of the two sides
                            wanted.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded by saying that, in his view, the situation we
                            were facing today was as follows: The Soviet Union had made some
                            proposals since 1958 which were unacceptable to the West in the literal
                            sense of the word. The fact that the Soviet Union had pursued those
                            proposals for three years might be an indication of the importance the
                            Soviet Union attached to them, but this did not make them more
                            acceptable. The Secretary expressed the view that the exchanges between
                            the US and the USSR which had taken place since the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> administration had taken office
                            indicated that there was no movement toward agreement. What the United
                            States had said at Vienna and in the subsequent exchanges, apparently
                            had made little impression in Moscow. However, the Secretary emphasized,
                            everything that had been stated by the US was really meant and meant
                            seriously. The Secretary said that when we had come to Geneva it was
                            quite apparent that the <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0074"/>two sides
                            were not in agreement and that there was very little prospect of finding
                            agreement. Therefore, the question now was how to deal with the fact of
                            disagreement. He suggested that one way would be to start from the
                            existing situation. The Soviet Union had also suggested this approach
                            but without taking into account the complete set of facts. The Soviet
                            Union had said that there were two Germanies, but there was also the
                            fact that Berlin, and particularly West Berlin, also existed. The
                            Secretary emphasized that unless there was a radical change in the
                            Soviet attitude expressed since 1958 with respect to the vital interests
                            of the West, it was difficult to see how an understanding could be
                            reached, and thus our problem was to find ways of handling disagreement
                            without conflict which would have disastrous consequences for both of
                            our countries and the whole Northern Hemisphere as well.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> responded that if the
                            United States expected a radical change in the Soviet position, i.e.,
                            abandonment by the USSR of its proposals for a change in the West Berlin
                            situation, for a German peace treaty, and for respect of the sovereignty
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, then this was in vain since
                            the USSR would never agree to such a proposition. Both sides could and
                            must seek a solution that would meet the interests of both sides. Such a
                            solution would provide for: (1) a German peace treaty—perhaps without
                            Western participation, which would be regrettable; (2) a change in the
                            abnormal situation in West Berlin, a situation which had ensued from
                            Germany’s surrender; and (3) a change in the situation with regard to
                            respect for the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>,
                            which was now quite intolerable. He asserted that if both sides desired
                            to reach agreement, agreement could be reached. On the other hand, if
                            there was no such desire, the situation was quite different and the USSR
                            would have to take alone such steps as it had mentioned previously on
                            numerous occasions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that the conversation was moving towards
                            clarification. The Soviet Union had said that the West should withdraw.
                            We had said that we had a position in West Berlin which we would
                            maintain. These positions were in contradiction and the problem was what
                            we should do. We were prepared to deal with the factual situation, and
                            we were also prepared to deal with the theoretical situation by
                            advancing proposals on how the German situation should be resolved
                            permanently. What we could not accept was when the USSR said one thing
                            should be taken on the basis of facts and another on the basis of
                            theory. Neither side must act like a mother giving a spoonful of bitter
                            medicine to her child and saying “Take it, it’s good for you”. Each side
                            knew what its vital interests were and they must prevent a clash neither
                            of them wanted. The Secretary recalled the President’s remarks to
                                <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> that some problems
                            may be affected by time. Berlin may become more manageable with time.
                            However, the Secretary pointed out, this should <pb n="53"
                                xml:id="pg_53" facs="0075"/>not be interpreted as a desire to
                            procrastinate. He stressed that the USSR had denied Western vital
                            interests for more than 3 years and the US did not like that delay. If
                            we were to hurry, hurry toward agreement was one thing; but if the hurry
                            was not toward agreement then Moscow and Washington must think what they
                            were hurrying to.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> observed that bitter
                            medicine sometimes helped the patient. Remarking that taste was a
                            subjective matter, he professed bewilderment why the Soviet proposals
                            were considered bitter. The USSR held the opposite view, since its
                            proposal for a free city of West Berlin in connection with a German
                            peace treaty was designed to eliminate a source of friction, and there
                            was nothing bitter involved here. He asserted that the West always
                            ascribed sinister motives to the USSR.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the Secretary’s remarks that the Soviet Union had been
                            refusing over three years to recognize the Western rights in Berlin, he
                            claimed that this was not so and that the USSR was merely trying to
                            eliminate the abnormal situation which had resulted from Germany’s
                            unconditional surrender. As to the Secretary’s remark about facts and
                            theory, he contended that this was a somewhat arbitrary way of
                            interpreting the situation. The USSR believed that there were main facts
                            as well as subsidiary or secondary facts. The decisive fact was that two
                            Germanies existed as independent states. 17 years had passed since World
                            War II without a peace treaty and the USSR had concluded that a change
                            was necessary. As to the Secretary’s query how the USSR claimed to
                            proceed on the basis of facts but sought change, he asserted that there
                            was no contradiction here. All the USSR wanted was to normalize the
                            situation in Germany and Berlin and draw a line under World War II
                            through the conclusion of a peace treaty and by solving the West Berlin
                            problem on that basis. The Soviet Union had been repeating this phrase
                            because it wanted to convince the West. After all the Soviet Union was
                            negotiating and there was nothing else it could do in that situation
                            other than write and talk.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> contended that the
                            USSR was negotiating with the US in the hope that agreement could be
                            reached. The United States had also said that it wanted agreement. The
                            Secretary had said today that perhaps an understanding could be reached
                            on the basis of the existing factual situation. But such an
                            understanding would also represent agreement. The Secretary had said in
                            New York that both sides should agree on the factual situation, but it
                            was quite clear that agreement must somehow be recorded and formalized.
                            A peace treaty, even without Western participation, would do that, while
                            agreement on other matters could be formalized with Western
                            participation. If the US were not to say that it wished agreement, the
                            USSR would proceed differently. But since the US stated that it wanted
                            agreement, the USSR was negotiating with it.</p>
                        <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0076"/>
                        <p>The group then moved to the adjoining room for coffee.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary resumed the conversation by stating that he wished to draw
                            a distinction between negotiation and action. We had no doubt that any
                            government was free to raise any proposals as a matter of negotiations,
                            even though the other side might regard those proposals to be
                            outrageous. However, we were most concerned when suggestions were raised
                            which contemplated action without the consent of the other side. If
                            Moscow desired to stabilize the situation on the basis of the existing
                            facts, we had considerable understanding for this. This would be a
                            reflection of events which had taken place during and since the war.
                            However, it was our view that the heart of the existing situation was
                            our presence in West Berlin and the freedom of access to West Berlin. It
                            would be one thing to stabilize the situation and record it in a treaty
                            on the basis of the existing situation in West Berlin and the existing
                            access, as had been done in the <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1"
                                >Zorin</persName>-Bolz understanding, whereas it was quite a
                            different thing to propose a treaty providing for change in the
                            situation and contemplating action. This was so elementary to us that we
                            could not understand why the other side did not regard it as elementary
                            as well.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the Soviet paper received yesterday,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d18fn1">See <ref target="#d17fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    17</ref>.</note> the Secretary stated it was disappointing since
                            it provided no basis for discussion. The paper took no account of what
                            the President had said in Vienna or of US statements through the various
                            channels. It merely reflected the Soviet position advanced three years
                            ago and no solution was possible for that basis. Reiterating that both
                            sides could either reach agreement on the basis of the existing
                            situation or make proposals on how the situation should be changed and
                            then negotiated, the Secretary stated that the US had not done the
                            latter because it believed that the prospects of understanding were
                            better on the basis of the situation existing now and in the near
                            future.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then strongly emphasized that it was important to be clear
                            as to what was the heart of the matter here. He stated that the United
                            States was in no sense prisoner of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss>; in other words, it was not merely following with
                            reluctance the lead from someone it was not responsible for. What we
                            were concerned with here were the vital interests of the United States.
                            The Secretary said he assumed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> acted on the same basis in his relations with
                            East Germany, and stressed again that what we were talking about was US
                            national interests.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then referred to some points discussed over the past weeks.
                            He expressed the belief that reconciliation of the freedom of access and
                            of what the USSR called the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>, should not <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0077"
                            />present a problem, since similar arrangements were made throughout the
                            world almost every day. With regard to the status of West Berlin, he
                            said that we preferred to refer to Berlin as a whole, but the USSR said
                            that this was not a subject for discussion. As to West Berlin, the
                            United States view was that West Berlin was not part of West Germany. It
                            was a separate territory under our responsibility but free to choose its
                            way of life and establish relations with the outside world. With
                            reference to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                            interest in the question of frontiers, the Secretary stated that this
                            should not present a great problem either. He reiterated most
                            emphatically that the US was in Berlin and that it will stay there, and
                            stated that it will be well if this was clearly understood. The United
                            States would stay in Berlin until there was a broad change, such as an
                            all-German settlement, a general settlement of East-West relations or a
                            general settlement in the disarmament field. However, under present
                            circumstances, the US would stay in West Berlin. As to the Soviet Union
                            suggestion that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops be stationed in
                            West Berlin, the Secretary said that if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> meant US, UK and French troops, we might go so
                            far as to think about it. Otherwise, such an arrangement would not be
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the heart of
                            the matter was whether the two sides wished to negotiate seriously or to
                            procrastinate. The USSR proceeded on the premise that both sides desired
                            to reach real understanding. The US had referred to difficulties with
                            some of its allies. This was something for the United States to judge,
                            but the USSR was negotiating with the US as the representative of the
                            West, since it knew that the US had influence with its allies. The USSR
                            had been negotiating with the US most seriously; otherwise it would not
                            have displayed such scrupulous and tolerant attitude throughout all the
                            exchanges since Vienna. As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> has stated to the President, Germany was the
                            only source of friction between the United States and the USSR, and if
                            that source were eliminated everybody would sigh with relief.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued that he was
                            gratified that the Secretary believed it possible to reconcile the two
                            requirements related to access. Since the USSR also believed in that
                            possibility, a mutually acceptable solution should be feasible. On the
                            other hand, the question was to what kind of West Berlin access should
                            lead. [sic] The USSR categorically refused to accept the United States
                            proposition that the Western presence should be continued and that no
                            change should be introduced. He contended that while earlier the US had
                            stated that access was the main problem, now that a possibility of
                            resolving that problem had emerged the US stated that there should be no
                            change in West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary interjected that this was nothing new. As the President had
                            stated to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, we
                            could not accept any diminution of the Western position in Berlin.</p>
                        <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0078"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> went on to say that US
                            statements to the effect that the West was present in West Berlin to
                            protect the interests, and what it called the way of life of West
                            Berlin, ignored Soviet statements that the USSR was also in favor of
                            such protection. He contended that the Secretary was now circumventing
                            this element of the Soviet position completely, whereas in New York he
                            had asked questions on how West Berlin’s freedom would be ensured. He
                            said that judging from the Secretary’s statements, the US did not
                            appreciate the steps the Soviet Union had made to narrow the gap between
                            the respective positions of the two sides and toward reaching an
                            understanding. He cited the Soviet paper of March 19 as one of such
                            steps, and asserted that it took into account some of the considerations
                            expressed by the US and general principles mentioned by the Secretary.
                            He said that it was good to hear that the Secretary believed that there
                            was no problem with regards to frontiers and some other matters, and
                            this was a positive factor. The Soviet paper of March 19 had been
                            advanced in order to narrow the gap between the position of the two
                            sides; however, the Secretary had now said that this proposal was almost
                            a step backward. He expressed the hope that the United States would
                            study the paper most carefully and give a reply to it.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the question of access, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> noted that the US had repeatedly stated that it
                            was not clear how access would be organized in practice, and how respect
                            for the sovereignty of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> should be
                            understood in connection with the transit of persons and goods. He
                            contended that the Soviet position on this score had been explained in
                            Vienna, New York and Washington, as well as to Spaak, Fanfani, and some
                            American journalists who must have informed the US Government.
                            Nevertheless, the US appeared still not to have a completely clear
                            picture of how this problem would be handled in practice. Taking into
                            account all this, and in particular the private talks the Secretary and
                            he, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, had last week and
                            the day before, the Soviet delegation had considered the matter and had
                            decided that it would be useful to provide the United States with
                            additional clarification with regard to access and transit so that
                            nothing would remain unclear. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> then produced a paper saying it was a working
                            paper which he hoped the US would study.<note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2">A
                                copy of this paper, which comprised 10 numbered paragraphs on

                        <p>The Secretary responded that he first wished to comment on the paper
                            received the day before. He stated that he was quite sure that if that
                            paper were referred to the United States and allied governments they
                            would have a negative impression of the paper. Therefore, he did not <pb
                                n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0079"/>believe it useful to treat the
                            paper as a formal expression of Soviet views. He said that in terms of
                            the discussion in Geneva, he was inclined to suggest to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to take the paper back, but was
                            not doing so because that would have a connotation in diplomatic
                            practice which he did not intend. The Secretary expressed the view that
                            flexibility should be maintained in these contacts until both moved
                            toward agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then raised the question of how both sides should proceed
                            further. He reiterated emphatically that when the President had stated
                            that our vital interests included: (1) our presence in West Berlin; (2)
                            freedom of access as it had been understood for many years; and (3)
                            freedom of West Berlin to choose its own way of life, he used the word
                            “vital” in its literal sense. The Secretary then suggested that the time
                            had come when exchange of unilateral papers was not nearly as important
                            as discussion of vital interests as seen by each of the two sides and
                            represented by them here and as the search for reconciliation of those
                            interests if possible. He observed that this was the real task of
                            foreign ministers. He then suggested that perhaps starting Thursday as
                            much time as possible be devoted to that purpose, leaving Wednesday for
                            whatever communications either side might need with its government. He
                            stated that the President was anxious for him to come back from Geneva
                            with an idea of how the world would proceed from here, and remarked that
                            he was not sure that the situation had been considered in all of its
                            ramifications. Referring to the Soviet paper of today, the Secretary
                            stated that he was inclined not to receive it unless he had some
                            indication as to its contents, because he did not see any value in
                            exchanging papers which could not serve as a basis for agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that he wished to emphasize one point. Over 200
                            million people live in the USSR and about 180 million in the US. The
                            question was how we should relate these interests to the broad interests
                            of our people. In the framework of the broad interests of our peoples,
                            these problems were peripheral. However, some of these marginal problems
                            may become central overnight. This was not a matter of logic of one side
                            because the other side may not follow the same logic. Both sides must
                            reconcile their interests and prevent a clash which would create danger.
                            The Secretary observed that, in terms of history, the problem discussed
                            here was not such as it was now being built up. Nevertheless, both sides
                            must see how to reconcile their respective interests involved.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wondered whether he
                            had understood the Secretary correctly that he was not interested in the
                            Soviet views on access. He noted that if the Secretary was concerned
                            about the form of the document, he should take note of the fact that it
                            was only a working paper.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed the view that both sides while in Geneva had an
                            opportunity of finding out their respective views. If papers were <pb
                                n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0080"/>exchanged a procedure would be
                            instituted which would be more formal than it was wise under the
                            circumstances. He stated that we were of course interested in Soviet
                            views, but suggested that caution with regard to papers was in order. If
                            the latest Soviet paper was of a personal nature, he might perhaps read
                            it and return it with annotations; however, he did not wish to receive
                            at this point more formal papers involving his and other governments. In
                            other words, the Secretary said he was concerned about the procedure
                            leading toward a solution and not a procedure that would inflame the
                            situation further. Over the past three years, too much literature had
                            been exchanged and too little agreement had been reached.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that if the
                            Secretary had difficulties from the standpoint of formal procedure, he
                            could give the paper to the Secretary on a personal basis or read it to
                            him.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired about the length of the paper. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied it was 3–1/2 pages
                            long.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then suggested that perhaps Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> and himself might designate their associates to
                            look at the paper. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            declined the suggestion, saying that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName> was the Secretary of State and he the Foreign
                            Minister and that it was they who should handle this matter.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then agreed to receive the paper as a working paper given
                            to him by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on a
                            personal basis. He noted that if the paper contained no basis for
                            discussion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> might
                            consider it as not having been given.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> reiterated that the
                            paper was merely a working paper and was not an aide-memoire or a formal
                            note.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the Secretary’s remark on the number of people living in the
                            USSR and the United States and their interests, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> professed surprise at the trend
                            of that remark, which he claimed implied that the USSR wanted to pocket
                            West Berlin. He asserted that the USSR had no need for West Berlin,
                            which was populated by only 2,200,000 people. The USSR only wished a
                            peace treaty and a solution of the West Berlin problem on the basis of
                            such a treaty. The USSR sincerely wished an understanding with the
                            United States in this respect.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary interjected that he had not meant to imply what Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had just referred to,
                            but had merely wished to state that the two governments had a
                            responsibility for their peoples and must consider their interests in
                            the world. He also noted that he did not wish to imply anything with
                            regard to the balance of power.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued by asserting
                            that a solution of the question of a German peace treaty would be in the
                            interest of both sides and in the interest of peace in Europe. The
                            Soviet Union had told the US its ideas <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59"
                                facs="0081"/>with regard to a possible solution of that problem. It
                            had also stated its preference for a solution on the basis of agreement
                            with US. Likewise, the Soviet Union had expressed readiness to sign a
                            peace treaty without Western participation but with an understanding
                            with the West with regard to such matters as frontiers, etc. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> reiterated that he
                            categorically rejected attempts to portray the situation as if the
                            Soviet Union or the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> wished to get
                            hold of West Berlin. With regard to the Secretary’s suggestion for
                            further discussion on Thursday, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> wondered what significance should be attached to
                            that date, asserted that he was prepared to negotiate Wednesday,
                            Thursday or any other day. He said that he might be mistaken but he was
                            under the impression that the Secretary wished to communicate with his
                            Government and that thereupon he would be prepared to engage in more
                            detailed negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that there was no magic about Thursday but noted
                            that the conference schedule and other engagements would not make it
                            possible to meet the following day. He stressed, however, that he was
                            prepared to continue the discussion even tonight. The Secretary then
                            observed that he had planned to stay in Geneva about 10 days. Although
                            he had some important appointments in Washington, if profitable
                            discussions should develop he would be prepared to stay as long as
                            necessary because this was the most important point on the agenda and
                            also one of the most important aspects of disarmament among other
                            things. He wondered whether Thursday afternoon would be a convenient
                            time for a further meeting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that he was
                            available for further discussions at any time while in Geneva. He
                            observed that the Secretary’s departure date was something for the
                            Secretary to decide. Referring to the Secretary’s previous remarks, he
                            contended that the Secretary had implied that he did not regard the
                            question of a peace treaty and of West Berlin as very important. The
                            USSR could not agree with such a view. He said he wished to reiterate
                            what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had said to
                            the President in Vienna, namely, that the USSR regarded this problem as
                            the most acute and extremely crucial one. He contended that in speaking
                            of the German problem the Secretary and other US officials sometimes
                            seem to use words and formulations lightly. Conversely, the USSR had
                            been displaying a more serious attitude and weighed its words.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stressed that he did not wish that there be any
                            misunderstanding on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                            part. He reiterated that Western presence in West Berlin, the freedom of
                            access to West Berlin, and West Berlin’s freedom to choose its own way
                            of life were vital interests of the United States and of the West, and
                            emphasized that the word “vital” meant life or death. He said that he
                            did not wish to minimize the importance of this problem but only to
                            place it in the context of the broader <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60"
                                facs="0082"/>interests of our peoples and to point out the necessity
                            of resolving the problem without conflict. He stated that the two
                            governments should not engage in a dangerous game on top of the roof of
                            a house in which millions of people were going about their daily work.
                            There must be no such dangerous game because this was the matter of our
                            vital interest which we intended to treat as such.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> contended that if
                            there was anybody engaged in such a game, it was not the USSR. The USSR
                            approached the problem with all seriousness and responsibility. However,
                            it believed that this was the area where the interests of the two sides
                            collided most acutely and that therefore, the situation required
                            solution. Although there were some other areas, such as Laos, where
                            settlement was still outstanding, those were areas where the interests
                            of the two sides did not actually collide. He reiterated his assertion
                            that the USSR approached this problem most seriously; it could be
                            noticed that the other side approached it lightly and indulged in strong
                            words.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he did not quite understand the meaning of the
                            word “lightly”. He observed that perhaps there was a misunderstanding in
                            Moscow. For three years the USSR had been making proposals to which the
                            United States and the West had said “NO”. This was not light and neither
                            was the President’s July 25 speech light.<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">For

                            emphasized that it would be a serious mistake if anyone in Moscow
                            believed that the US was joking in this matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> responded that this
                            was exactly what he had in mind. It was a mistake to believe that the
                            use of strong words by US military or civilians sufficed to change the
                            position of the USSR. It was this that he called approaching the problem
                            lightly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then reiterated that
                            the USSR’s choice number 1 was to resolve the problem on the basis of
                            agreement with the West and that the Soviet Union would act without the
                            West only if no such agreement were reached. He asserted that the USSR
                            had come to Geneva in the hope that something could be done to bring the
                            positions of the two sides closer together. The US had said that it was
                            prepared to continue the discussions; the USSR was also prepared and
                            therefore we should see what results could be achieved.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that with regard to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>’s remark he wished to point out that in a real

                        <p>It was agreed that the next meeting would take place at 3:00 p.m. on

                        <p>The Secretary opened the conversation by saying that so much had been
                            said by the two governments on Germany and Berlin at Vienna and since
                            then that it was not easy to know where to turn now. He recalled Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement that the
                            Soviet proposals were not directed against the United States and were
                            not designed to reduce the Western position in Berlin. While not wishing
                            to talk about the intentions of the other party, the Secretary stated
                            the US believed that the objective results of the Soviet proposals at
                            Vienna and since then would indeed greatly reduce or at least limit the
                            Western position in Berlin. He emphasized that it was the objective
                            results we were most concerned about. The Secretary referred to the
                            President’s statement at Vienna that the effect of the Soviet proposals
                            would be very far-reaching and negative not only in Berlin and Germany
                            but also throughout the world. He stressed that we had commitments and
                            responsibilities in Berlin and Germany and that they were fundamental to
                            us. In the light of what we believed the direct and immediate effect of
                            the Soviet proposals would be if we agreed to them, the US could not
                            agree that those proposals would be beneficial to it, as Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had contended. The United
                            States had to look at its position and its interests. It had defined its
                            vital interests and believed that the effect of the Soviet proposals,
                            including some elaboration thereof in Geneva, would injure them deeply.
                            For example, the presence of the West and its forces in West Berlin was
                            of vital interest to us, but the Soviet Union had stated that they must
                            be withdrawn or share their responsibility with Soviet troops.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question of access, the Secretary recalled his earlier
                            statement that if our vital interests were recognized there would be no
                            problem making access arrangements compatible with what the Soviet <pb
                                n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0084"/>Union called respect for the
                            sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. However, the
                            Soviet paper on access<note n="1" xml:id="d19fn1">See <ref
                                    target="#d18fn2">footnote 2, Document 18</ref>.</note> indicated
                            that there was apparently some misunderstanding on the Soviet part. The
                            Secretary stated he had not meant that access should be subject to East
                            Germans but that it could be compatible with the complete management of
                            East German affairs by local authorities.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the question of the viability of West Berlin and the
                            maintenance of its way of life, the Secretary stated that it was clear
                            to us that the objective of the Soviet proposals was to undermine and
                            destroy the freedom of West Berlin. This was implied not only in Soviet
                            statements with regard to access, but also in those regarding the
                            freedom of persons to travel to and from Berlin, as well as regarding
                            West Berlin’s relations with the outside world, particularly West
                            Germany. Thus the Soviet proposals did not provide for the maintenance
                            of the freedom of West Berlin for any period of time.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued by emphasizing that we of necessity must think
                            very hard of the objective effect of the various proposals. The
                            suggestion that a line be drawn under World War II sounded very good.
                            However, when it turned out to be a reduction or even elimination of the
                            Western position in West Berlin it was another matter. Some other
                            phrases in Soviet proposals implied that they also would have a similar
                            effect on the Western position. In the light of all this, the Secretary
                            suggested that perhaps possible alternatives should be examined. The
                            first alternative would be to do nothing. The second alternative would
                            be to allow a dangerous crisis to develop. The third alternative would
                            be to continue efforts along the lines of the efforts conducted so far
                            and to see whether agreement was possible. Finally, the fourth
                            alternative would be to look at the wide gap between the positions of
                            the two sides, recognize that it was very difficult to reach agreement,
                            and see how disagreement should be handled. Commenting on these
                            alternatives, the Secretary stated that, although he believed that
                            neither the Soviet Union nor the United States would shirk a crisis, he
                            was confident that both recognized that a crisis was not in their
                            interests. On the other hand, efforts to find agreement had not been
                            productive thus far and it was difficult to say now whether they would
                            be productive in the future. As to the question of how to handle
                            disagreement, the problem was to find a method not involving the
                            interests of the West or requiring a formal withdrawal of Soviet
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> contended he regretted
                            very much that negotiations had so far been unsuccessful. He claimed
                            that in spite of the fact that the Soviet Union had made certain
                            proposals designed to facilitate agreement, <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63"
                                facs="0085"/>the United States Government appeared not to be serious
                            in its intention to strive for an understanding. Referring to the
                            Secretary’s statement that the Soviet proposals were objectively aimed
                            at undermining the Western and, in particular, the United States
                            position in Berlin, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            asserted that the Soviet Government had believed and continued to
                            believe that the solution of the problem of a German peace treaty and
                            the settlement of the West Berlin situation on the basis of such a
                            treaty would not lead to the undermining of the Western or US position,
                            if that position was correctly understood. He recalled his statement
                            that the United States should not fear anything from the implementation
                            of the Soviet proposals if the United States was genuinely desirous of
                            achieving a detente and of strengthening peace. Thus, he contended, if
                            the interests of the big powers were understood correctly, the Soviet
                            proposals would not lead to the undermining of the positions of any
                            power, including the US. Moreover, the Soviet Union believed that a
                            settlement on the basis of the Soviet proposals would be beneficial to
                            all concerned and would be in the interest of peace. The Soviet Union
                            did not believe that withdrawal of Western forces from West Berlin and a
                            settlement of the question of a free city of West Berlin on the basis of
                            a peace treaty would in any way diminish the position of the Western
                            powers; on the contrary, their position in Europe and throughout the
                            world would be strengthened because that would be a major act by the
                            Western powers to contribute to a relaxation of tensions and to the
                            strengthening of peace. On the other hand, if the US proceeded from the
                            premise that the situation should remain unchanged, i.e., that the
                            occupation regime in West Berlin should remain as if nothing had
                            happened since World War II, that the situation with regard to
                            communications where the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> was being ignored should continue, and that there
                            should be no peace treaty, then it must be stated categorically that the
                            USSR would never agree to that. The USSR believed that changes were
                            needed and it would be very good if an understanding were reached on
                            those changes and if the changes were implemented on an agreed
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then recalled the
                            Secretary’s remarks that it was possible to make freedom of access
                            compatible with what the USSR called respect for the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty. He asserted that the USSR
                            also believed this to be possible, but wondered what content the
                            Secretary injected in his remarks. When the USSR said that there should
                            be respect for the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>, it meant that such respect should be in deeds and not
                            words. However, the Secretary appeared to inject a different content
                            because he qualified his statement by saying there would be no
                            interference in East German internal affairs, thus implying that
                            questions of access were not related to the sovereignty of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. If this interpretation of the
                            Secretary’s position was correct, then the US conception <pb n="64"
                                xml:id="pg_64" facs="0086"/>differed completely from the Soviet
                            conception. In any event, the US position was not quite clear.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued by asserting
                            that the USSR had given the US, both in Moscow and Geneva, clarification
                            as to its understanding of all these problems, starting with the crucial
                            problem of a German peace treaty and down to the problem of transit
                            through the territory of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The
                            USSR had given the US detailed views on these matters, including two
                                papers<note n="2" xml:id="d19fn2">Regarding these Soviet papers, see
                                    <ref target="#d17fn2">footnote 2, Document 17</ref>, and <ref
                                    target="#d18fn2">footnote 2, Document 18</ref>.</note> here in
                            Geneva. The USSR had done so in the hope that the US would duly
                            appreciate it and believing that clarification would facilitate
                            understanding. However, the Secretary’s remarks seemed to indicate that
                            the US failed to see the main point in the Soviet proposals, because the
                            Secretary had implied that something like a blockade would be
                            established around West Berlin as a result of Soviet proposals. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> contended that the
                            USSR had no such intention either with respect to the movement of
                            freight or to the movement of persons. All the USSR called for was such
                            respect for the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            as was accorded to all states through the territory and air space of
                            which transit took place. Therefore the US should not look in the Soviet
                            proposals for what was not there and what the USSR did not intend to
                            include.</p>
                        <p>Commenting on the Secretary’s alternatives, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asserted that he did not know
                            why the Secretary had mentioned the first alternative. He said that
                            there was no question of leaving the situation without change. The
                            United States knew full well that the USSR, together with some other
                            states, would sign a peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> and any attempt by the US to convince the USSR to leave
                            the situation unchanged, i.e., to put the matter of a peace treaty
                            aside, would be futile. Referring to the Secretary’s second alternative,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated that if the US
                            and its allies moved toward crisis, evidently a crisis would be
                            precipitated, but it would be the responsibility of the Western Powers.
                            With regard to the Secretary’s third and fourth alternatives, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> claimed that the
                            distinction between the two was artificial and that they were
                            practically the same. He said that both sides should see where they were
                            close and what separated them. For its part, the USSR was prepared to
                            seek a possibility of understanding and this was attested to by its
                            patience in negotiations. If such readiness also existed on the other
                            side, mutual efforts should be continued. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said that, if he had
                            understood the Secretary correctly, the Secretary appeared to have
                            mentioned at the end of his remarks the possibility of the Soviet
                            Union’s withdrawing its proposals. He said that if the Secretary was
                                joking,<pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0087"/> then of course he
                            could understand that remark; on the other hand, if the Secretary was
                            serious, he could not possibly understand it. In any event, the correct
                            assumption was that the Soviet would not withdraw its proposals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then asserted that the
                            USSR was concerned about whether the United States Government believed,
                            as the Soviet Government did, that it was best to seek an understanding
                            on an agreed basis. If the United States did not wish to proceed on the
                            basis of agreement, then the situation was quite different. However, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said, he accepted the
                            Secretary’s statement that it would be good to agree and to avoid
                            complications between our two states. He said that he agreed with the
                            Secretary’s remarks that both countries had a great deal of work to do
                            at home, and that Germany should not make them enemies. He wondered why
                            then the United States took a position which was not facilitating
                            agreement and why it was looking for devious schemes and motives in
                            Soviet proposals. He reiterated his previous contention that neither the
                            USSR nor the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> needed West Berlin and
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was making a sacrifice by
                            agreeing to the creation of a free city of West Berlin on its territory.
                            He called upon the United States to adopt a more sober position with
                            regard to the Soviet proposals and the Soviet steps to meet the US half
                            way. He observed that it was not useful to stay in place and that this
                            was not the purpose of the USSR in Geneva. Of course, to stay put was
                            better than to go backwards, but it was worse than to move toward
                            understanding.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized that the President desired a solution of this
                            and other problems on the basis of agreement. However, this was not
                            possible by simply accepting Soviet proposals, particularly such
                            proposals as cut at the heart of the interests of the West and of the
                            US.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed the hope that agreement could be reached on the
                            basis of understanding and that the Soviet Union also desired
                            understanding. This had been discussed in Vienna and there was no doubt
                            as to the US position on this point. The Secretary also emphasized that
                            he had no inclination to delve into Soviet motives; what we were
                            concerned about were the objective effects of Soviet proposals, and
                            those effects we must consider very seriously.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the so-called respect for the sovereignty of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, the Secretary stated that he wished to
                            remind Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> of the US view
                            that, under the circumstances prevailing at the end of World War II and
                            since then, no one was in a position to create sovereignty in East
                            Germany which would have priority over our position in West Berlin and
                            our rights of access. He emphasized strongly that this was not in the
                            hands of the Soviet Union, whose position and interests in Germany <pb
                                n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0088"/>stemmed from the same fact and
                            stood on the same basis as our position and interests did, namely, the
                            surrender of Nazi Germany.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then recalled the US suggestion for an international access
                            authority and stated that it had been made because we believed this was
                            one way of reconciling freedom of access with East Germany’s concern for
                            its internal affairs. Noting that the international access authority
                            would involve territories under three jurisdictions—the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, East Germany, and West Berlin—the
                            Secretary stated there would be very simple arrangements with regard to
                            jurisdiction to be accepted by the three government authorities. He
                            observed that the very acceptance of such arrangements would be
                            compatible with the notion of sovereignty and that there would be no
                            interference with the day-by-day activities in the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, West Berlin, or East Germany. The
                            Secretary then stressed that an international authority such as
                            conceived by the US would be quite different from an authority under the
                            administrative arrangements by East Germans and subject to a four-power
                            commission which would probably operate under the rule of unanimity,
                            although the Soviet proposal contained no specific reference to such
                            rule. Such an arrangement would expose access to all the hazards to
                            which <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> might wish to
                            subject it. There was no assurance that the four-power commission could
                            resolve any problems that might arise. Although we were prepared to work
                            on this and see whether it perhaps provided some possibility, we did not
                            see in this arrangement adequate guarantees for West Berlin’s future.
                            Furthermore, the Soviet paper indicated that the establishment of an
                            access authority was related to the withdrawal of Western forces from
                            West Berlin, and this was of course a major obstacle from our
                            standpoint. The Secretary then noted that the United States had never
                            held the view that East Germany would not have a normal and active part
                            in the provision of access facilities, such as rail, Autobahn, canals,
                            and in the air. The latter would involve only the question of
                            overflights. The Secretary said that exclusion of the East Germans in
                            these matters would be impractical and unnecessary.</p>
                        <p>Turning to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s comments
                            on the alternatives he had indicated, the Secretary stated that he
                            wished to stress most emphatically what the President had told Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> in Vienna, namely,
                            that it was not the US who was pressing this problem to a crisis. It was
                            not the United States who had brought up the problem in its present form
                            and therefore we could not accept the responsibility. As to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s comment that the
                            distinction between the third and fourth alternatives rested on weak
                            ground, the Secretary said that he wished to illustrate his point. Thus
                            far we had apparently been working on the third alternative. There was
                            no need to assume that the alternative was necessarily at a close,
                            although it had not yielded much result. However, there was no agreement
                            in sight today; nor was there a basis for agreement. Nevertheless, <pb
                                n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0089"/>both sides must seek to resolve
                            the problem. It was in the light of this that the possibility had been
                            suggested to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> of
                            reaching agreement on certain simple and short principles, some of which
                            our two governments had already agreed to quite recently, in any case
                            more recently than at the end of World War II. If the heads of
                            governments of our countries could agree on those principles, each
                            principle would open the way for additional negotiations. There would
                            also be stipulation as to what would happen in the meantime. The
                            Secretary said that since Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> might not have obtained a clear picture of this
                            idea when it was first mentioned to him, he had prepared a paper<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d19fn3"><ref target="#d20">Document 20</ref>.</note>
                            which would clarify what was meant. The paper covered several subjects
                            of interest to both the US and the USSR. The Secretary then handed the
                            paper to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, noting that
                            it was being given as a working paper within the framework of personal
                            conversation. He pointed out that the contents of the paper did not
                            require confirmation by the USSR of Western occupation rights in West
                            Berlin, rights which we believed needed no confirmation. The contents of
                            the paper did not stand in the way of a peace treaty but provided for a
                            framework where a peace treaty with East Germany would not inflame the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he wished to make
                            a few observations. Reverting to the question of access authority, he
                            wondered why the Secretary had mentioned three jurisdictions. He
                            professed that he could not understand the reason for mentioning the
                            West German jurisdiction. He asserted that the question was that of the
                            sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, but the US was
                            trying to involve the jurisdiction of West Germany despite the fact that
                            the Secretary himself had correctly stated that West Berlin was not
                            related to West Germany.</p>
                        <p>As to the question of a peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            recalled US statements to the effect that it was up to the USSR whether
                            to sign such a treaty or not. However, he wished it to be clearly
                            understood that the USSR did not regard the conclusion of a peace treaty
                            with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> merely as a formal act, but
                            rather as a major political act which must be accompanied by certain
                            changes, by certain measures, and by the solution of certain questions
                            the USSR had repeatedly mentioned to the Western Powers. It would be one
                            thing if the USSR signed a peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> with prior understanding regarding the solution of
                            other questions with the US and apparently its allies as well. Then
                            everything would go smoothly. On the other hand, as the USSR had
                            repeatedly stated, if there were no such understanding, the situation
                            would be quite different. The US had stated on many occasions that when
                            the Soviet Union signed a peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>, there should <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0090"/>be
                            a prior understanding as to what the situation would be and what
                            measures should accompany such a treaty. The USSR agreed with this and
                            this is why it was negotiating. It would be well if agreement could be
                            found.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the Secretary’s remark that it was not quite clear how
                            decisions would be taken in the four-power commission of the access
                            authority, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated
                            that there were of course certain aspects which would have to be
                            resolved through additional consideration and discussion. However, he
                            thought that in principle it was quite clear that the objective of that
                            proposal was to facilitate agreement with regard to access and the
                            status of West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>As to the paper given to him by the Secretary, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he was prepared to
                            consider it as a working paper, just as the two Soviet documents were
                            working papers, but wished to inquire whether the paper had been
                            prepared with due account being taken of the two Soviet documents. He
                            asserted that this was of substantial importance because the Soviet
                            papers had been drafted with the objective of facilitating agreement. He
                            said that he would have comments on the US paper at a later date and
                            facetiously asked what he should tell to his allies now that he had
                            received a US paper.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that this was up to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> himself. He said that his paper was not in
                            direct response to the two Soviet papers. It was an illustration of the
                            approach he had mentioned at his first meeting with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. The Secretary also observed
                            that we could of course discuss access, perhaps within the context of
                            the Soviet papers, but stressed that the linkage to the withdrawal of
                            Western troops created a formidable problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> observed that there
                            was not much point in exchanging papers unless account was being taken
                            of their respective contents.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary reiterated that his paper was not in response to the Soviet
                            papers but was rather in the context of earlier discussions. Noting that
                            he had already made some observations on the two Soviet papers, the
                            Secretary wondered whether it might perhaps be profitable if some of his
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s associates
                            discussed them further, although he would be prepared to do that
                            personally with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. He
                            said that a number of points required clarification, such as, for
                            instance, the question of the unanimity rule in the access authority, if
                            we were fully to understand the Soviet papers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that either
                            procedure was acceptable. Reverting to the question of access authority,
                            he emphasized that the Soviet proposal was linked to the withdrawal of
                            Western forces from West Berlin and their replacement with neutral or
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops. The Soviet proposal <pb
                                n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0091"/>for access authority could be
                            considered only in that context, because it was not a separate
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that this was how we understood the Soviet proposal
                            and that in that sense it did not advance us very far. He strongly
                            emphasized that the presence of Western forces in West Berlin was
                            fundamental to us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> responded that if this
                            was fundamental to the US, the USSR also believed that it was one of
                            several fundamental questions, such as the question of a peace treaty,
                            which was primary and decisive, the question of respect for the
                            sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, the question of
                            the status of a free city of West Berlin, etc.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded the conversation by recalling his statement that
                            many problems would fall into place if the central questions were
                            resolved.</p>

                            First, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> shows no
                            inclination to break off talks and register an impasse. Despite several

                            not respond with belligerence or threats. Second, there seems to be no
                            movement in Soviet position toward Western vital interests. He made it
                            perfectly clear that minor variations in access proposals he had
                            submitted were organically dependent upon removal Western forces from
                            West Berlin.</p>

                                >Gromyko</persName> indicated some interest in “modus vivendi” paper

                            such as status of West Berlin had been omitted. I told him that we could
                            discuss such questions. We agreed our respective colleagues might have
                            preliminary discussion at technical level of his two recent papers and
                            our paper before our next conversation. (This being arranged.)</p>
                        <p>There is no doubt that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            understands conditions under which, from our point of view, they could
                            sign peace treaty with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> without
                            precipitating crisis. He again stated clearly, however, that they are
                            not interested in a peace treaty as pure formality but one which would
                            either be based upon a prior agreement with West or one which would
                            carry with it full implications of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            sovereignty with respect to access and other questions.</p>
                        <p>I am aware that you hoped that conversations with <persName

                            moving toward a crisis or toward a possible agreement. Nothing has been
                            said at Geneva which indicates that we are moving toward an agreement.
                            Whether this means we are moving toward a crisis is still obscure. Fact
                            that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> seems interested in
                            continuation talks is at least relevant. Suggest intelligence community
                            be specially alerted for other evidence of Soviet intentions.<note n="3"

                                >Clay</persName>. While the tightening of the rope around our neck
                            in West Berlin has never stopped, the rate was accelerated with the air
                            corridor harassments which began in early February prior to Geneva. The
                            shooting of member of British Military Mission and shooting at car of
                            member of our Mission which could have resulted in wounding or murder of
                            occupant cannot be considered as separate isolated events but as a part
                            of a pattern. Delays in clearing convoys, demands to search trucks,
                            continued tailings in East Berlin all fit into this pattern. Also, visa
                            charge tried out as test marks the initial inclusion of West German
                            traffic in the pattern. With Geneva further evidence of Soviet
                            intransigence its failure is almost certain to bring the rope still
                            tighter. Notes may be fine for the record, but to stop this pattern we
                            must be much more determined and stronger on the ground and in the air
                            than we have been to date. I am convinced that retaliatory action
                            against Soviet Mission is far more effective than a note and if we are
                            not prepared to protect our own Mission to this degree we should
                            withdraw it.</p>
                        <p>I think too we must be ready if harassment increases to show our strength
                            in the air; to refuse to accept delays on the Autobahn; and to meet each
                            restriction in German traffic with countermeasures of blockade and
                            harassment elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>I hope that I am proved wrong and that we do not have to face increasing
                            pressures. We are not going to stop <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"

                            years of pressure, we have no immediate course of action to meet any
                            challenge. We must get our house in order so that we can move instantly,
                            even if unilaterally, as hesitation and delay can quickly force us into
                            a position where our only choice is war.</p>

                            in their minds between (a) reaching agreement on points of substance and
                            (b) determining how to deal with the fact of disagreement without moving

                            within hours, our present impression is that they do seem to wish to
                            keep things open at Geneva to avoid a break here, possibly with summit
                            in mind. While <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> has not
                            mentioned summit on his initiative, I did remark to him that our modus

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> invited the Secretary
                            to speak first, saying that it was an unwritten tradition in the Soviet
                            Union to have the guest speak first.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished to make one or two preliminary comments. He
                            said that we had not responded initially and immediately to the Soviet
                            paper on access because it was our view that it contained a fatal
                            defect, i.e., the link between access and withdrawal of Western forces
                            from West Berlin. That link was also apparent in what Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said orally. The Secretary
                            emphasized that any proposal contingent on the withdrawal of Western
                            forces was impossible and misleading because of the importance we
                            attached to the presence of Western forces in West Berlin. Referring to
                            the US suggestion for an international access authority and to the
                            Soviet suggestion for such an authority, the Secretary believed that it
                            might be possible to explore this in order to see whether some solution
                            could be found, but emphasized again the greatness of the problem
                            created by the linkage.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that this was an illustration of the fundamental
                            problem in communications between our two governments. The Soviet
                            proposals were obviously in conflict with the vital interests of the
                            West. A series of communications and conversations both sides had had so
                            far on these problems had made it obvious that there was no movement
                            toward agreement. However, it was not in the interests of the two sides
                            merely to say that no agreement was possible and let things develop
                            toward a crisis. Therefore, the US had tried to list the points on which
                            it believed agreement was possible, at least in general terms. If both
                            sides agreed on general principles, they could proceed to discuss other
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that personally he did not believe that there were
                            many points of difference; however, they were points involving vital
                            interests <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0099"/>and if they could be
                            handled and managed, other problems would fall into place. In spite of
                            the differences of emphasis and detail, the Secretary thought agreement
                            should be possible on the questions of the status of West Berlin,
                            boundaries, non-aggression, practical arrangements to reconcile access
                            and what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> called the
                            sovereignty of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and non-diffusion of
                            nuclear weapons. He stressed, however, that the stumbling block was what
                            we considered our vital interests.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the US paper on general principles,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d25fn1"><ref target="#d20">Document 20</ref>.</note> the
                            Secretary said that it was not in direct response to the Soviet papers
                            on principles and access, but was designed for a different purpose.
                            While the Soviet paper on general principles restated Soviet proposals,
                            we believed that account must be taken of the differences existing on
                            the various problems and that we must see how to handle them. Thus our
                            paper did not require withdrawal of Soviet proposals or acknowledgement
                            by the USSR of our vital interests in any new form. On the other hand,
                            our paper contained points on which both sides should be able to agree
                            and which could serve as a basis for further discussions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then launched into a
                            lengthy statement frequently referring to what appeared to be a talking
                            paper. He started out be restating the Soviet Government’s belief that
                            the Soviet proposals for a German peace treaty and the creation of a
                            free city of West Berlin on the basis of such a treaty were aimed at a
                            detente and at an improvement in international relations, particularly
                            those between the great powers. He asserted that the Soviet Government
                            wished good relations with the United States, including friendship, and
                            that the peoples of our two countries would be grateful to their leaders
                            if they were to bring about such relations. He stated that the Soviet
                            Union had rejected and still rejected any attempts to depict the Soviet
                            insistence on a peace treaty and on the creation of a free city of West
                            Berlin as pursuit by the USSR of some narrow aims. The Soviet Government
                            also flatly rejected assertions that the USSR or the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> wish to take hold of West Berlin. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> observed that such
                            aims were alien to Soviet policy. He then said that the Soviet Union was
                            proceeding on the basis of the fact that there was an absolutely
                            abnormal situation in Germany and West Berlin, due to the fact that
                            seventeen years after World War II there was still no peace treaty and
                            the occupation regime continued to exist in West Berlin as if nothing
                            had happened since the war. The Soviet Government believed that this
                            abnormal situation was in conflict with the best interests of peace in
                            Europe and throughout the world and was in conflict with the interests
                            of improving relations among states, including those between the US and
                            the USSR. He contended that the Soviet Government <pb n="78"
                                xml:id="pg_78" facs="0100"/>had never signed and could not sign a
                            commitment providing for a perpetuation of the occupation of Germany or
                            West Berlin, whereas what the Western Powers now sought in West Berlin
                            was tantamount to the occupation of that city for an indefinite period.
                            He reiterated that the Soviet Government could not agree to any such
                            thing. Seventeen years had passed since World War II and a line should
                            be drawn under that war; the drawing of such a line should not be a mere
                            formal act but should involve changes stemming from a peace treaty.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asserted that the
                            Soviet Government proceeded from the facts of the existing situation,
                            where two sovereign and independent German states existed, and suggested
                            that all states must take account of those basic facts in shaping their
                            policy with regard to Germany and, to a large extent, with regard to
                            Europe in general. The Soviet Union proceeded from this basic fact and
                            the purpose of a peace treaty was to bring the situation in Germany and
                            Berlin into accord with the present as distinct from the past.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued that it was
                            most important now to have a German peace treaty and to resolve the
                            status of West Berlin on the basis of such a treaty by agreement of all
                            states concerned. As to the contents of such status, the Soviet
                            Government had made proposals on the subject and they were well known.
                            He said that he wished to emphasize the Soviet Government’s preference
                            for an agreed solution of the problem of a German peace treaty and of
                            the status of West Berlin on the basis of such a treaty. He stressed
                            that the USSR would sign a peace treaty unilaterally and take
                            appropriate steps without agreement on the part of the Western Powers
                            only if the latter refused to reach agreement. However, the USSR
                            preferred an agreed solution and the search for such a solution was the
                            purpose of the present negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then stated that the
                            questions of a German peace treaty and of a free city of West Berlin
                            were closely related to the question of respect for the sovereignty of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He said that the USSR could not
                            accept any agreement not providing for such respect. The Soviet Union
                            could not agree to any arrangements which would be based on a situation
                            where certain states would completely disregard the sovereignty of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> because of their feeling of
                            animosity toward that state. He said that while many countries had a
                            social order and policies which the USSR did not like, the Soviet
                            Government respected their sovereignty in dealing with them, and
                            whenever the Soviet Union had to resolve certain problems with those
                            countries it did so on the basis of respect for their sovereignty. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> should not be an exception from
                            that rule. The Secretary’s statement that unrestricted access and
                            transit of persons and goods could be reconciled with respect for the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>’s sovereignty represented a
                            correct thesis. The Soviet Government held the same view and had said so
                            in New York and to Ambassador <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0101"
                                /><persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> in Moscow.
                            However, the main problem was the content and the interpretation of this
                            formula. He asserted that the Soviet Government feared there was an
                            intention merely to pay lip service to the sovereignty of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and to flout it in practice. If this
                            was the case, it would be regrettable and it would not facilitate
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the Soviet paper on transit, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> claimed that it had been prepared in order to
                            meet repeated US requests that the Soviet Union spell out its views with
                            regard to the question of respect for the sovereignty of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in connection with the transit of
                            persons and goods. He contended that the paper set forth the detailed
                            views of the Soviet Government on the subject of civilian transport, but
                            the US pretended not to have noticed the paper and merely said that its
                            main defect was the link to the Soviet proposals on the status of West
                            Berlin. Although it was true that there was a Soviet proposal on the
                            status, the US now had an opportunity of considering the problem of
                            transit thoroughly and of replying to the Soviet views on transit as
                            such. Of course, transit would be to such a West Berlin the status of
                            which would have to be agreed. However, the Soviet Union had now stated
                            its views on transit and on the question of how sovereignty and transit
                            could be reconciled, as both sides had said that they could.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the question of the presence of Western forces in West
                            Berlin, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the
                            Soviet Government had proposed several variants of the solution of this
                            problem, which were well known. He claimed that the Secretary’s remarks
                            indicated that the West regarded West Berlin only as a military
                            springboard and a military base. The USSR was compelled to draw
                            appropriate conclusions from this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said that the
                            Soviet Government had repeatedly stated its position with regard to the
                            questions to be resolved in connection with a peace treaty, such as
                            borders, non-transfer of nuclear weapons to and non-production of such
                            weapons in the two Germanies, and non-aggression. That position was well
                            known and there was no need to repeat it. The Soviet Union had tried to
                            present its views on these matters in compressed form in the USSR
                            working paper on general principles. Of course, the paper contained
                            certain points which were not regarded favorably by the United States.
                            However, the US paper also included certain points representing US
                            unilateral positions and took no account of Soviet positions.
                            Furthermore, the US paper even represented a backward step in certain
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then reviewed the US
                            paper paragraph by paragraph. With regard to paragraph 1, he said that
                            the title “Berlin” appeared to reflect a desire to slip in the idea of
                            one Berlin, something which was not negotiable. He said the United
                            States itself had admitted that West Berlin was a separate entity and he
                            contended that East Berlin was an organic part of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Referring to the phrase “for improving
                                <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0102"/>the situation” in
                            subparagraph (b), he wondered what it meant. He suggested that it might
                            mean an increase in the number of occupation troops or agreement on a
                            perpetuation of the occupation. He asserted that the real question was
                            that of eliminating the occupation and of removing the situation fraught
                            with dangers and risks; the present situation yielded no good to anyone,
                            including the United States, from the political, military, economic, or
                            any other standpoint. With reference to subparagraph (c), he said it
                            emphasized preservation of the present access procedures whereas the
                            USSR proceeded on the basis of the need for respect for the sovereignty
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and of reconciling the
                            concept of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty with free
                            access. He said it would be intolerable if the sovereignty of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was not respected. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asserted that there was no
                            justification for the US apprehensions with regard to possible actions
                            by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in the event that the Soviet
                            proposal was adopted, because if the USSR reached agreement with the US
                            and its allies, it would consult its own allies, including the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> would undertake appropriate obligations. Therefore,
                            there was no ground for fears. He expressed the hope that the US would
                            study the Soviet proposals on access, including access authority, and
                            duly evaluate them. He reiterated the Soviet desire to reach agreement
                            and said he wished to stress again that only if there were no agreement
                            between the two sides would the West have to deal with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He reiterated that the US should now
                            carefully study the consideration expressed by the USSR.</p>
                        <p>Referring to paragraph 2 of the US Draft Principles, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> noted that subparagraphs (a)
                            and (b) referred to German unification. He said the Soviet Government’s
                            view was that this was an internal matter for the Germans themselves to
                            resolve by agreement between the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and
                            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and asserted that conclusion of
                            a single peace treaty or of two separate peace treaties would facilitate
                            a rapprochement between the two German states. He claimed that this
                            paragraph was an illustration of the incorrectness of the US assertion
                            that the paper set forth agreed views. The Soviet views on the question
                            of German unification were known to the US, but the paper set forth the
                            US’ own views. With reference to subparagraph (c), Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that it was the Soviet
                            view that any agreement with any part of Germany must be consistent with
                            the understanding, including the results of the present negotiations
                            between the two sides on the questions relating to a German peace
                            settlement, if such an understanding was reached. On the other hand, if
                            there were no such understanding, then the USSR would have no
                            alternative other than to act on the basis of a peace treaty with the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. However, that would be the case
                            only in the event that there was no agreement between East and West.</p>
                        <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0103"/>
                        <p>Commenting on paragraph 3, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> contended that it substituted the question of
                            non-armament of the two German states with nuclear weapons and of
                            non-production of such weapons in those states with the question of a
                            much broader, international scope. Yet conversations both here in Geneva
                            and in New York had dealt with this problem with specific reference to
                            the two Germanies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            said that the USSR was not opposed to the idea of preventing the
                            proliferation of nuclear weapons on a global scale and noted that the
                            Soviet vote for the respective <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General
                            Assembly resolution, as well as the Soviet Government’s communication on
                            this question to the acting Secretary General of the United Nations,
                            reflected that attitude. However, for reasons that were well known, it
                            was important that one problem not be replaced with the other or made
                            contingent upon its solution. Moreover, the formula in the US paper was
                            unsatisfactory because it did not preclude such interpretation as would
                            allow armament with nuclear weapons of such Bundeswehr and other
                            non-nuclear nation forces as were formally not under the control of
                            “national governments” but were considered as part of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces. He stated that the language
                            of this paragraph should not allow such interpretation. He noted,
                            however, that the USSR would not object to the inclusion of such a broad
                            formula in the principles, if they were agreed, provided that it
                            contained the phrase “including the two German states.” Furthermore, it
                            must also be understood that the solution of the broad problem must not
                            hold up the application of this principle to the two German states. Of
                            course, if there were no delay with regard to the broad problem, there
                            would be no difficulty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> then stated that the Soviet position was that
                            nuclear weapons should not be transferred either directly, through third
                            parties, or through military organizations; this should apply to both
                            the universal formula and the formula restricted only to the two German
                            states.</p>
                        <p>Turning to paragraph 4 of the US paper, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> said that reference to non-use of force in
                            sub-paragraph (a) was a minimum minimorum. On the other hand, the USSR
                            believed that borders must be legally formalized. The positions of the
                            two sides were also different with regard to the question of demarcation
                            lines, because the USSR did not make any distinction between external
                            borders of and the line between the two Germanies. He contended that it
                            would be in the interest of peace if the internal line were formalized
                            as a border. Noting that so far neither side had proposed either orally
                            or in writing any modus for such formalization, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thought that both sides would
                            have to work out such a modus at a later date. As to sub-paragraph 4
                            (b), Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that a
                            declaration on non-aggression was an acceptable form of obligation from
                            the Soviet standpoint. However, he professed puzzlement in regard to the
                            provision under (ii) and wondered why language causing puzzlement and
                            even apprehension should be included. <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82"
                                facs="0104"/>A non-aggression agreement was a clear commitment
                            involving politico-moral obligations to which nothing should be added
                            that complicated the matter. With respect to sub-paragraph (c), Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the USSR
                            could not accept reference to past statements by the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. He noted that this point related to
                            paragraph 8 in the Soviet draft principles. It was quite evident that
                            the two German states must make some kind of statements. Furthermore, in
                            the spirit of fairness, if reference was made to past statements by the

                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> should also be referred to.</p>
                        <p>Observing that those were the Soviet views on the US working paper, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he wished
                            to point out that, in developing its own proposals, the USSR had
                            attempted to narrow the gap between the US and the Soviet positions. He
                            regretted that the Soviet action had not met with due response on the
                            part of the US and expressed the hope that the US would pay greater
                            attention to the study of Soviet proposals and would find in them what
                            it had not yet been able to discern. Of course, it was possible that the
                            US had already discerned certain points in the Soviet proposals but was
                            unwilling to speak about them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> then claimed that the Soviet basic proposals for
                            a German peace treaty and the solution of the West Berlin situation on
                            the basis of such a treaty, as well as the additional Soviet proposals
                            made here in Geneva in both written and oral form, were designed to
                            facilitate an understanding between the two sides. He said that the main
                            goal was to eliminate the differences between the two sides and to
                            remove the obstacles to agreement between them in Europe, where their
                            interests collided and where dangers existed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he wished to
                            conclude by recalling Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s statement in Vienna that Central Europe,
                            West Berlin, and the question of a German peace treaty and of the status
                            of West Berlin on the basis of such a treaty were the only areas in the
                            world where the US and the USSR interests were in direct collision. If
                            this problem were settled, that would lead to a radical improvement in
                            the relations between our two states and in the situation in Europe
                            generally. In this connection, he also recalled the Secretary’s
                            statement in New York that an improvement in the relations between our
                            two states would be of historic significance.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded by saying that he wished to reciprocate the
                            comments Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had made at
                            the beginning and at the end of his remarks. He stated that the two
                            Governments should try to reach agreement on these problems. Berlin and
                            Germany were undoubtedly the most critical problems and if they were
                            resolved prospects would open for an improvement in the relations
                            between our two states with regard to many other matters. The Secretary
                            felt that it was important that both countries reach agreement on these
                            problems and not let them <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0105"/>affect
                            adversely their relations in other areas, including disarmament, where
                            the US was determined to make every effort to reach positive
                            results.</p>
                        <p>Noting that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had
                            touched upon a great number of points, the Secretary said that he would
                            not deal with all of them in detail, but wished to make certain
                            observations on some of them. The Secretary appreciated Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s detailed comments on the US
                            paper on general principles. However, he wished to emphasize that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was not right in
                            saying that our principles took no account of Soviet positions and even
                            represented a backward step as compared to earlier discussions. In fact,
                            discussions between our two sides over the period of the past months had
                            been taking place in a somewhat one-sided manner which was
                            disadvantageous to the US. The USSR had put forward proposals with
                            regard to what it believed to be the right way of drawing a line under
                            World War II. The United States had also had proposals as to how a line
                            under World War II should be drawn, i.e., by unification through free
                            elections, and with Berlin as the capital of a unified Germany. However,
                            we were not putting those proposals forward because that would mean a
                            mere exchange of proposals without agreement. Rather, we had based
                            ourselves on the factual situation. On the other hand, when under these
                            circumstances the Soviet Union said that a line should be drawn under
                            World War II, it clearly had in mind changes which were to a serious
                            disadvantage to the West. The Secretary observed that this brought him
                            to the key point, i.e., the presence of Western forces in West Berlin.
                            He stressed strongly that the US could not accept the view that there
                            was an anomaly in the presence of Western forces in West Berlin; that
                            was no more abnormal than any other aspect of the situation in Germany.
                            Neither could the US accept the view that lines of influence had been
                            drawn in Germany and that Western presence east of those lines was
                            abnormal. Arrangements had been made at the end of World War II, and
                            they provided for Western presence where it existed today. The Secretary
                            recalled the clear and forceful statement by the President in Vienna
                            with regard to the great effect on the Western position that would take
                            place if we permitted ourselves to be driven out of that area. He
                            observed that he did not say that the USSR intended to drive us out, but
                            noted that the objective effect of the Soviet proposals would be just
                            that. This had also been made clear by the President in Vienna.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that he could not agree that there was
                            ground for fears that West Berlin was a military base. The Western
                            forces in West Berlin were minute in the present military situation.
                            They had minor arms, no nuclear weapons, and insecure communications. No
                            military leader in the East or West would regard West Berlin as a
                            military base. The troops in West Berlin were there exclusively for
                            political <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0106"/>purposes, namely, to
                            stabilize the situation in Germany, and such stabilization worked to the
                            advantage of both the USSR and the US. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> and his colleagues had stated from time to time
                            that the Soviet proposals concerning Berlin were good for the West. The
                            Secretary said that he wished to tell Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> sincerely that the presence of Western forces in
                            West Berlin was good for both the United States and the USSR. However,
                            neither side should tell the other what was good for it; each of them
                            should decide this for itself and then both should talk to each other on
                            that basis.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question of transit, the Secretary noted that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had used the phrases
                            “transit as such” and “transit to such a Berlin the status of which was
                            to be agreed upon”. He also observed that any proposals on transit must
                            not necessarily be linked to the withdrawal of Western forces from West
                            Berlin. As to the compatibility of free access with the so-called
                            sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, the Secretary
                            said this was something both sides had said should be possible, but he
                            was not sure that a common formula had been found for working this
                            problem out. He stated that the expressions “free access” and “exercise
                            of sovereignty” contained the seeds of basic contradiction, unless
                            agreement with respect to free access did not involve the exercise of
                            sovereignty in any manner that would frustrate the agreement. In this
                            connection, the Secretary referred to the first two sentences in
                            paragraph 2 of the Soviet paper on transit and wondered how they could
                            be reconciled. He supposed that both sides would work out a new
                            understanding with regard to access, which would then be subject to
                            agreement by East Germany. The Secretary recalled his remarks that East
                            Germans would of necessity participate in access procedures; however, in
                            a broader sense, the exercise of sovereignty, as far as East Germany was
                            concerned, would consist in agreeing to access. On the other hand, if
                            “sovereignty” meant assumption of control over access in any geographic
                            area, then access would be vulnerable. The United States had proposed an
                            international access authority which it believed could overcome this
                            problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had made a
                            different proposal with regard to such an authority, which would not
                            necessarily overcome that problem. The Soviet proposal assumed disputes
                            and provided for a four-power commission to arbitrate. This, the
                            Secretary noted, also involved the question of whether that commission
                            would act under the unanimity rule. However, the Secretary stated, if
                            transit was not dependent on the withdrawal of Western forces from West
                            Berlin, then he thought that there were some points here which brought
                            the two sides closer together and we could see how to move toward
                            agreement, because he did not believe there was an inherent problem in
                            the matter of reconciling access with the activities of the authorities
                            in East Germany.</p>
                        <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0107"/>
                        <p>Referring to the US paper on principles, the Secretary said he supposed
                            that the general principle under the heading “Berlin” was something both
                            sides had said over the past several months. As to the word
                            “improvement” in sub-paragraph (b), he said there was no basis for
                            suspicion here, because if satisfactory arrangements were found, that
                            would represent improvement; he could not imagine that arrangements
                            agreed upon by both sides would not constitute improvement. As to
                            paragraph 2, the Secretary recalled Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>’s comment that it contained a one-sided
                            formulation. However, the Secretary observed, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would surely recognize that
                            this was basically what both sides had been saying, and had said more
                            formally in 1955,<note n="2" xml:id="d25fn2">Presumably <persName

                            paragraph omitted reference to free elections. The United States agreed
                            that reunification was something for the German people to accomplish;
                            however, we believed that the victorious powers had a residual
                            responsibility for the solution of the German problem. In any event, the
                            language of paragraph 2 was formulated in such a way as to reflect what
                            we believed to be the Soviet position as well.</p>
                        <p>As to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s comments on
                            the question of nuclear diffusion, the Secretary recalled Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement in New York that
                            the two Germanies should not have nuclear weapons and his own statement
                            that this presented no problem because it was our national policy to
                            oppose the proliferation of nuclear weapons to any national government,
                            including the two Germanies. He expressed the view that this problem was
                            something that could be worked out promptly. If there should be any
                            delay because of some difficulties, we could see what could be done, but
                            we preferred the general formula rather than to point at this or that
                            individual state. As to indirect transfer, the Secretary stated we had
                            no intention of giving nuclear weapons to the Bundeswehr or any other
                            national forces, directly or through third parties. He reiterated that
                            the US was opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and said that
                            we had gone to considerable length to safeguard that policy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then recalled the President’s remark to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> to the effect that some
                            questions might be easier to resolve with the passing of time. He said
                            that he wished to note that this did not mean procrastination, because
                            when two sides were in disagreement it was difficult to tell which side
                            was procrastinating in not agreeing with the other. However, many things
                            could happen with time and create a situation where problems would be
                            easier to resolve. For instance, the situation in East Germany had been
                            stabilized in many respects and the <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86"
                                facs="0108"/>flow of refugees had been stopped. Steps could be made
                            in the disarmament field which would create a situation where solution
                            of various problems might be easier. Also, the confrontation in Berlin
                            could be reduced. The Secretary noted that our main problem was that we
                            were dealing here with a dangerous confrontation of interests and
                            particularly with proposals which we believed seriously affected our
                            interests. Both sides should avoid affecting their mutual interests and
                            develop the situation with regard to Berlin on that basis.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then observed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> had made some twenty-five points and that he had
                            not responded to all of them. He said that he wished to study Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s remarks against the
                            background of the previous conversations and then report to the
                            President. He expressed the hope that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> would do the same and said that both sides
                            should see how to move toward agreement on this critical question.
                            Reverting to paragraph 1 of the US draft principles, the Secretary added
                            that reference to “improving the situation in Berlin” related to
                            possible arrangements with regard to traffic, family ties, and other
                            possible improvements affecting both parts of Berlin. He noted that the
                            first part of paragraph 1 referred to West Berlin. The Secretary
                            observed that this wording was not an attempt to conceal an all-Berlin
                            proposal, although the US was prepared to make such a proposal at any
                            moment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he wished to
                            comment on some points made by the Secretary. Referring to the
                            Secretary’s remark with regard to the link between access and the status
                            of West Berlin, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said
                            that there was indeed such a link in the Soviet proposals. He said that
                            transit arrangements would be superimposed on an agreed status of West
                            Berlin and noted that the Soviet proposals with regard to transit did
                            not exist outside such an agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then expressed
                            satisfaction at the Secretary’s remark that there were some points of a
                            positive nature in the Soviet paper on access. As to the question of the
                            voting procedure in the proposed four-power commission, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated that this was a subject
                            for later discussion and that he did not wish to commit himself now.
                            However, he believed that the voting procedure should be such as to
                            satisfy all parties and at the same time not be in conflict with the
                            sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. As to the
                            purpose of the international authority, he viewed that authority as
                            arbiter acting in situations such as those discussed in Geneva in
                                1959.<note n="3" xml:id="d25fn3">For documentation on the Geneva

                        <p>Referring to the Secretary’s comment on the first two sentences in
                            paragraph 2 of the Soviet paper on transit, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that if <pb n="87"
                                xml:id="pg_87" facs="0109"/>there were no contradictions there would
                            be no problem. He contended that such contradictions exited whenever
                            international obligations were assumed: while one party must abide by
                            its obligations the other party must respect its sovereignty. This was
                            nothing new and was not an insoluble problem. In fact, the US itself,
                            through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>, had
                            referred to international agreements, in particular the Chicago
                                Convention.<note n="4" xml:id="d25fn4">For text of the Convention on
                                International Civil Aviation, signed at Chicago on December 7, 1944,

                                >Gromyko</persName> said he was happy to hear the Secretary say that
                            such arrangements were made on a daily basis. He went on to say that it
                            was inconceivable to imagine a situation where the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would take control over access in the
                            face of such obligations as it would have assumed with regard to access
                            arrangements, including international authority. Thus the Secretary’s
                            fears were not justified.</p>
                        <p>As to the duration of an agreement on transit, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the USSR proceeded on
                            the basis that if there was agreement on the status of West Berlin,
                            civilian transit arrangements would remain in force for the duration of
                            the status.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question of nuclear diffusion, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he thought the Secretary
                            apparently understood the difference between the two variants and the
                            Soviet apprehensions in this matter. He reiterated that the Soviet Union
                            did not wish any delay in the development of global arrangements to
                            cause delay in the arrangements with regard to the two German states. He
                            said that every effort should be made to develop global arrangements,
                            but these two questions should not be linked.</p>
                        <p>As to the President’s remark to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1"
                                >Adzhubei</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> said it was true that time could be an ally, but
                            observed that sometimes it could also be an enemy and could work against
                            the improvement of relations between our two states. The Soviet
                            Government believed that time was ripe for removing the dangers inherent
                            in the West Berlin situation. Therefore, both sides should seek methods
                            of reaching a speedy agreement. However, the USSR was opposed to
                            negotiations for the sake of negotiations; it was in favor of serious
                            negotiations. The USSR had agreed to bilateral exchanges of views and
                            continued to favor such exchanges. It hoped that such exchanges would
                            lead to positive results which would provide a basis for agreement on
                            the question of a German peace treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired what dangers Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> saw in the West Berlin situation and suggested
                            surely it was not the presence of Western forces.</p>
                        <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0110"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> responded by
                            reiterating that the situation in West Berlin was an abnormal one, since
                            it was frozen as it had emerged in the first days after the war. The US
                            might like that situation, but the USSR did not. There were many
                            unsatisfactory aspects to this situation, such as the presence of
                            Western forces in West Berlin, the continuation of the occupation status
                            in West Berlin, disregard for the sovereignty of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and many other questions still
                            remaining unresolved—such as frontiers, nuclear weapons, etc.</p>
                        <p>Perpetuation of this situation was not in the interests of the US either,
                            as least as the USSR saw those interests; nor was it in the interests of
                            peace in Europe. The Soviet Union proceeded on the basis of facts and
                            wanted the present situation to be in line with the actual situation in
                            Germany. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asserted
                            that there were few examples in history where for seventeen years after
                            the war there had been no peace treaty and where the situation, such as
                            that in West Berlin, had been preserved in the same form as it had
                            existed three days after the war. He contended that the acuteness of the
                            abnormal situation was compounded by such factors as the existence of
                            nuclear weapons, rockets, etc., which might give rise to accidents. He
                            wondered why one should play with this kind of a situation and why one
                            should not remove these time bombs left over from World War II, so that
                            all nations could breathe freely and live in peace and tranquillity.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>’s remark with regard to the link and said that
                            he had understood from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>’s statements in earlier conversations that the
                            Soviet proposal for access was specifically related to the withdrawal of
                            Western forces. He observed that the presence of Western forces was
                            considerably different from status and that it was conceivable to reach
                            agreement on a status that would be different from removal of Western
                            forces from West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Secretary’s question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> drew a diagram indicating three elements:
                            access, status, and troops. He drew lines between access and status and
                            between status and troops, but observed one could also draw a line
                            directly from access to troops. He said that the USSR had given the US
                            its views as to how it understood access in relation to status. Thus
                            access would lead to such West Berlin the status of which had been
                            agreed. [sic] As to the Soviet proposal on status, it was well known and
                            it included substitution of Western forces with neutral or <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>’s clarification was not very helpful, because it
                            still very much linked access to withdrawal of forces, which was not
                            negotiable. Referring to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>’s remark about tensions, the Secretary said that
                            tensions arise from the fact that the USSR had been asking for something
                            we could not give it. This was the heart of the matter. Furthermore,
                            both sides had commitments concerning <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89"
                                facs="0111"/>Germany and in that respect both of them were
                            interested in the factual situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary reiterated that both sides would like to think about what
                            had been said in Geneva and said he wished to report to the President
                            upon his return to Washington. Referring to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s remark with respect to
                            bilateral exchanges, the Secretary said both sides should get in touch
                            after they had carefully reviewed what had been said, because it was in
                            the interest of both sides to do everything they could in order to
                            settle these problems. The Secretary noted that he was not suggesting
                            any particular channel and invited Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> to make suggestions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the channel
                            for bilateral contacts could perhaps be worked out later. He remarked in
                            passing that if the US preferred to use Moscow there would be no
                            objection. In any event, the USSR would wish to know what prospects
                            there were and therefore the question of the form of contact should be
                            considered by both sides in the near future. He said that this stemmed
                            from the USSR’s desire to have serious negotiations to seek
                            possibilities for agreement rather than negotiations for the sake of
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that the US was also against negotiations for the
                            sake of negotiations and stressed the necessity of seeking solutions. He
                            expressed the hope that he could come to Moscow some time, but said he
                            was not sure if that fitted this situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> concluded the
                            conversation by saying that the Secretary would be welcome if he found
                            it possible to visit Moscow, including in connection with this problem.
                            However, this was of course something for the Secretary himself to
                            decide. He remarked that the Soviet Foreign Minister had been to
                            Washington whereas the US Secretary of State had not been to Moscow.</p>

                                    21</ref>.</note> I do not want to belabor the shooting incident.
                            However I must say that sending a letter of protest while doing nothing
                            is the surest way to make it meaningless.</p>
                        <p>That the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> police would shoot up an
                            occupied American military vehicle is shocking to the thinking German
                            and I might add to me, also, when we do nothing but write a letter of
                            protest while we wait for a reply. That this was done by <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> police was much more damaging to our
                            prestige than had it been done by Soviet personnel.</p>
                        <p>I appreciate the importance of the intelligence you obtain from our
                            Mission, but you must also appreciate the loss of American prestige
                            which is involved and its effect on the confidence of the German
                            people.</p>
                        <p>We seem to think that unless there is public hue and cry there is no
                            threat to morale. Thus, we argue that air harassments have not damaged
                            morale as air traffic has increased. This is far from the real truth as
                            the Germans who influence public thinking are watching every move in the
                            air to see what we will do. These same Germans are equally concerned to
                            find out how we will react to this most flagrant <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> attack. Secret harassment of Soviet Missions will be no
                            answer as an effective response must be evident to the public, nor will
                            reactions so long delayed as not to be instantly identified with the
                            cause.</p>
                        <p>I must admit that as I am queried by responsible Germans and Americans, I
                            do not find them particularly impressed by our firmness and
                            determination when I tell them that we have reacted by writing another
                            note.</p>

                                    are a number of points on which we could agree. Similarly, we
                                    did not reach a degree of disagreement on any point which

                            to know that, although our talks with Soviets will continue, we made no
                            real headway towards any substantive agreement on Berlin which we could
                            accept. As indicated in the joint American-Soviet statement issued this
                                morning,<note n="1" xml:id="d28fn1">For text of this statement, see
                                    <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,

                            was made in clarifying points of agreement and points of difference, but
                            points of difference remain fundamental.</p>
                        <p>I did obtain impression, however, that Soviets do not wish to have
                            confrontation now and desire to maintain contact with us on Berlin.
                            Whether this is consistent with continuing harassments in air corridors
                            and on ground access routes is an obviously related question. I have
                            this morning emphasized to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> that increased Soviet air corridor activity
                            today is inconsistent with spirit of our joint statement and that we
                            cannot help but draw judgments not only from what Soviets say about
                            desiring peaceful solution but also from what they do.<note n="2"

                        <p>The Secretary then turned to Berlin. Here we are no nearer the substance
                            of an agreement but there is a change in tone. At the beginning of the
                            meeting the Soviets had been willing to talk, but the initiative for
                            conversations had come from us. At the end of the meeting the initiative
                            had come from them, and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            had made it plain in his closing statements that they are committed to
                            further bilateral conversations. Yet they are still trying to convert us
                            to their basic view and have not yet really considered our arguments in
                            favor of a modus vivendi which recognizes the fact of basic
                            disagreement.</p>
                        <p>But the Soviet Union has made proposals on access which, if they could be
                            separated from their unacceptable position on Western troops in West
                            Berlin, would be helpful and worth considering carefully. They also
                            showed some interest in our actions of a modus vivendi.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, we did not get much help from <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on harassments in Berlin. He
                            professed ignorance of these harassments both at the beginning and the
                            end of the meeting. The Secretary recalled <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94"
                                facs="0116"/>his firm dealings with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> on the chaff issue and remarked that he had been
                            troubled to discover only later that chaff had been dropped in these
                            areas many times before, although perhaps in not so dangerous or
                            calculated a fashion. The President remarked that he also was troubled,
                            and in response to the President’s question the Secretary said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> seemed also not
                            to have known the history of chaff when he made a still stronger
                            statement to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. The
                            Secretary remarked that he had made it plain to <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at the end that we would listen
                            both to what the Soviets said and to what happened in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>In summary, the Secretary indicated his belief that we must match the
                            Soviets in patience and in persistence in these discussions. They were
                            quite willing to play their long-playing record over and over again, and
                            we should be ready to do the same thing. We should keep at it, clearly
                            and continuously. These discussions had not moved very far because
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had been bound
                            closely by his instructions, but we had kept right on showing our views
                            of the way of moving the problems forward. The conversations had been
                            courteous and sober. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had
                            personally been affable and friendly. The meeting took place with no
                            indication of an impasse. The Secretary reported that the Germans and
                            the French had been kept informed—although he later asked all concerned
                            to protect the fact of contact with the French (because <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">General de Gaulle</persName> is not informed of
                            it).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> added that the German
                            attitude had been excellent. The Secretary concluded by saying that
                            there was a lot of raw material from these conversations and that he and
                            his associates hoped to study it closely in the next few days and see if
                            we could formulate new proposals which might remove some suspicions. But
                            progress would be slow. The Secretary believed he had brought back a
                            thin piece of bacon, but we could go on from here.<note n="1"

                                    which differences remain to be resolved. To this end, the
                                    parties have agreed in regard to each of the issues under
                                    discussion: (i) on general principles, which will serve as a

                                    govern these continuing negotiations. In this connection, a
                                    Committee of Foreign Ministers’ Deputies will be established
                                    which France and the UK will be invited to join.</hi></item>

                                >Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> talk
                            must be given real significance. At this point, I am inclined to believe
                            that it marks the full end of the wall crisis and that we have won this
                            round which started just after the wall was in place.</p>
                        <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0121"/>
                        <p>I believe that the Soviets and East Germans had to erect a wall to stop
                            refugee flow but that it was hoped also it would panic West Berlin and
                            lead to Allied disagreements, particularly with <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss>. Thus, harassments against Allies were stepped up in
                            the belief that Allied failure to react would aid in creating panic in
                            West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>We met their harassments promptly and while I sometimes thought with less
                            strength than was desirable, I must admit with sufficient strength to
                            nullify any real fears they might have developed in West Berlin and to
                            convince the Soviet representatives that harassments to be effective
                            would truly involve the risk of war. Meanwhile, West Berlin, temporarily
                            stunned by the wall, recovered its morale and maintained a thriving
                            economy. It was evident that harassment alone could not destroy West
                            Berlin.</p>
                        <p>I do not pretend to know what the next Soviet move will be other than to
                            continue talks in a less oppressive atmosphere. However, I doubt if
                            harassments will remain the order of the day and I would predict a
                            stable and quiet situation here for several months. If there are no
                            negotiations or if negotiations take place and fail, we may expect
                            another Berlin crisis. If it comes again some months from now, I would
                            expect it to be directed against the West Berlin economy rather than
                            against the Allies.</p>
                        <p>I would urge even now that we increase our effort to sharpen our counter
                            measures, particularly to enable economic sanctions and blockades to be
                            placed in effect promptly. I think we have won a battle but not the
                            campaign and that we now have an interlude in which we can get ready for
                            the next battle.</p>
                        <p>Once again, I repeat that I think the immediate crisis in Berlin created
                            by the wall is over and that we have won this round. While it is still
                            only a battle and not the campaign, you have my sincere congratulations
                            for bringing it about.<note n="1" xml:id="d31fn1">In telegram 1892 from

                            with the President, the White House released a statement that said that
                            although there was as yet no settlement of the Berlin question, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> had reported that the
                            morale and economy of the city no longer required a full-time

                        <p>Turning to the second subject, he [<persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName>] said that quite frankly it seemed to him that
                            the Defense Department normally depends upon the State Department and
                            State upon Defense. He realized that what he was about to say concerned
                            primarily the State Department but he would say it to me because I was
                            there and it did have Defense implications. The Chancellor said he was
                            shocked by the latest messages from State about negotiations with the
                            Soviets on Berlin. These proposals envisage insuring access to Berlin,
                            but include recognition of the Soviet zone regime. Furthermore, the
                            security of access would depend on Sweden, Switzerland and Austria. He
                            outlined the 5–5–3 “Board of Directors” of an International Access
                            Authority in which a majority vote would be determinative. [<hi
                                rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] The
                            whole idea is impossible. The <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> would
                            be one of the five Communist States and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> one of the five Western States. This constitutes de
                            facto recognition of the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>. The latest
                            proposal includes elements of a solution of the Berlin problem, as such,
                            and also elements of an arrangement against the diffusion of nuclear
                            weapons. The Chancellor said he does not know what the UK and France
                            might think about these issues, but he is absolutely sure that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would say no. The <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> got these proposals two days ago with
                            the request that its position be sent to Washington yesterday. These
                            views have now been sent and they are negative. Furthermore, the
                            Chancellor said, he feels that such a procedure for working out
                            positions on the Berlin issue is poor. There have been many months of
                            talks in New York, Moscow and Geneva in which we have made a series of
                            concessions, and now we want to continue talks in Washington. The
                            Soviets pocket our concessions and take it for granted that they can
                            talk without making any concessions. Perhaps <persName corresp="#p_DGC1"
                                >De Gaulle</persName> is right; the negative outcome at every stage
                            makes the US role as negotiator for the three powers unsatisfactory.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor then said that he regrets General <persName
                                corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName>’s departure. (This remark was in a
                            friendly vein and did not appear to be a complaint.) <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DWC1"
                                >Dowling</persName> responded with recognition of <persName
                                corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName>’s important role in Berlin, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said he hoped to go to
                            Berlin tomorrow. The Chancellor said that it was a good idea at the time
                            to send <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> for it helped to
                            diminish unrest in Berlin arising from erection of the wall. He
                            understood that <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> was
                            discontented because he had no real position now and was sometimes
                            opposed to the views of the US Commander and even, at times, of the
                            Ambassador himself (general laughter).</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor commented that the latest US messages containing the 5–5–3
                            proposition for negotiations with the Soviets contributed to the unrest
                            arising from <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName>’s departure. He
                            reiterated his conviction that this message, if known to the public,
                            would create terrible unrest. Yesterday, he called in the Chairmen of
                            the three major parties in the <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0125"
                            />Bundestag, including the Socialists, and informed them about these
                            messages. The unanimous judgment was against the step envisaged by
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said that his remarks to us were meant only for those
                            concerned in Washington and not for the press. He is going to send
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> a message today
                            to ask that there be a pause in the negotiations with the Soviets so
                            that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will have time to
                            re-examine the Berlin problem and try to think of better ways to find a
                            solution. From our present knowledge of the Soviet position, it is quite
                            useless to keep coming back at them time and time again as we are now
                            doing. The Soviets pocket any concessions which we offer without giving
                            anything in return.</p>
                        <p>This morning, he said, a small group of people in his Government had
                            looked at the development of the Berlin situation and decided that the
                            prospects for resolution of the Berlin question in 1958 had been
                            considerably greater than they are now. The German position on the
                            Berlin question in this period may have contributed to this decline in
                            the prospects for a Berlin settlement, as it may have been too rigid.
                            The Chancellor now wants to re-examine the problem to see if it is not
                            possible to make some sort of offer to the Soviets which would be of
                            genuine interest to them. However, we must get some concessions from the
                            Soviets in order to make a deal. The Chancellor asked that nobody on the
                            US side say that Germany is undertaking such a re-examination until the
                            Germans see if any change in their position is possible.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said that he would be back
                            in Washington Sunday night and that he would see <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> on Monday and give him a personal
                            report of this conversation.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said he would be glad to have this done. He requested
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> to emphasize that
                            Germany is anxious to examine all the developments since 1958 to see if
                            any new proposition that might be meaningful to the Soviets can be
                            developed. He does not want to give more details about the German views
                            until he can clarify his own thinking.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> assured the Chancellor that
                            Washington would do nothing on Berlin without his agreement. The US
                            wants to work with Germany and with Britain and France. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> expressed the belief that the US
                            has conducted all of the talks with the Soviets about Berlin along the
                            lines of papers mutually agreed upon among the four powers, without any
                            concessions which deviate from these agreed papers, subject to certain
                            reservations contained in them. The US wants a joint position with the
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the UK and, as far as
                            possible, with France. Therefore, if the Chancellor wants a delay in the
                            talks at this time, <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said he
                            felt sure that this would be seriously considered.</p>
                        <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0126"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> observed that the 5–5–3
                            proposal is, of course, only for consideration of the four Western
                            Governments. The views of the UK, France and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> are necessary before the US would think of presenting
                            these proposals to the Soviets. The purpose of the messages from
                                <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> is to cause exploration
                            of this possible course of action among the four powers to determine
                            whether it would be wise to make such a proposal to the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor pointed out that if Germany should make proposals, France
                            might be more ready to agree to them than if the US did so. If specific
                            proposals were to be advanced and France should say no, the US would be
                            in a difficult position.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor then said that we will continue to have trouble in Berlin
                            but that he was aware some time ago that it is impossible to predict
                            what difficulties the Soviets might make. He handed Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> a newspaper containing an
                            article (“Neue Zurcher Zeitung”, Friday, April 13, 1962, page 2, column
                            1) about the unrest caused by General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1"
                                >Clay</persName>’s departure. He said that we must do nothing to
                            increase such unrest.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> pointed out that part of
                            the unrest arose because the story of <persName corresp="#p_CLD1"
                                >Clay</persName>’s departure leaked before <persName
                                corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> himself could explain his purpose
                            in leaving: that <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> is leaving
                            at his own request pursuant to a decision that he could do more to help
                            Berlin by returning to the US at this time. The premature leak from
                            Washington put his departure in the wrong light. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> said he talked with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> ten days ago in Berlin and
                                <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName>’s ideas had changed a
                            bit; he was leaving with a sense of accomplishment. The Ambassador hoped
                            that <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> would have a chance to
                            talk with the Chancellor before finally leaving Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor observed that he knew that <persName corresp="#p_CLD1"
                                >Clay</persName> had wanted to leave as long ago as last November.
                            The Chancellor said that he himself knows that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName>’s departure cannot be imputed to
                            the Administration but the public merely observes that he came at the
                            moment of crisis and is now leaving. This causes unrest. Another
                            official the other day had complained that the Ambassador himself might
                            soon be leaving.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador laughed and said that he was misquoted by the press. At a
                            press interview he had said that someday he would have to leave, but not
                            now; right now he was staying, not leaving. The Chancellor said he
                            wondered where the Ambassador would be going. To the State Department?
                                <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> said the press had
                            said so, but that <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>
                            told him the other day that he had not even heard of the story. The
                            Chancellor said that if and when the Ambassador was to leave, he should

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> began by saying
                            that he had received a lengthy telegram with preliminary comments on the
                            principles paper, and he might receive more. The Germans feel the need
                            of consultation on the paper. They note the concentration on West Berlin
                            and the recognition of vital interests of the Soviets in West Berlin.
                            Paragraph 1 (b) restricts the responsibilities to West Berlin but
                            acknowledges vital Soviet interests therein. The concept of the access
                            authority changes the legal position and makes it necessary to have a
                            common view among the US, the UK, and France. The Germans would like to
                            know how the British and French feel.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that the British
                            are in accord, and the French don’t have instructions on the
                            International Access Authority paper.<note n="1" xml:id="d35fn1">During

                                    >Hood</persName> wondered if there were any “desperate urgency”
                                about resuming discussions with the Soviet Union. (Memorandum of

                                held a similar conversation with <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                    >Rusk</persName> at 12:30 p.m. (Memorandum of conversation,
                                ibid.) <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> then met with
                                French Minister Counselor <persName corresp="#p_LC4"
                                    >Lebel</persName> at 3 p.m., who stated that the French had had
                                reservations about the approach to the Soviets from the beginning
                                and that these reservations remained. <persName corresp="#p_LC4"
                                    >Lebel</persName> handed <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                    >Kohler</persName> an aide-memoire incorporating a number of
                                French desiderata on parts of the papers that the French regarded as
                                “dangerous.” They too wondered if it were necessary to give
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> the revised
                                principles paper. (Memorandum of conversation; ibid.; aide-memoire;

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said the two
                            documents have a character different from the Geneva paper. They seem to
                            represent an exchange, and the principles paper is drafted in treaty
                            language from which it would be difficult to retreat.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said it was quite true
                            that the longer one talked the closer one got to negotiation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said the Geneva
                            version of the principles paper was indicative of general tendencies,
                            but the new version gave the appearance of covering the field of
                            negotiations. There was no mention of the things that remained
                            valid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said this was not the
                            concept. This paper was intended to register disagreement rather than
                            agreement. What is not in the paper remains as it is.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said that Bonn
                            realized this was the concept, but the Soviets will not understand the
                            text in the same way. Bonn would not be happy if the principles paper
                            were transmitted to the Soviets at the present stage. It offers
                            far-reaching concessions to the Soviets without receiving anything in
                            return. The Germans understand that the US is not as optimistic as the
                            press has been, and they think that in such a situation it would not be
                            wise to offer such a paper. Negotiations would not come about, but the
                            positions that were offered would be consumed and could not be offered
                            again.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said the Germans
                            feel Western rights are not really secured by the present text. A method
                            must be found to make clear that continued existence of Western rights
                            form the basis of the paper.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the status of Berlin, there is a strong tendency toward
                            considering West Berlin as an independent entity. No mention is made of
                            the ties with the Federal Republic.</p>
                        <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0129"/>
                        <p>The German question as such is dealt with in a manner tending to equalize
                            the two parts of Germany. Much of the language comes too close to the
                            “two Germanies” theory of the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Bonn cannot accept the concept of the mixed commission charged with
                            strengthening cultural ties. They also think that having the commission
                            which is to frame the electoral law consider other steps comes close to
                            the Soviet stand.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that this wording
                            was precisely that of the Geneva paper, and therefore, he was astonished
                            at the German stand. Only three non-substantive words have been changed.
                            This had already been cleared with Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said with
                            reference to nondiffusion in point 3, the Germans are not happy
                            concerning the reference to Germany, however ingenious it might be. They
                            feel the formula will fade, but the special reference to Germany will
                            remain. As to the substance, the present text goes considerably further
                            than the German statement of 1954,<note n="2" xml:id="d35fn2">Presumably
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> is referring to
                                Protocol III (Control of Armaments) to the Brussels Treaty, October
                                23, 1954, by which the Federal Republic undertook not to manufacture
                                atomic weapons. For text, see <ref target="frus1952-54v05p2#pg_1446"

                        <p>Concerning European security in point 4 it is really not European
                            security, but general security that is at stake. The mention in 4 b)
                            could be very misleading indeed and could lead to a concentration on
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Germans do not see a link between points 3 and 4 on the one hand and
                            points 1 and 2 on the other. This they consider very important inasmuch
                            as there is no reason to talk about 3 and 4 if there is no give on 1 and
                            2.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said the link exists in
                            our minds, and the points are not divisible. However, point 3 might come
                            out and get into the disarmament context. We have no intention of
                            getting into a nonaggression pact without a modus vivendi on Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said he wished to
                            turn to the access paper where the crucial point concerned composition
                            of the Board. The Germans have very strong objections because they feel
                            that this would not provide for real freedom of access. The neutrals
                            would be under heavy Soviet pressure. Such an arrangement would not keep
                            the Berliners calm because it would fail to assure them that the air
                            routes remained free.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said he noted as
                            a smaller point that the formula concerning the reestablishment of
                            German unity had been deleted.</p>
                        <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0130"/>
                        <p>The Germans were asking what really is the purpose of presenting the
                            papers at this stage where there seemed to be no serious readiness to
                            negotiate on the Soviet side. They wondered whether under such
                            circumstances it was really wise to present such a paper moving the
                            position in such a far-reaching way. We must also consider the fact that
                            the position would be further weakened in actual discussions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said he had a couple of
                            preliminary comments. First of all, he said, we regard the occupation
                            rights as guaranteed by the presence of our troops and our military
                            posture in general. These rights are clearly nonnegotiable. It is not
                            necessary to confirm them. This was a deliberate omission. Much has been
                            omitted on both sides. This paper is not intended to cover many points.
                            We have included language concerning the “vital interests”, in which we
                            include the presence of our troops, access, and viability. It is not a
                            contribution to say that our rights must be put in.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said that it was
                            not the German idea that there be an explicit reference to occupation
                            rights. The purpose was to avoid having such a paper used to deny
                            Western rights. This might be accomplished by accompanying unilateral
                            statements.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said such statements
                            are inevitable. Furthermore, the “legislative history” is quite
                            clear.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said the US feels the
                            current lull over Berlin may be connected with our decision on testing.
                            If, however, the Soviets are restrained in their reaction to our nuclear
                            tests this may be an indication of a tendency toward a modus vivendi. We
                            have gone to great pains to say we are just discussing, but we are
                            actually getting quite close to negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said the Germans
                            do not oppose negotiation as such but feel we should be very cautious
                            with texts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> commented that it would
                            be hard to carry on the discussions orally with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> without a paper to focus on.
                            He said the German view would be brought to the attention of the
                            Secretary and the President, and we would be in touch with the Germans
                            further. We must try to find some solution to the problem of the
                            composition of the Board of Directors of the Access Authority. We feel
                            we would be in pretty good hands with the Swiss, Swedes, and the
                            Austrians.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> asked how Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> saw events
                            developing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said he was not sure.
                            He would have to think about what the Germans had said and get in touch
                            with them.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said the Germans
                            really would hope that no paper would be given to the Soviet Ambassador
                            on Monday.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said this would be
                            passed on.</p>
                        <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0131"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said he would like to
                            add one more point concerning Berlin. We have made it clear that we are
                            not accepting a free, demilitarized, independent status. We thought the
                            language was harmonious with the existing status, but this is tricky
                            language.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> wondered why it
                            was necessary to give away this position at this stage. The Soviets
                            would surely come with their maximum position and we would have nowhere
                            to fall back.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said the Soviets had
                            tried this in Geneva, and had been told that no agreement was possible
                            on the kind of paper they were putting forward. It had been explained to
                            them that we were trying to go beyond this leaving out the disagreed
                            positions. We had tried to impress them with the fact that the basic
                            positions are nonnegotiable. We must see if a modus vivendi is possible
                            or if we must continue on a collision course.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> began the meeting by
                            commenting that a pretty full briefing was behind the stories out of
                                Bonn.<note n="1" xml:id="d36fn1">In the evening of April 13,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> had telephoned
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> to say that all the
                                main newspapers carried stories that included the principal points
                                of the two U.S. papers. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                    >Kohler</persName> added that the top levels of the U.S.
                                Government were “distressed” and wondered if “purposeful
                                consultation is possible.” (Memorandum of telephone conversation;
                                ibid., 762.00/4–1362) <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>
                                discussed the leak, telephone conversation with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, and the Chancellor’s
                                meeting referred to in this memorandum in Ruckblenden, pp. 549 ff.
                                During this meeting <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>
                                also transmitted the Chancellor’s letter (<ref target="#d37"
                                    >Document 37</ref>) to the President.</note></p>
                        <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0132"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said yes that was
                            true. He said he had been in touch with Bonn, and that Professor
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> had assured him
                            firmly that there had been no briefing by any official German source and
                            that everything possible had been done to prevent a leak. The spokesman
                            of the Foreign Ministry had stated that the Bonn meeting was merely an
                            exchange of views. He had expressly denied any connection with further
                            talks on Berlin. He had said the Federal Government was fully informed,
                            but further details could not be given. In answer to a question he had
                            said the project of an international access authority had been under
                            discussion since the President’s interview with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>. This was all that was said
                            officially. The text of the documents was known only to the small number
                            of people who attended the Chancellor’s meeting including the three
                            floor leaders of the three parties. Thus, the Ambassador said, he was
                            really not in a position to agree that these stories were the result of
                            a German leak. The first information concerning the exist-ence of a
                            document was in an AP story in the Washington Post yesterday. Just
                            because a story has a Bonn dateline, he continued, does not mean that it
                            comes from a German source. The New York Times, for example, frequently
                            plants in Bonn stories acquired elsewhere. In addition, there are a
                            number of foreign missions in Bonn.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said in this case it
                            was pretty obvious that the story had not originated with the New York
                            Times.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said he could not
                            say what the three floor leaders had done, but he and Professor
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> had done everything
                            possible to keep the documents secret. There had, of course, been much
                            speculation around the meeting in Bonn.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said it was pretty
                            obvious that this story came from an authoritative briefing.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said he failed to
                            see what the Germans could have hoped to gain from a leak. It would not,
                            after all, improve the Ambassador’s position, and that is well-known in
                            Bonn.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">2 paragraphs (3–1/2 lines of source text) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said this was a serious
                            problem, and the President and the Secretary had both been shocked.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said he could
                            understand this</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that in Geneva
                            everything had been given to the Germans, including the draft principles
                            paper, and nothing had leaked. Thus, he had thought the Ambassador’s
                            telegrams might be the source. He said we would just have to review the
                            situation and see if there were not a more secure means that could be
                            used.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> commented that
                            the US method of handling this consultation had been overly dramatic.
                            For two weeks the Germans <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0133"/>had
                            heard nothing, and then they were given 48 hours in which to
                            respond.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said there had really
                            been nothing new in the revised documents. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> demurred.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said he did not agree
                            that there was anything basically new. Furthermore, he did not see how
                            the Germans could disown the technical commissions, which they had
                            previously approved.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said this was
                            unfortunate, and he didn’t know how it had happened. In any event this
                            was not a crucial point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said there was some
                            inclination in the US Government just to turn the whole problem over to
                            the Federal Government and let it handle the matter.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> repeated he could
                            not agree that the leak came from a German source.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that the only
                            communication he knew of that had gone to Bonn on this subject was the
                            German message. None had gone to the US Embassy. Therefore, the source
                            had to be German.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (2–1/2 lines of source text) not
                                declassified]</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said he doubted that
                            this was the kind of message that would be broadcast by the Embassies
                            here. (Subsequent checks with the French and British Embassies indicated
                            that the French did not repeat their message to Bonn, but the British
                            did. The latter do not, however, regard themselves as primary suspects.)
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> continued by saying
                            that he thought the Secretary was going to send a personal message to
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> saying
                            how shocked we were about this and asking if he had any suggestions as
                            to how this could be prevented in the future. It is, after all, pretty
                            fantastic to read such an accurate account in the newspapers.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said the Germans
                            feel that it would be a better method to be in permanent contact and not
                            to ask for a response on such short notice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said he would report
                            this.</p>

                            attempts to open negotiations with the Soviet Union on Berlin have
                            failed. The latest proposals of the Department of State comprise
                            decisive elements concerning not only Berlin but also the German
                            question, which exceed all previous offers made to the Soviet Union. I
                            have considerable objections against some of these proposals and I would
                            urgently request you, my dear Mr. President, to consider interrupting,
                            for the time being, the negotiations and using this time to reexamine
                            all problems concerning Berlin in common with the three powers.<note

                            disclosure to the press in Bonn of certain details of the secret working
                            papers which we have been discussing with your government since our
                            meeting in Lausanne early in March. In giving the revised versions of
                            these papers to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>
                            on April 9, we impressed on him the need for utmost discretion in our
                            consultations regarding these matters and he informed us that this had
                            been stressed in his report to the Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>As you are aware, these are subjects of considerable delicacy which can
                            only be discussed between governments on a basis of mutual confidence
                            that premature public disclosure and comment will not give a distorted
                            impression in a way which can only result in weakening our position as
                            against the Soviets. It is difficult to see how useful consultations can
                            be conducted without the assurance on each side that confidences will be
                            respected.</p>
                        <p>I know you will personally share my concern and will agree that we must
                            both, in the future, make every effort to insure that subjects of
                            highest importance which are under current discussion between us are not
                            permitted to become public in a way which can only be detrimental to our
                            common interests. We are considering what changes we might make in
                            present consultative procedures, and I should appreciate any suggestions
                            you may be able to make in this connection.</p>
                        <p>We fully recognize that this is not a problem limited to Bonn and that
                            all of us are subject to the human frailty which expresses itself in
                            unauthorized leaks. But I am quite sure that it is important for us to
                            devise procedures which will make it possible for us to continue in
                            close touch on such an important and dangerous matter as Berlin.</p>

                            of the Berlin and German questions and that lively press attention to
                            our interview might have thrown this first talk somewhat out of
                            proportion. I told him that we had not, for example, taken for granted
                            that our two Governments had agreed that there would be a “new round of
                            talks” in Washington between him and myself. My clear understanding of

                            was that we would be in touch with each other about how further

                                <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> had our full
                            confidence and could be in touch with Soviet authorities in Moscow on
                            the same basis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            indicated that he had had no instructions from Moscow on this point but
                            that he would ascertain whether Moscow had any preferences and would be
                            in touch with me again.</p>
                        <p>I then proceeded to outline briefly where I thought we were in our talks.
                            I said that, in the interest of clarification, it might be useful to
                            think of our exchanges at three different levels.</p>
                        <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0137"/>
                        <p>The first had to do with what the Soviets have called “drawing a line
                            under World War II”. The Soviets had made proposals in 1958, and again
                            in June of last year in Vienna, about how the Soviet Government would
                            like to proceed with a permanent settlement on the German and Berlin
                            questions. I told him that the West, too, had ideas about how this ought
                            to be done. I mentioned proposals for reunification on the basis of free
                            elections and related elements of previous Western positions with which
                            he was familiar. I said that we had not pressed these proposals during
                            this past year because we did not see, realistically, any prospect of
                            agreement and that we did not think that it would improve the situation
                            for the two sides simply to engage in a propaganda contest over
                            irreconcilable positions.</p>
                        <p>The second “level” of exchanges had to do with the factual situation in
                            Germany. When we on our side have mentioned such matters as
                            reunification or all-Berlin arrangements, the Soviet side had spoken of
                            existing facts. Usually, these facts were stated by Soviet
                            representatives as meaning two Germanies. We, on the other hand, had
                            insisted that there was another fact—our position in West Berlin and our
                            free access to that city. I was glad that at Geneva the Soviet side
                            seemed to recognize that the facts in the situation include both the two
                            Germanies and West Berlin. One difficulty in our conversations thus far
                            had arisen from the confusion between these two levels of discussion.
                            When we talked about elements of a permanent solution, the Soviet side
                            said, “But look at the facts”. But when we turned to talking about
                            facts, the Soviet side said, “But these must be changed”.</p>
                        <p>A third level of discussion would concern itself with how we should
                            manage the fact of disagreement if it became apparent that we could not
                            come together either on a permanent solution or an agreement based upon
                            existing facts. The working paper on general principles which I handed
                            to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in Geneva was our
                            suggestion as to how we might deal with the existence of underlying
                            disagreement in such a way as not to move toward a dangerous crisis.</p>
                        <p>I then turned to the question of access and commented on the fact that we
                            had not gone into considerable detail with each other on our respective
                            proposals for an international access authority. Our difficulty with the
                            working paper on this subject which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> handed me at Geneva was that it was tied
                            organically to the withdrawal of Western forces from West Berlin. We did
                            not wish to leave any wrong impression through a detailed examination of
                            a paper which seemed to be rooted in an underlying demand which we could
                            not accept, namely, the removal of Western forces from West Berlin. I
                            repeated to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> what I
                            had said to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in Geneva,
                            namely, that I did not see any fundamental difficulty in working out
                            access arrangements which were consistent with what they called “the
                            sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” and what we <pb
                                n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0138"/>might call the responsibilities
                            of local authorities. Our international access proposals were aimed at
                            arrangements which would guarantee free access which would not interfere
                            with activities in East Germany. We still were of the opinion that this
                            was not an insoluble problem unless the Soviet side had in mind a type
                            of East German control over access which could be used to throttle West
                            Berlin.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that we were
                            not entirely clear from our talks at Geneva about the connection between
                            access arrangements and Soviet proposals for the withdrawal of Western
                            troops. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had seemed
                            to make this connection quite specific. At Geneva, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> had indicated to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> that this was something “for the
                            Ministers”. When I questioned Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> on this matter he used a diagram to show that
                            access was linked to the status of West Berlin and that the question of
                            status was, in turn, linked to the presence of Western troops.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
                            that “as of now” he would have to say that the “present position” of the
                            Soviet Government was that agreement on access is linked to the presence
                            of Western forces in West Berlin. “What the future attitude of my
                            Government might be, I would not be in a position to say”, he added.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I thought there might be some point in our exploring
                            further the question of access provided it was understood by the Soviet
                            side that we were not thereby changing in any way our attitude on
                            Western troops. The latter was not a negotiable problem from our point
                            of view. But it might be worth finding out whether the question of
                            access could move toward more agreement even though the major issue
                            remained in the background.</p>
                        <p>He asked where I thought we stood on some of the other “broader
                            questions” which had been mentioned both at Geneva and in recent press
                            accounts. I repeated the point that I had made to <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in Geneva, namely, that if we
                            could find a way of dealing with the central issues of vital concern to
                            the West, I felt that a number of these other matters would fall into
                            place. As he knew from reading the press of the last few days, we were
                            in the process of consulting our allies. He laughed and said, “That is
                            very evident”.</p>
                        <p>It became clear from <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>’s
                            conversation that he had had no instructions to continue further from
                            where <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and I had left off
                            in Geneva, or, if so, had been instructed not to pursue the matter in
                            this particular conversation. We agreed therefore, not just to reiterate
                            to each other what <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and I
                            had said to each other at Geneva. In the course of general conversation,
                            however, the following additional points came up:</p>
                        <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0139"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that West Berlin was
                            an outpost of the West capable of causing real trouble between us. He
                            was not thinking of it as a strong military base but as a situation
                            which could cause accidents or incidents of a dangerous sort. Therefore,
                            it was in the interest of both sides to eliminate this source of
                            trouble. He said that he was not clear just why we attach so much
                            importance to our position in West Berlin—whether it was a question of
                            prestige or just what it was.</p>
                        <p>I said that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> had
                            covered this point in considerable detail with Chairman <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> in Vienna. The President had
                            pointed out the nature of our commitment to West Berlin and the effect
                            upon our entire position if we were to permit that position to be
                            eliminated or diminished. It would be wrong for the Soviet side to build
                            its hopes upon the results which President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> had clearly indicated we could not accept. I
                            said that we felt that there might be some wishful thinking in some
                            quarters of Moscow derived from the geographic location of Berlin. I had
                            earlier told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that
                            they could think about the political problems of Berlin more accurately
                            if they imagined Berlin to be located on the demarcation line between
                            the Federal Republic and East Germany. The geographical isolation of
                            West Berlin was irrelevant because the Western allies were there and
                            would remain there. I said that it would not surprise me to know, for
                            example, that some Soviet military advice might be that this should be
                            an easy problem; but it was an easy problem, from that point of view,
                            because the United States is in West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and I exchanged a few
                            words about President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>’s
                            remark to <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> that time
                            might make some of these problems easier to solve. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> recalled <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s remark to me at Geneva that
                            time could work the other way. I said that I recalled that remark and
                            that I had passed it by because Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> had referred to Hitler and I was quite sure that
                            he did not intend to equate us with Hitler. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he was quite sure that
                            was not Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s intention.
                            He asked how I saw time working to improve this principal point of
                            confrontation between the two Governments. I said that time might ease
                            their own pressures in East Germany; that time might make practical
                            relationships in Germany more feasible and more conducive to a normal
                            atmosphere; that time might make it possible to make some significant
                            advances in disarmament, about which we were very serious. He asked me
                            whether Berlin and disarmament are linked. I said they were not
                            organically linked but obviously progress in one would help in progress
                            on the other. He commented that the reverse could also be true.</p>
                        <p>Again, on the effect of time I pointed out that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> had moved early in his
                            Administration to try to create an atmosphere of calm in the
                            relationships between our two Governments and, particularly, <pb n="118"
                                xml:id="pg_118" facs="0140"/>to restore effective contact between
                            us. Even though we might not be able to agree on important issues, we
                            had felt that responsible contact at all times was important. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> agreed and said that this had
                            been much appreciated in Moscow and we mentioned the release of flyers,
                            the cultural agreement<note n="4" xml:id="d39fn4">For text of the
                                U.S.-Soviet cultural agreement, signed on March 8, see 13 UST
                                1496.</note> and the variety of exchanges we have had as evidence of
                            more effective communications. I told him that we thought that his own
                            assignment in Washington as Ambassador was a step in improving
                            communications, which he accepted with obvious pleasure.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that we were
                            not unaware of the fact that shortly after Geneva the situation in West
                            Berlin itself had significantly improved. I had said to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that we should be listening
                            with both ears—with one to what is said, and with the other to what is
                            done in Berlin; I was glad to see that matters had moved to a much more
                            normal position there since Geneva and that we felt this was a wholesome
                            contribution. He nodded acquiescence.</p>
                        <p>I told him that we were prepared to go ahead with conversations as
                            anticipated by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and me
                            at Geneva and that we were not on our side wishing to procrastinate—and
                            reminded him of my exchange with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> on that subject in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>My net impressions of this one hour’s talk with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> were (a) he was not under
                            instructions to pursue these questions on their substance; (b) he did
                            not attempt to leave any impression that the Soviets were in any hurry;
                            (c) he clearly did not attempt to leave any impression that they wished
                            to move the matter to a crisis or showdown; (d) he was amused but
                            entirely relaxed about the press flap out of Bonn; (e) he would report
                            our conversation and be in touch with me again about any suggestions
                            Moscow had about how the conversations might continue and (f) he thought
                            my outline of the three levels of discussion was a useful clarification
                            and had thought so when I first presented it to <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>He seemed equally relaxed about Laos, which he mentioned on his
                            initiative just before leaving. I told him that it must be obvious to
                            them that we were making serious efforts to support the idea of a
                            negotiated coalition government, that we were having some difficulties
                            with the RLG leadership and that we thought that it might take a little
                            more time to bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I had told the press for background that they should not
                            expect too much from this meeting this afternoon, that this was our
                            first contact since Geneva, that one of the matters we would be
                            discussing <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0141"/>was in what way we
                            might continue the discussions between our two Governments on these
                                problems.<note n="5" xml:id="d39fn5">On April 23 <persName

                                raised general objections to the lack of reference in the U.S. paper
                                to reunification, Western forces in Berlin, and <gloss
                                    target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-Berlin ties, and specific
                                objections to the composition of the access authority, respect for

                                the mention of Germany in the nuclear diffusion ban. (Ibid.)</note>
                            that Germans still do not fully understand nature of approach in US
                            “principles paper”. When you see <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> you should accordingly point out that, as
                            indicated by Secretary at Lausanne and in briefings given Germans at
                            Geneva, what we are trying to do is deal with existence of underlying
                            disagreement on elements of permanent solution and even on formulations
                            of existing facts in such a way as to avoid dangerous crisis. Our paper
                            attempted <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0142"/>to set forth certain
                            principles which might be agreed by both sides, omitting those points on
                            which no verbal agreement could be reached, in an effort to create basis
                            for possible modus vivendi. In addition it would provide forum for
                            continuing discussion of questions which could not be agreed now but
                            which involve points of possible future conflict. Inevitably then, paper
                            would have conspicuous omissions. To insist on inclusion of every
                            Western point would merely result in Soviet insistence on inclusion
                            every Soviet point unacceptable to West, and effort to put Berlin
                            problem on back-burner by tactic indicated would inevitably collapse, as
                            it may in any event in face of possible Soviet intransigence.</p>
                        <p>As to Western unilateral declarations, we assume that unilateral public
                            explanations regarding omissions would be inevitable in case modus
                            vivendi on this basis ever reached which does not seem early likelihood.
                            However, we had not anticipated that these would have to be formally
                            drawn up in advance, or in any case at such an early stage as
                            present.</p>
                        <p>On specific point of mixed commissions, other than change of a few
                            non-substantive words, language in 2 (b) is identical with that
                            contained in paper given <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            at Geneva to which Germans did not object. New language in paragraph at

                            persons in Berlin.</p>

                            Secretary accepted as adequate explanation for present.</p>
                        <p>Secretary then reviewed US vital interests in West Berlin as immediate
                            questions and matters such as disarmament, non-aggression pacts,
                            diffusion nuclear weapons, etc., as broader questions. Repeated US
                            belief that if West Berlin vital interests agreed on, then others might
                            fall more easily into place. However, if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> demand for end of Occupation is essential
                            element Sov position, then obstacles to agreement indeed formidable.
                            Secretary referred to Geneva principles paper and International Access
                            Authority proposal as possible sources progress, if these could be
                            discussed on basis essential needs both sides. Principles paper
                            deliberately omitted certain points of interest both sides but does
                            provide means for continuing discussion on disagreed matters. In
                            general, broader questions seemed susceptible movement and improvement,
                            which thus brought us back to essential elements. For Berlin, this was
                            our presence there. Secretary added that for disarmament, this was
                            verification question.</p>
                        <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0144"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had nothing new
                            on German question. His instructions were clear that Sov position on end
                            of Occupation and Western troop presence remained as stated by <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary then examined Berlin problem against background developments in
                            European integration, pointing out that possibility intra-European wars
                            now gone after 500 years of intrigue, conflicts, etc. This was important
                            for USSR security, particularly when taken with close link US to Western
                            Europe. We believe presence US troops Berlin is actually a stabilizing
                            factor as long as Germany is divided. We do not agree with <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that absence peace treaty in
                            Central Europe creates dangers. Unless Sovs intend push us out of West
                            Berlin, lack of permanent German settlement not dangerous. Obviously, if
                            Sovs do want to push us out, then situation indeed dangerous.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> agreed that possibility
                            European wars now remote. He disagreed that situation in Europe was not
                            most important problem. Speaking “with deep conviction as Russian” he
                            said Sovs could not accept Western troops in Berlin. Possibility that
                            either German side could involve Sov and US troops in clashes was a
                            danger. This was really only US–USSR point of confrontation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said direct contact of troops of responsible powers not
                            necessarily dangerous. No Man’s Land such as Korea had proved more
                            dangerous.</p>
                        <p>Discussion then turned to reunification prospects and recognition <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> with no change in either side’s
                            position. Secretary stressed we do not think division of Germany is good
                            for anyone. It is the Sovs who wished make division permanent.
                            Therefore, although practical situation obviously must continue as it is
                            for time being, we believe it important not to foreclose question of
                            reunification.</p>
                        <p>Secretary concluded that we had gone far to indicate agreement possible
                            on some points, but Sovs must first come to grips with problems of
                            access and presence. He suggested that conversation turn to these when
                            he comes back.<note n="5" xml:id="d42fn5"><persName corresp="#p_RD3"

                            which unlike Sov paper, did not touch on controversial points. For
                            example, our paper omitted any confirmation of Occupation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> agreed resume talks upon
                            Secretary’s return, but pointed out he foresaw no change in Sov
                            positions in next ten days. Secretary said he foresaw no change in ours

                        <p>The President remarked that the Prime Minister and he had discussed
                            privately the course of the conversations on Berlin with the

                            would see <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> again. The
                            President noted that he and the Prime Minister were in agreement on
                            these talks.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Secretary, pointing out that we were in Berlin and were going to stay
                            there, stressed that both we and the British should point out to Bonn
                            and Paris that we had made no concession to the Russians. The course of
                            future discussions is another question. We had no apologies for the
                            stand we have taken, and the nervousness displayed by some of our allies
                            is out of place. In answer to the Prime Minister’s question, the
                            Secretary said that in yesterday’s talk with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> he had pointed out that we had gone some way to
                            meet the Soviets on points of interest to them. However, there were no
                            signs that they were prepared to give us any satisfaction; we were nose
                            to nose on the key issues. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>’s attitude, which showed no obligation or
                            interest in accelerating things, was puzzling. There were some signs of
                            interest in a modus vivendi paper.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister commented that he had remarked to the President that
                            it was difficult to negotiate when we were under pressure, as we were
                            then accused of appeasement; we should press forward when we are not
                            under the disadvantage of pressure. As an agreement would involve too
                            much loss of face for the Soviets, we might end up with some sort of
                            modus vivendi, an agreement to disagree. The results, the Secretary
                            remarked, would depend on whether the Soviets have decided they cannot
                            make progress on their proposals. Our concern is their commitment <pb
                                n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0146"/>to a peace treaty; if our
                            rights are not respected when such a treaty is signed, there will be a
                            dangerous situation. The Secretary suggested that the danger, which
                            would arise when pressure was resumed, could be lessened by remaining in
                            contact. In the meantime we should try to alleviate the nervousness of
                            our allies.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President’s question, the Prime Minister said he had
                            no plans to see <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>.
                            Depending on his talks with <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName>, the Secretary indicated he might see
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> on his way home from
                            Athens. The President, indicating his concern that the Germans might at
                            some future time wish to put the blame on us, said that it was most
                            important that <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> show his
                            approval. The French had disassociated themselves from what we were
                            doing; it was important not to let the Germans do the same thing. The
                            Secretary said he thought <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>
                            was not receiving accurate reports, adding that we had one point of
                            disagreement with the Germans. Even without reunification in the near
                            future, we thought it was in our interest for the West Germans to
                            multiply contacts with East Germany, but the Chancellor seemed nervous
                            over doing so. <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>’s
                            personality was, apparently, a real stumbling block.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister mentioned his concern over the myth growing up and
                            about what the younger generation of Germans would think about our
                            policy. The President commented that such a myth, that we had let the
                            Germans down, had already grown up in connection with the Berlin wall.
                            In response to the President’s question, the Prime Minister said that he
                            was already planning to see <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> in June, and he would go to see <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> if it would help, even though
                            it was becoming somewhat more difficult to talk to him. The Prime
                            Minister thought it important to get the younger Germans with us, as
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>, a good man, was.
                            The Secretary remarked that we hoped to make some prog-ress with
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName>, who would be
                            here shortly.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister, expressing great concern, said now was the time to
                            get an agreement, or a modus vivendi as the Soviets would not make a
                            formal agreement. Such a result might not be too far from what we had
                            considered and almost agreed on just before the new American
                            administration assumed office. These talks, he recalled, broke down on
                            the point of what would happen after five years. The Secretary said we
                            were trying to return to something similar, but using Deputy Foreign
                            Ministers. The Secretary, in answer to the Prime Minister’s question,
                            said we had given a paper to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> in Geneva, but nothing since. After the meeting
                            of the four Foreign Ministers, we might amplify the Geneva paper. We had
                            to be precise enough to cover ourselves after the Soviets signed their
                            peace treaty. The Prime Minister thought a summit meeting might produce
                            a modus vivendi.</p>
                        <p>At another point in the day’s discussions the Prime Minister raised
                            Berlin again. He favored the idea of working toward something which <pb
                                n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0147"/>could be put to the heads of
                            government. He was willing to do everything he could with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1"
                                >De Gaulle</persName>. He expressed concern about the possibility of
                            a crisis in East Germany, of a Hungarian-type uprising, which would be
                            very embarrassing. The Prime Minister was sure that we should take
                            advantage of the period of calm; the storms were just below the horizon.
                            If a storm were to come, many of those now criticizing us would not be
                            of much help. We could not wait because of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1"
                                >De Gaulle</persName>.</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> sent a memorandum
                                to the President stating that <persName corresp="#p_BH4"
                                    >Brentano</persName> needed to take away from the conversation
                                the following four points: 1) the United States was determined to
                                defend Berlin, and the President, not the German press, was in
                                charge of this defense; 2) the United States found <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> both reliable and able; 3)
                                German critics of the U.S. position were generally ill-informed; and
                                4) the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> administration
                                was not likely to be swayed by politically inspired leaks, and those
                                responsible for them would lose influence with the United States.

                        <p>The President expressed his sympathy to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4"
                                >Von Brentano</persName> regarding his automobile accident and said
                            he was glad to see him in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName> said he was happy
                            to be able to make the trip despite the accident and grateful for the
                            opportunity to talk to the President. He said he wanted to point out at
                            the beginning in order to avoid misunderstanding that he was not in the
                            United States in an official capacity, but rather as a member of the
                            German Parliament and Head of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>
                            Parliamentary Group. He stressed, however, that there were no
                            differences between himself and the Federal Government, the Chancellor
                                <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0148"/>or Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>. He acknowledged
                            that in the last days before Easter certain misunderstandings had been
                            reported in the German press. He had left for France and did not hear
                            about them until later. In connection with the US-Soviet talks, there
                            had been a meeting in Bonn, but he assured the President that no one who
                            participated in that meeting wanted indiscretions. He said anyone who
                            knew him would know that he would not commit such an indiscretion. He
                            said he realized that one could not have a common policy with a major
                            ally if there were such indiscretions. He could not be sure, however,
                            that someone else was not responsible.</p>
                        <p>The President said he knew Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von
                                Brentano</persName> was not responsible for the indiscretions
                            because we had worked with him in the past. The President then went on
                            to say that the problems we have with the Soviets are extremely
                            difficult. They are unsolvable in a real sense and may be unsolvable
                            even as far as lesser matters are concerned. We could not even begin to
                            deal with them, however, if our proposals came out in the press and
                            become part of a political controversy.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to the difficulty of getting together proposals
                            and noted that it was easy to criticize from the outside. He cited the
                            criticism that had been made since the erection of the wall in
                            Berlin—i.e., that it should have been taken down brick by brick—but said
                            we had adopted the course we considered most responsible. The President
                            said there might be some things in the documents we had prepared which
                            should be changed. No one wanted to dictate to the Germans, who were
                            most involved geographically and personally, what they should do. This
                            is why we had submitted documents for their comments.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked that if the present situation were satisfactory,
                            we would not need a modus vivendi. It was not satisfactory, however, and
                            that is why we wanted to try to change it. He referred to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s rude remark about being
                            able to squeeze the West in Berlin any time he wanted to. Perhaps we
                            could not change this situation, but we should try to do so.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had the feeling the press in Bonn was carrying on a
                            war against the United States, accusing the United States of being weak
                            and lacking determination. He pointed out that since his Vienna meeting
                            with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, he had increased
                            the United States defense budget by $3–1/2 billion, had called up two
                            divisions of reservists with all the difficulties involved, would soon
                            have seven more combat divisions in readiness than were available when
                            he took office and had sent General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1"
                                >Clay</persName> to Berlin. In addition, we were taking the risk of
                            war, were getting ready for a possible blockade, and had passed national
                            emergency legislation. We were also taking on the burden of trying to
                            reach a solution with the USSR on these problems. At the same time, the
                            United States was under constant attack while the French were <pb
                                n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0149"/>held up as a good example. Yet
                            the French had only two divisions in Germany and the two divisions
                            recently recalled to France from Algeria were not even fully armed. The
                            President said that if someone else wanted to carry on negotiations with
                            the USSR, it was all right with him. For the past seven months, the
                            United States had had only headaches.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName> said that neither
                            he nor his friends had ever reproached the United States for weakness or
                            lack of determination. In fact he could cite additional illustrations to
                            the contrary. He said the United States and Germany have common policy
                            objectives, but there were some misunderstandings. Perhaps the fact that
                            the Federal Government had been asked to comment on the United States
                            proposals had stirred up unrest in Bonn because it was felt that there
                            were far-reaching implications involved. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4"
                                >Von Brentano</persName> said the Germans had welcomed talks with
                            the USSR, being fully aware of their importance and the importance of
                            mitigating present tensions. He added that all Germans were aware of the
                            great responsibility for the United States and the Free World which
                            rested on the President’s shoulders.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed his appreciation and said that in any
                            negotiations it was easy to sit outside and say what should or should
                            not be done—e.g., in labor-management negotiations. He went on to say
                            that there were basic disagreements with the USSR on Western presence in
                            Berlin, on the Soviet free city proposal, and on the Soviet desire for
                            presence in West Berlin. He emphasized that the United States would not
                            recognize East Germany de facto or de jure. It was necessary, however,
                            to see if there was any possibility of reaching an accord which would
                            prevent increased tensions every few months and would end the situation
                            whereby West Berlin could be saved only by the threat of war. He pointed
                            out there might be greater trouble after the USSR had signed a peace
                            treaty with the East Germans.</p>
                        <p>The President said he realized that the United States objection to the
                            diffusion of nuclear weapons created difficulties for Germany, but
                            indicated that we had a problem with the French on this matter and that
                            our policy was a general one not directed against Germany. As far as the
                            non-aggression pact between <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                            the Warsaw pact was concerned, the President thought it should be
                            possible to word it differently to meet German objections. He suggested
                            that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName> discuss the
                            question of technical commissions with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"

                            If parts of the United States <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0150"
                            />proposals were not acceptable, the United States wanted to hear the
                            German comments. The President hoped Germans realized, however, that we
                            could not get everything we wanted. Otherwise, there would be no
                            possibility of trying to reach an agreement.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName> agreed with the
                            President on non-diffusion of nuclear weapons, saying it was not a
                            problem and not necessary to discuss since he understood the United
                            States legal situation. The important thing was whether or not we had a
                            functioning Atlantic Alliance ready to react to any threat. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName> said it was not
                            necessary to talk about non-aggression pacts either because he was also
                            sure some acceptable formulation or language could be found. He noted,
                            however, that guarantees from the other side were of problematic value
                            and cited <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s definition
                            of wars of liberation. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von
                                Brentano</persName> said it was necessary to discuss some things,
                            privately not publicly, because of our responsibilities to the German
                            and American people.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question of recognizing the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName>
                            indicated this was not a prestige factor, but a political question of
                            overriding importance. The participation of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> on equal terms with the great powers in an
                            international access authority would tend to place it on the same
                            footing with such powers. The establishment of joint commissions was
                            also potentially dangerous because it could set in motion a train of
                            events leading to the establishment of an all-German commission. He did
                            not think this would happen under the present government, but he was
                            afraid that a first step in this direction could lead to a second step
                            which would be disastrous—i.e., taking Germany out of the Western
                            Alliance. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName>
                            stressed the necessity of avoiding any developments which would open up
                            such vistas. This concern was the basis of his reserve and warning.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName> pointed out that
                            the Federal Government had agreed in 1959 to the establishment of joint
                            technical commissions as part of the over-all Herter Plan.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d44fn2">For text of the Western Peace Plan (“Herter Plan”),
                                May 14, 1959, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985,

                                    Current Documents, 1959</hi>, pp. 655–663.</note> If those
                            commissions were established apart from such an over-all plan, however,
                            it could lead to all-German conversations. He was not worried about the
                            threat of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, but about the
                            possibility of weakening the Western Alliance. If Germany left the
                            Western Alliance or if such a possibility were implied in any proposals,
                            the consequences would be very serious.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von
                                Brentano</persName> what it was in the United States proposals that
                            worried him. We were talking about West Berlin and East Berlin and
                            others participating in an international access authority on a basis
                            giving the West and the others a clear majority over <pb n="129"
                                xml:id="pg_129" facs="0151"/>the Communists. He pointed out that
                            West Berlin and East Berlin and the other members each had a different
                            status. Recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was not
                            involved. The President noted that the United States had been dealing
                            with Communist China at Geneva without recognizing it. He said he would
                            have the same problem if he tried to change United States policy toward
                            Communist China and, therefore, he understood German sensitivity in this
                            matter, but he emphasized that dealing with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> did not mean recognition, as demonstrated by the fact
                            that the Federal Republic dealt with the East Germans on 90 per cent of
                            Berlin access at the present time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said it was a question
                            of technical functions not political institutions.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName> replied that the
                            proposed commissions were really political institutions. He said he was
                            fully aware that German reunification could not be brought about now by
                            the United States or Germany, but he thought the common goal of
                            reunification should not be given up. If there were all-German talks or
                            an all-German commission, the impression would be created that the
                            Western Alliance was not interested in the peaceful reunification of
                            Germany and had shifted the problem to the Germans. In those
                            circumstances, people in Germany would say it was up to the Germans to
                            settle this problem. This development could be dangerous.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von
                                Brentano</persName> discuss with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                >Kohler</persName> the language establishing technical commissions
                            to see if a way could be found of meeting the problem without lessening
                            the commitment to reunification. He emphasized again, however, that it
                            would not be possible to reach an agreement with the USSR that would
                            fully satisfy everyone. He thought it would be useful to distinguish
                            between what was unsatisfactory and what was verboten. Unless some
                            agreement could be reached on possible proposals, we would have to stop
                            the conversations with the USSR.</p>
                        <p>The President said we envisaged a technical access authority which would
                            actually govern traffic to Berlin. This traffic was being controlled
                            now. The question was how we could set up a system assuring continued
                            traffic for the next few years at least. With this objective in mind, we
                            had put forth proposals to see if it was possible to create a basis for
                            seeking such a solution. The President expressed the view that the
                            present situation with respect to Berlin access was unsatisfactory since
                            it gave the USSR great opportunities for interference. For example, the
                            Soviets could insist on certain visas. As a result, no Germans would
                            travel. He wondered where this would lead to.</p>
                        <p>The President said the French did not want to be associated with our
                            efforts because they wanted to avoid criticism in the future that
                            Germany <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0152"/>had been sold out by
                            the West. In the President’s opinion, this was taking the easy way
                            out.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName> said he knew that
                            if the situation was serious, it was necessary to try to find an
                            accommodation. He was aware that concessions on both sides would be
                            necessary, but as the President himself had said, one could not
                            negotiate on the basis of “what’s mine is mine and what’s yours is
                            negotiable”.</p>
                        <p>The President said that it was necessary to see if some middle ground
                            could be found. For this reason, we had given our proposals to the
                            Federal Government for comment. The President said he did not mind
                            accepting responsibility and abuse since he thought it was in
                            ev-eryone’s interest to try to reach an understanding. He thought the
                            present relative calm should be used to pursue conversations with the
                            USSR. It was better to talk now than under pressure. He added he had
                            observed that when those most opposed to conversations were asked to
                            face up to the possibility of war or to the necessity of economic, naval
                            or air blockade, they always wanted to do something else. Therefore,
                            these problems should be discussed now.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName> said he had been
                            involved in many negotiations and he knew the difficulty of getting
                            answers to difficult questions. He emphasized he was not entitled to
                            reproach the United States nor interested in doing so. He wanted to
                            express some apprehensions because he thought a frank exchange of views
                            and expression of feelings were essential. He added that after reading
                            the press in recent days, he frankly did not know where we stood. He
                            emphasized, however, that it was silly to say anyone in Germany wanted
                            worsened relations with the United States because all Germans knew how
                            dependent they were on United States friendship and support.</p>
                        <p>The President said there seemed to be stories in the press every day
                            criticizing the United States. He referred to the Gruson article in the
                            New York Times of April 28 carrying the headline “<persName
                                corresp="#p_BH4">Brentano</persName> Uneasy Over Bonn-US Tie”. He
                            said it was easy to cast blame from the outside. He noted that the
                            Federal Government had not yet established the 18-months conscription
                            period, nor had it passed emergency legislation. Despite this, there was
                            antagonism against the United States. The President pointed out the
                            United States probably would have a deficit of $4 billion this year and
                            that if it had not been for the Berlin problem, he could have had a
                            balanced budget and could have reduced taxes.</p>
                        <p>The President repeated that if the United States and the Federal Republic
                            could not reach an understanding, it would not be possible to go on with
                            the talks with the USSR. He said he wanted a private exchange of views
                            about mutual interests and in the spirit of mutual confidence. He
                            indicated he was aware that United States relations with the Federal
                            Republic in the last fifteen years were the best we had had with any <pb
                                n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0153"/>country, with the exception of
                            the United Kingdom where we had a special relationship. He added that he
                            was also aware of German assistance to the United States balance of
                            payments. He expressed the view that the poison in the newspapers was
                            bad for both sides as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1"
                                >Grewe</persName> well knew.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that by not sharing nuclear information with France,
                            we were avoiding creating difficulties for Germany. We were also
                            supporting the Common Market which created difficulties for the United
                            States, but helped Germany. The President thought that perhaps there was
                            a breakdown in communications between the United States and Germany and
                            that both sides should work harder and more quietly. He said the United
                            States was totally stunned by the heat of the reaction in Bonn to the
                            United States proposals for discussion with the USSR. When he had
                            approved these proposals, the President added, he had assumed they were
                            in accord with the understanding reached by our two governments.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName> agreed that things
                            had not taken the best course in Bonn. Turning to the Gruson interview,
                            he said he had known the correspondent for years and that he had had a
                            long talk with him at which no notes were taken. He did not evade
                            questions which were in the air because that would have been foolish. On
                            the other hand, he could not accept responsibility for what the New York
                            Times or the German press wrote afterwards. It was silly to say that he
                            was in the United States to propose alternatives. He was not here on
                            behalf of the Federal Government and he could not accept an official
                            task in his present position.</p>
                        <p>The President again suggested that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von
                                Brentano</persName> go over the United States proposals with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> and give his opinions.
                            The President said he knew we shared the same objectives, but that he
                            would welcome Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName>’s
                            thoughts, particularly as to what would cause difficulties in the long
                            range and what might be unpleasant but could be lived with.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the President suggested it would be best in handling the
                            press after this interview to say that there had been a general
                            discussion and exchange of views which had been good and useful. He
                            advised against suggesting that there had been any discussion of details
                            and thought nothing should be said about any protest. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName> fully agreed.</p>
                        <p>As they were leaving the room, the President asked Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName> what he thought would
                            happen to the price of Volkswagens. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von
                                Brentano</persName> expressed the hope they would go the way United
                            States steel prices had.</p>

                        <p>The pre-lunch conversation opened with a thorough discussion of the leaks
                            of the US proposals to the Soviets in Bonn. Views were exchanged along
                            well-known lines and it was agreed that while there were possible
                            theories as to the source and motivation of the leaks, nothing could be
                            definitely established and the question should be regarded as closed.
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> pointed
                            out the political difficulties of his situation in which he was under
                            attack within his own party as “soft.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> then went on to the question of communications
                            and consultation between the two Governments and put in a plea that this
                            should resume through the channel of Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> in Washington. He pointed out
                            that since <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> was so
                            thoroughly familiar with all the details, the reports which he submitted
                            were fuller and more useful to him than those received from Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName>, who had no means of
                            supplementing his instructions in reply to questions as happened when
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> saw, for
                            example, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> in the State
                            Department. [<hi rend="italic">4–1/2 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The conversation then continued at the luncheon table. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> talked at some length about
                            the desirability of an early visit to Bonn by the Secretary. In reply
                            the Secretary indicated that he had considered this. Unfortunately it
                            would not be possible in connection with the present visit since he was
                            committed to proceed on to Australia. There seemed some possibility that
                            if the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting should end on
                            Saturday he might be able to go briefly to Bonn on Sunday, however this
                            appeared to be rather remote. Otherwise he was under some fire from <pb
                                n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0155"/>Congress with respect to his
                            travels. It was for this reason that he had made arrangements to bring
                            together the CENTO, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and ANZUS
                            meetings within a period of ten days. This might also mean that it would
                            be preferable for him to visit Bonn after the adjournment of the
                            Congress, that is, in July, though he did not rule out that arrangements
                            could be made before that date.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then reviewed in broad terms his discussions with <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>. He said he thought that there was some
                            misunderstanding with respect to the broad questions included in the US
                            Draft Principles paper. He pointed out that there had been no real
                            discussion of these broader questions with the Russians. The Secretary
                            had rather emphasized the question of vital interests and indicated that
                            if agreement could be reached on these, then these broader questions
                            could easily fall into place. The idea of setting up a continuing forum
                            of Deputy Foreign Ministers was really calculated to give the Soviets a
                            way out—a cover under which they could if they wished drop their
                            proposals or at least allow them to fade away. It was questionable
                            whether the French would agree to participate. The Secretary commented
                            that the French had suggested a tripartite meeting prior to the
                            quadripartite dinner tonight but had been informed that this would not
                            be possible to arrange. The Secretary thought it might serve a useful
                            purpose, from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>’s
                            point of view, to have this bilateral lunch followed without an interim
                            meeting by the quadripartite dinner. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Carstens</persName> indicated agreement that this would be useful
                            in terms of German fears of French ambitions for a tripartite
                            directorate. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> added that
                            the French had said that if the Germans asked them to go ahead at some
                            point and participate in a more formal negotiation with the Russians
                            they would agree to do so. The Secretary commented that the French game
                            at the moment seemed to be to avoid any commitment to any kind of Berlin
                            arrangement which some Germans, some day, might criticize. He thought
                            the French looked even beyond the present German government. Messrs.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> agreed with the Secretary’s
                            analysis. The Secretary then continued to say that it was absolutely
                            fundamental to the US position that there would be no Berlin or German
                            arrangement without the Federal Government’s concurrence. It was
                            conceivable that the European countries could reach some kind of
                            settlement without the United States but it was not conceivable that the
                            United States could reach a settlement without the Europeans.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to the question of the Technical Commissions
                            which the Secretary said we must discuss and work out together. He did
                            not understand why the Federal Government had such a lack of
                            self-confidence about dealing with East Germans. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> replied that if the Federal
                            Government dealt with the East German regime it would strengthen the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and make life even more
                            difficult for the <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0156"/>East German
                            population. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> then
                            commented at some length on the nature of the <persName corresp="#p_UW1"
                                >Ulbricht</persName> regime. He expressed the opinion that a change
                            there to a more liberal regime would be a very important development in
                            the situation. If there were a more “middle-way” regime tensions would
                            relax greatly in Central Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                >Kohler</persName> raised the question, making it clear that he was
                            not challenging that such a change would be a desirable development,
                            whether, however, it would not in fact result in a strengthening of the
                            East German regime, as feared by <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Carstens</persName>, by giving it a greater acceptability to the
                            East Germans. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> agreed that this was
                            an important question. However, on balance the Federal Republic had to
                            consider that the situation would be greatly eased if there were a
                            regime in East Germany which made some kind of “comparative” approach to
                            self-determination so that the population would be content to live there
                            and not persist in attempts to escape. The Foreign Minister then turned
                            to his political problems as a result of the leaks. He pointed out that
                            most of his own party, the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>, as well
                            as the Free Democrats and the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>,
                            entirely supported his position. Only elements of the <gloss
                                target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> were accusing him of having agreed to
                            “concessions.” In reply to the Secretary’s observation that over the
                            past year we had in fact reached no agreement of any kind with the
                            Russians and made no concessions, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> said that the opponents referred to such
                            things as willingness to engage in commitments of nonaggression as
                            “concessions.” Returning to the previous theme, he added that if there
                            were a less oppressive regime in East Germany and a resulting tendency
                            toward easier conditions, he then believed it would be very useful to
                            move toward closer relations between West and East Germany and even
                            toward some rapprochement with Eastern European countries, notably
                            Poland. After citing his conversation with Polish Foreign Minister
                            Rapacki in Geneva,<note n="1" xml:id="d45fn1">A memorandum of <persName

                            say that he thought it would be useful to bring West and East Germans
                            together more. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> observed
                            that the Technical Commissions would not really be the way to do this
                            since there would only be a handful of disciplined Communists on these
                            Commissions from the other side. In this connection he cited German
                            experience under Nazi totalitarianism. He said that even at the time he
                            had concluded there was no way to bring the Nazis down from the inside
                            and that only outside intervention could do this. The Secretary said
                            that from the point of view of long range strategy the more we could
                            develop the contacts of Eastern European countries with the West, the
                            more difficult it would be for the Soviets in <pb n="135"
                                xml:id="pg_135" facs="0157"/>case of war to fight their divisions
                            through these territories. In fact it might take a certain amount of
                            Soviet strength just to maintain order in the Eastern European
                            countries. [<hi rend="italic">3–1/2 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] He added that he thought it would be useful if
                            the Secretary could find some way to suggest to the Russians that it
                            would be in their interest to establish a better regime in Eastern
                            Germany. The Secretary said he had in fact already suggested to
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in Geneva that things
                            were made more difficult by the nature of the <persName corresp="#p_UW1"
                                >Ulbricht</persName> regime.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then turned again to the question of the attitude of Paris.
                            The French had said they would not object to the explorations to see
                            whether negotiations might be possible. Now, however, they were saying
                            that we were getting very near to negotiations but still were not
                            committing themselves. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> commented that he thought at tonight’s meeting
                            the Secretary could not expect to get any comment from Couve on this
                            question until after he, <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                            >Schroeder</persName>, had spoken. He had observed that this was the
                            case in the recent <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Foreign Ministers
                                Meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2">Held April 17 at

                        <p>The meeting then adjourned to the salon. At the Secretary’s request Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> gave the Foreign
                            Minister a rundown on Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH4"
                            >Brentano</persName>’s talks with the President and with himself.<note

                                44</ref>.</note> Some discussion then ensued as to the press
                            treatment of German attitudes. During this Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> observed that the President
                            should not consider the New York Times a German newspaper. On balance he
                            thought that the treatment of this matter by most of the German press,
                            for example the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, had supported the
                            Federal Government’s position. <persName corresp="#p_ME4"

                            had been very successful. In the famous meeting of the political leaders
                                <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> had observed that it was
                            better to have a modus vivendi than a casus belli. He said that for his
                            political position the question of timing was very important as respects
                            some elements of a possible modus vivendi package.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> then returned to the
                            question of communications between the two governments. He again
                            requested that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>
                            be restored as the channel for communications. He assured the Secretary
                            that these communications would be handled on a very limited
                            distribution basis, precisely the same as those obtaining for the Geneva
                            briefings and insisted that the German Embassy in Washington had in no
                            way been responsible for the leak. He then hoped that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> would be dealt with
                            exactly like the French and UK <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0158"
                            />Ambassadors. He referred in this connection to the quadripartite
                            Ambassadorial group and the Secretary observed that it was the French
                            who had disrupted this operation by abstaining from active
                            participation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> then
                            said that having made this appeal for restoration of normal
                            communications, he wanted to inform the Secretary that a general
                            reshuffling of German diplomats was in the offing which would include
                            positions in Washington, Moscow and the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> as well as several other posts. Referring to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>’s remark about the
                            President’s sensitivity to the press, the Secretary observed that the
                            President was a great competitive player and liked to score 100 per
                            cent. He therefore did tend to notice the critical articles more than
                            those which supported him. Moreover he would say frankly that there was
                            some sensitivity in Washington to constant remarks out of Bonn about the
                            good old days of the relationship with his predecessor, <persName>Foster
                                Dulles</persName>. He had known Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> very
                            well himself and knew something of his troubles with the Chancellor.</p>
                        <p>At the close of the discussion it was agreed that both sides would say to
                            the press something along the following lines: The Secretary of State
                            and the German Foreign Minister had met for a full review of the
                            discussions with the Russians and would continue their discussions with
                            the British and French Foreign Ministers this evening. These discussions
                            would of course be reported to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.
                            There was no doubt that further discussions between the US and the USSR
                            would be on a basis of agreed positions which started from the well
                            known and vital interests of the West in West Berlin.<note n="5"

                        </list>
                        <p>I called on <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName> this
                            morning at his request, relayed through Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_LG3">von Lilienfeld</persName>. At first the meeting was
                            to be at <persName corresp="#p_LG3">Lilienfeld</persName>’s house, but
                            later Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> called and
                            said that he would like to have me come to the Embassy and meet with
                            him. On the way to the Eglin Field air demonstration on May 4, I talked
                            with him about it and explained that I would prefer to meet <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH4">Brentano</persName> privately in order to speak
                            very frankly with him about our confidence in <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> and in regular channels. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> agreed, and in turn I agreed to
                            have a private talk with him after talking with <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH4">Brentano</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH4">Brentano</persName> began our talk by making
                            three general statements. First, he hoped that his visit in Washington
                            had been useful, and he wished to express his thanks for the
                            understanding with which he had been received in all parts of
                            Washington, including the White House. He fully recognized that the
                            unhappy leak in Bonn had been damaging, and he agreed with his American
                            friends that such indiscretions could be helpful only to the Soviet
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>Second, he entirely agreed that it was important that there should be
                            negotiations with the Soviet Union. Tensions were so great that none of
                            us could neglect any possibility of lowering them. He further recognized
                            that the U.S. must have and exercise the responsibilities of leadership
                            in such negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Third, he spoke briefly to explain his reservations about the
                            International Access Authority and the mixed commissions. The
                            International Access authority might seem to lessen the ultimate
                            responsibility of the Four Great Powers, and the mixed commissions might
                            be misunderstood in Germany as meaning that the United States had lost
                            its interest in the problem of reunification. Moreover, he thought that
                            serious discussion between West Germans and Communist functionaries was
                            as impossible as serious discussion between the condemned man and the
                            hangman.</p>
                        <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0160"/>
                        <p>I replied to these three headings as follows. First, I agreed that
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Brentano</persName>’s visit had been
                            useful and that the indiscretions in Bonn had been damaging. I pointed
                            out the difficulty of catching up with the damage of such indiscretions,
                            and took the occasion to remark that <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von
                                Brentano</persName>’s private briefing on Tuesday (May 1) showed
                            this difficulty.<note n="1" xml:id="d46fn1">According to <gloss

                                May 1 for 12 U.S. correspondents and broadcasters at which <persName

                                    <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>, had reiterated
                                German concerns about the general U.S. approach and the proposals on
                                access and technical commissions. The telegram concluded that the
                                correspondents were left with the definite impression that there
                                were serious differences between the United States and the Federal
                                Republic. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/5–362)</note>
                            We were convinced that his intention had been to emphasize Allied
                            harmony, but in fact correspondents, alerted to probe for differences,
                            had found some and had been guided accordingly. A still more notable
                            instance of this trouble was <persName corresp="#p_BH4"
                                >Brentano</persName>’s excellent speech to the Press Club which I
                            had heard praised by our own State Department experts and which
                            nevertheless was reported in rather waspish fashion by Murray
                                Marder.<note n="2" xml:id="d46fn2">For text of Marder’s article,
                                which included brief quotations from <persName corresp="#p_BH4"

                                1962.</note> All this trouble could be traced to the original
                            indiscretions in Bonn.</p>
                        <p>Second, I agreed that the United States had the responsibility of
                            leadership and was prepared to exercise it. We also believed in the
                            importance of negotiation, although we had no clear evidence that our
                            current efforts would be successful. We were trying to offer the Soviet
                            Union a quiet way out of the crisis if the Soviet Union was in fact
                            seeking such a result. We thought that perhaps some of the
                            misunderstanding in Bonn derived from a failure to grasp just what our
                            draft papers aimed at. There were many things which we believed that we
                            could not put in a paper designed to attract a Soviet signature. The
                            draft paper therefore described only the small sector in which our
                            position and that of the Soviet Union might overlap. We should find
                            other ways of describing the rest of our position. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH4">Brentano</persName> nodded his clear understanding
                            and agreement to this presentation and said that he thought there had
                            indeed been misunderstanding in Bonn.</p>
                        <p>Third, I disclaimed expert qualifications on the access authority or the
                            technical commissions, but I indicated that, in our judgment, the access
                            authority would not end the ultimate responsibility of the Four Powers.
                            Indeed, I said that I thought in the end there were two Great Powers
                            confronting each other here, and that all pieces of paper would take
                            their meaning in the end from this fundamental fact. As to the technical
                            commissions, I was somewhat more energetic, indicating our own belief
                            that the West Germans should have confidence in their own ability to
                            avoid being trapped by Communist opposite numbers. I recognized that
                            there was a difference of emphasis here, and recalled that the <pb
                                n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0161"/>Chancellor had expressed some
                            worries of his own on this score last year, but I insisted that, in our
                            judgment, these contacts, while not of critical importance, could have
                            an affirmative value in the light of the relative quality and attraction
                            of the Federal Republic as against the puppet Pankow regime.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH4">Brentano</persName> denied that there was a
                            problem of confidence in the German attitude toward the technical
                            commissions, and argued again that such a “doctrine of contacts” might
                            lead some Germans to believe that they must make their own arrangements
                            with the East Germans and eventually with the Soviet Union. If there
                            should ever be talk of reuni-fication by means of neutrality, he,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName>, would prefer to
                            go into exile, and so would most other men in German public life, even
                            among the opposition. The whole of German policy in recent years had
                            been built on the firm connection to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> and the West, and he feared any action which might
                            seem to move away from this line of policy.</p>
                        <p>I remarked that I could see no such danger in the notion of “contacts.” I
                            said that the United States neither could nor would lessen its own
                            interest in the fate of Germany, and that we too had an enormous
                            investment in the solid commitment of the Federal Republic to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the West. This was a keystone of
                            our policy, and we knew that the attitude of the German people
                            themselves was an essential element in this policy. We in our time had
                            heard the arguments in favor of the neutralization of Germany, and able
                            Americans had argued that Germany should be neutralized on the Austrian
                            model. For myself, I thought there was only one thing wrong with such a
                            policy: it would not work. Germany was no Austria, if only because of
                            her size. <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Brentano</persName> nodded his
                            agreement, and I went on to say that I thought Germany and the United
                            States thus shared in the problem of the East German regime. We could
                            not now get rid of it except by war. The Austrian solution was
                            impractical. The Federal Republic must remain a part of the West. What
                            could we expect?</p>
                        <p>I then suggested that the larger arena of relations with the Soviet Union
                            would remain a matter of central concern to the United States, and there
                            remained the possibility of an internal improvement in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. I said that just as we had encouraged
                            and supported a new atmosphere in Poland, we thought it worth working
                            toward a mellowing of the <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>
                            regime. It would be a gain if East Germany could move from <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> toward Gomulka, and it was in
                            this sense that we saw some virtue in contacts. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH4">Brentano</persName> agreed with everything except
                            the last clause of this exposition.</p>

                        <p>After a further exchange of assurances that consultation is good and
                            leaks bad, we parted cordially.<note n="3" xml:id="d46fn3">Following his

                                >Pierre Salinger</persName> arrived in Moscow for a 5-day visit.

                                >Telegram 3071, May 9, transmitted the text of a broadcast by Daniel
                                Schorr that morning that stated that the Chancellor was torpedoing
                                the U.S.-Soviet talks and recited a list of German grievances. The
                                telegram stated that this and other similar statements out of Bonn
                                could only be damaging to the President’s relations with the
                                Chancellor. If the Chancellor had serious reservations about U.S.
                                policy, the President expected “to hear about them directly and not
                                through offensive remarks repeated by journalists.” (Ibid., Central
                                Files, 762.00/5–962)</note> is intended to provide broader framework
                            for your talk with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName>. You may wish to begin by saying that we regret
                            situation which has developed and which has resulted in sensational
                            press treatment and speculation detrimental to our common interests.
                            Both sides need to take stock, to correct misconceptions and to plan
                            course for future which will avoid repetition of events of past few
                            weeks. It is in this spirit that US Government has instructed you to
                            make observations which follow.</p>
                        <p>On Berlin question, we are sending you in separate telegram chronologies
                            relating to consultation on “Principles Paper” and International Access
                            Authority paper.<note n="2" xml:id="d49fn2">Telegram 3095 to Bonn, May
                                12. (Ibid., 762.0221/5–1262)</note> You may wish to draw on these as
                            appropriate to illustrate that process of substantive consultation with
                            Germans has been both continuing and full. In this connection, you may
                            also draw as pertinent on various messages repeated to Bonn reporting on
                            Secretary’s discussions with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Point on consultation leads logically to Chancellor’s alleged feeling, as
                            indicated to General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> in
                            Berlin, that he was badly treated because he had not received reply to
                            his letter of April 14, 1962, to President.<note n="3" xml:id="d49fn3"
                                    ><ref target="#d37">Document 37</ref>.</note> You may wish to
                            note that, upon his return here, General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1"
                                >Clay</persName> had mentioned the Chancellor’s feeling in this
                            matter. You might point out that, on April 15, 1962, Secretary of State
                            discussed telephonically Chancellor’s letter with President, who was in
                            Virginia over Sunday. You were thereafter directed immediately by
                            telephone to communicate to <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> that, while Secretary would go ahead with his
                            scheduled meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            on April 16, he would not put forward any further <pb n="143"
                                xml:id="pg_143" facs="0165"/>paper at this meeting. You might add
                            that while you were unable to reach <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> you did reach Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Carstens</persName> on evening April 15, who said he would inform
                            both Chancellor and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> same evening. In view of this prompt response
                            to Chancellor’s letter which dealt with no other subject, a formal reply
                            was not considered necessary as it was assumed governments would be in
                            touch with each other in continuous consultation on substance of Western
                            position. At almost same time, unfortunate leaks occurred of which we
                            are all too sadly aware and distracted attention from normal
                            consultative process.</p>
                        <p>You should note that we had impression Athens meeting between Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and Secretary
                            of State as well as between four Western Foreign Ministers<note n="4"

                            in good fashion, had cleared up remaining misconceptions and had
                            resulted in large measure of agreement. Consultations in Athens between
                            senior officials of two countries carried forward work on substantive
                            paper, and we are now awaiting through regular diplomatic channels final
                            German response to points worked out at Athens ad referendum. We were,
                            therefore, naturally surprised by press reports and speculations
                            following upon Chancellor’s two press conferences in Berlin which tended
                            to create impression of major differences between us.</p>
                        <p>At this point line of argument set forth in <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1"
                                >Deptel</gloss> 3071 should be presented, but last two sentences of
                            Schorr broadcast should be omitted.</p>
                        <p>You should supplement <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 3071 by
                            emphasizing that continuing reports from Bonn in recent days have
                            carried similar material. You should state as your own view this can
                            only be increasingly irritating to the President and may raise in his
                            mind a question whether German and American understanding is clear as he
                            thought it was in his most satisfactory meeting with the Chancellor last
                            November. You should state that it is this stream of reports of private
                            comments, rather than any particular disagreement over a minor
                            negotiating tactic, that is bound to give the President concern.</p>
                        <p>You should point out as your own observation that Chancellor probably has
                            no idea how many accounts of this kind have been reported by
                            newspapermen, broadcasters, and weekly journalists in recent weeks. If
                            Chancellor should attempt a denial, you should indicate that there are
                            so many of these sources that the President cannot be expected to
                            believe that their accounts are invented. Finally, you should indicate
                            as your own idea that a President who has plenty of important and
                            pressing political problems on all fronts can hardly be expected to look
                            with good humor on hints that these things were all done better by <pb
                                n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0166"/><persName>John Foster
                                Dulles</persName>. It is a principle of this Administration that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> and not
                                <persName>John Foster Dulles</persName> is now in charge of foreign
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>You should then expand on the President’s basic views as you understand
                            them. Beginning after Vienna last June he committed his country to a
                            major military response to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s challenge. 160,000 reserves were called to
                            service; the budget was unbalanced by an additional three and one-half
                            billion dollar defense appropriation, and the United States took the
                            lead in determined preparations to meet all contingencies arising from
                            the Berlin crisis. The response of the US to this crisis far exceeded
                            that of any other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nation, both
                            absolutely and relatively. And as the crisis deepened each moment of
                            real test found the US at the center of responsibility. Every test of
                            will in Berlin has been a test fundamentally for the US, and you may
                            wish to note that each of these tests has been passed, so that in spite
                            of the Wall the self-confidence of Berlin has been essentially restored,
                            as the Chancellor will have seen last week. <gloss target="#t_FYI1"
                                >FYI</gloss>. Our information is that the Berliners are much less
                            troubled with the particular provisions of the International Access
                            Authority than some of those in Bonn. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1"
                                >FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President thus does not understand public or private doubts about the
                            determination of the US and he understands still less any inclination
                            for Germans to say that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> is the only hope; General <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has talked very energetically
                            but has thus far done very little; there are still only 2 French
                            divisions in West Germany. It is American determination and not French
                            rhetoric that is holding the line against Soviet pressure. Moreover, we
                            not only carry the main burden in Berlin but the overwhelming
                            responsibility also for the critical areas of Southeast Asia which are
                            under Communist pressure. Statesmen like the Chancellor, whose principal
                            concern is with the resistance of Communism, should be the first to
                            understand that covert criticism of the US is destructive.</p>
                        <p>Nor does the President understand how there can be an objection at this
                            late date to the diplomatic explorations on Berlin which have been going
                            on. At every stage these have been the subject of intense and careful
                            consultation, and if the Chancellor has been surprised at any point it
                            can only be because he did not fully inform himself of the work of his
                            own government. Thus the President was indeed startled by the
                            Chancellor’s letter of April 14th with its sudden and unexplained
                            request that negotiations be discontinued. What the President did, as
                            the Chancellor knows, was to continue the discussions without putting
                            into them anything that had not long been agreed between our two
                            countries. The US remains determined to continue this close
                            consultation, but the President is glad that the Federal Government now
                            definitely supports further negotiation.</p>

                        <p>The President, in short, is determined to keep on with the double policy
                            of strong military defense and a constant search for an honorable
                            settlement if possible. He fully understands and has repeatedly stated
                            himself that negotiations may not succeed. But he believes the effort
                            must be made.</p>
                        <p>If appropriate opportunity occurs you should also make it clear to the
                            Chancellor that we would be greatly troubled if there were any serious
                            change in his government’s long-stated desire to have Great Britain join
                            the Common Market. Arguments on this point are being sent forward
                                separately,<note n="5" xml:id="d49fn5">Not found.</note> and the
                            President thinks you may wish to press them with the Foreign Secretary
                            and other Bonn officials rather than directly with the Chancellor. But
                            there should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that if Bonn should join Paris
                            in making entry into the Common Market unreasonably difficult, the main
                            responsibility for results will fall on Germany and not on France, with
                            grave consequences to Bonn’s position in the Western alliance.</p>

                                thereto.</note> I had long conversation of about two hours with
                            Chancellor this afternoon. My reception was unusually cordial, with his
                            underlying attitude being one of injured innocence characteristic of
                            child caught with hand in cookie jar. Conversation, though not wholly
                            coherent or consistent, was frankest and most open exchange of views I
                            have ever had with Chancellor, with embarrassing tendency on <pb n="146"
                                xml:id="pg_146" facs="0168"/>his part to deal in personalities.
                            Perhaps most significant element was his desire, explicit and implicit,
                            to re-establish his relationship with the President and the
                            Secretary.</p>
                        <p>Conversation opened by my expression of our regret at situation which had
                            resulted in sensational press treatment and speculation detrimental to
                            common interests, interrupted only by <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName>’s assertion that his answers to queries in
                            Berlin press conference had been misinterpreted. He asked if I had
                            brought to the President’s attention his introductory remarks at this
                            conference; I replied that I had, but that press reports had out-run my
                            own. I then referred to his hurt feelings re lack of reply to his letter
                            of April 14, and recounted circumstances of oral reply; he interjected
                            that <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> had not informed him
                            of this, but he now understood and accepted my explanation.</p>
                        <p>After remarking that the President and the Secretary had thought Athens
                            meeting had cleared up any misconceptions, I read him Schorr’s broadcast
                            from Berlin of May 9 (Chancellor remarked he simply could not understand
                            where responsible journalists got such ideas), and went on to say that
                            more disturbing to us were reports brought to Washington of private
                            conversations critical of American policies and indicating lack of
                            confidence in the administration.</p>
                        <p>Chancellor again expressed unhappiness at lack of press responsibility,
                            and referred to press reports of his comments in Berlin against US entry
                            into European Community; he said these were wholly false. When I
                            suggested that reports of his attitude towards US could not be wholly
                            invented, he remarked that he too had been unhappy at reports and
                            indications from Washington re the President’s impatience with him and
                            with Germans. He reminded me of great satisfaction with US-German
                            relations which he had expressed to me at conclusion of his visit to
                            Washington last November, and turned to Osterheld (who, with
                            interpreter, was only other official present at conversation) for
                            confirmation that just a few days ago he had been thinking of writing
                            private letter to the President regretting what seemed to be cooling of
                            relationship, and asking what could be done to repair situation. “Tell
                            me,” he said, “am I not right in sensing a change in the State
                            Department’s attitude on German matters? <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                >Kohler</persName> has shown himself to be against us, and even
                                <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName>, who knows
                            Germany and whom I remember from his past experience here, seems no
                            longer to understand our position.” I said I could not agree with him,
                            and pointed to full consultation we had had with his government, and to
                            fact that our moves in talks with Soviets had been taken only after
                            Allied agreement. He assented, but without appearing fully to agree with
                            me and went on to remark that what I had said made him feel much better,
                                [<hi rend="italic">8–1/2 lines of source text not

                        <p>I referred once more to private reports of his dissatisfaction with US
                            policy, particularly those subsequent to Athens meeting, but he again
                            evaded issue, saying that perhaps part of problem was lack of precision
                            in diplomatic understanding. He asked if I thought <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Carstens</persName> were less precise in their dealings with us
                            than <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Brentano</persName> had been. I refuted
                            this, although I had to admit there seemed to have been misunderstanding
                            re “principles paper” which was given to Soviets on March 22.</p>
                        <p>Chancellor then read to me from memorandum which he had prepared for
                            Foreign Office commenting on our latest revision of “principles paper,”
                            but which he had not yet sent forward to <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName>, detailing various objections thereto. There
                            were number of recommendations for language changes, and introduction
                            showed reluctance to have paper presented to Soviets yet, but basic
                            objections continued to center on international access authority,
                            non-aggression agreement, and nuclear diffusion ban. On first, I said we
                            were prepared to consider any German proposal which he thought better;
                            on second I said merely I disagreed with Stikker,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d50fn2">Dirk U. Stikker, Secretary General of the North
                                Atlantic Treaty Organization.</note> and third I used to return to
                            theme of <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 3100 and to recite
                            the President’s basic views, his commitment of our resources to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s challenge, and
                            awesome responsibility which led him to continue talks with Soviets
                            while preparing for all contingencies. <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> said, with fervor, that he hoped I would tell
                            the President that he supported this policy fully. He added that during
                            previous US administration, there had been much talk of “co-existence”,
                            but neither side had thought this was possible. It was right, he felt,
                            to hold open possibility of honorable agreement with Soviets, at same
                            time endeavoring to convince them that West would protect its interests
                            (he retailed for me again his conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> in 1955, in which German
                            assistance was asked against both Red China and US).</p>
                        <p>I asked Chancellor if he supported our policy of continuing talks with
                            Soviets. He said yes, entirely, adding that he only hoped we would
                            continue our efforts to bring France along with us. I replied that he
                            could perhaps do more than we, and he referred with evident pleasure to
                            his forthcoming State visit to Paris in July, saying it would be
                            significant event in Franco-German relations, and adding he would
                            continue his efforts with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I then asked <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> if it would
                            be fair to say, in summing up our conversation this afternoon, that he
                            was in agreement with our basic policy on Berlin. He assented readily,
                            and agreed when I said that I assumed we would be hearing shortly from
                            Foreign Office of his detailed objections to revised “principles paper”,
                            although he pointed out again <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0170"
                            />that his memorandum had not yet gone forward to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and there might be changes in
                            it.</p>
                        <p>As final point, I referred again to damages which might be caused by
                            misunderstandings and by public or private criticisms. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> agreed, saying he was grateful
                            for our conversation, that he felt much better about situation, and was
                            now determined to write the President a personal letter in next day or
                            two to explain his position in frank and open terms, and to set out his
                            basic confidence in American policy.</p>

                            his objections to “principles paper” as soon as I can get them from
                            Foreign Office. (I shall press for early date.) In meantime, I shall see
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Brentano</persName> again to ensure his
                            favorable advice to Chancellor. It was he who was largely instrumental
                            in arousing Chancellor’s latent worries, but problem of course is that
                            given <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>’s suspicions and
                            pessimistic nature, it is much easier to awaken his concern than to
                            relieve it.</p>
                        <p>Second and more important factor is prospect for further damage which
                            Chancellor’s State visit to Paris will afford. I hope I achieved some
                            result this afternoon, but I have no illusion that my persuasions <pb
                                n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0171"/>will equal those of <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. Further inoculation is
                            needed, and I can think of no safer treatment than another visit to
                            Washington, which might easily come about as an outgrowth of
                            correspondence which <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> says
                            he is initiating. If a pretext is needed, I would think an honorary
                            degree could be arranged, and I have little doubt that the Chancellor
                            would accept your invitation for a personal talk.</p>

                        <p>On May 15 General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Lucius D. Clay</persName>,
                            the President’s Special Representative in Berlin, testified before the
                            Senate Foreign Relations Committee on his tour in the city and
                            Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>’s concern
                            about U.S. policy in Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName>
                            stated that the confidence of West Berliners had largely returned after
                            the building of the wall and that there would be an interlude of
                            indeterminate length in Soviet harassment of the city. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> then reported that the Chancellor
                            had two fears, neither of which <persName corresp="#p_CLD1"
                                >Clay</persName> believed was shared by the German people: 1)
                            transfer of authority to an international access authority which would
                            void Western responsibility if there were a crisis, and 2) a degree of
                            recognition of the German Democratic Republic. For text of his testimony

                        <p>“Dear Mr. Chancellor:</p>
                        <p>I have just read Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1"
                                >Dowling</persName>’s report of his meeting with you,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d53fn2"><ref target="#d50">Document 50</ref>.</note> and I
                            write to say simply that I am very glad of this good beginning in
                            getting our relations back where they were in November. I am sure that
                            as long as we can keep in this kind of touch directly and through our
                            trusted advisers we shall be all right. I want to say, too, that I
                            personally regret that my failure to give a formal answer to your letter
                            of April 14th gave you concern. I did send a prompt oral response, which
                            was necessary because I was out of town, and because a meeting with the
                            Soviet Ambassador had been scheduled for the very next day—but a letter
                            should have followed; our relations to each other are too important to
                            be marred by such matters.</p>
                        <p>In the same spirit let me say that I am sure the impression you formed of
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>’s message to
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> was the
                            result of an unhappy accident in the meaning of words in our two
                            languages. I believe we are both very well served by our loyal and able
                            Foreign Ministers, and for that matter by their professional staffs.
                            They are trying to keep us together, and we must not be hard on
                            them.</p>
                        <p>I am glad that you are giving your close personal attention to the papers
                            now under discussion between our two governments, and we shall look
                            forward to hearing your views. As I see the matter, our agreements
                            greatly outweigh our differences, and we have time enough to work out a
                            clear position before any paper goes on to the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, I think it is very clear that we shall all gain greatly
                            if we can get this Berlin crisis moderated in a fashion that honorably
                            protects both the people of Berlin and our own interests. We doubt if
                            there is any prospect of a real settlement with the Soviets, but we do
                            think there is a chance of getting this three-and-a-half-year-old crisis
                            cooled off by an arrangement that centers on the very few things both
                            sides can say in <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0173"/>the same
                            language. Our tactical purpose is to test this possibility—and to do it
                            in a way which continues to protect our common interests—while proving
                            to all concerned that a decent solution is possible whenever the Soviets
                            are ready to accept it.</p>
                        <p>With warmest good wishes and with thanks again for your courtesy to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName>. Sincerely,

                            ahead in our exploratory discussions with the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>And as soon as there is some indication of Soviet give in this matter, we
                            can make a significant move on the question of “respect for <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty”, indicating a readiness to
                            accept a <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> presence at the access
                            control points. These would be the essential elements of the “deal”,
                            with the non-aggression and non-diffusion commitments added.</p>
                        <p>You talked yesterday about a possible change in nomenclature for the
                            Western forces such as “police forces”, which might make our military
                            presence saleable to the Soviets. I am not aware of any indication that
                            a police force would be more acceptable to the Soviets than a military
                            force unless this was suggested by <persName corresp="#p_SPEG1"
                                >Salinger</persName> in his Moscow talks. However, in his comments
                            to <persName corresp="#p_CG5">Gardner Cowles</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> did say “Western troops must
                            leave Berlin or at least give up their occupation status”, which I took
                            to mean that some formula which removed the words “occupation forces”
                            might be acceptable. We could explore this possibility with the Soviets
                            once we had some indication that they were prepared to live with our
                            forces in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>As for tactics, the consensus of <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1"
                                >Hillenbrand</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_OHD1">Owen</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KD4">Klein</persName> was that we should avoid
                            tabling papers; attempt for the time being to get German agreement on
                            the substance of the revised Draft Principles Paper; and let the
                            Secretary present to the Soviets orally what the Germans have agreed to
                            substantively, with the Secretary improvising the orchestration as he
                            goes along.</p>
                        <p>A new paper might be needed later. For the present however we should
                            avoid new documents, and eliminate the interminable debate with our
                            Allies over words, phrases and punctuation.</p>
                        <p>German agreement to the present draft of the Principles Paper should give
                            us sufficient license to move ahead with the <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> dialogue. And this would be consistent with the
                            President’s commitment to <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>
                            on the question of consultation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_OHD1">Henry</persName> again suggested an early
                            offer to the Soviets of accepting the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> at the check points. After some discussion, it was
                            agreed that this might be in order but only after two or three more
                            rounds with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, and
                            provided <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> gave some
                            indication of give in the Soviet position on the Western military
                            presence in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>As for transforming the character of the talks—by shifting their level
                            and locus—and perhaps letting <persName corresp="#p_BCE2"
                                >Bohlen</persName> and/or <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"

                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> away from the Department, the
                            consensus was that this would be useful, but only after the Secretary
                            made progress in nailing down the principal points under discussion.</p>
                        <p>The immediate task then is to establish Soviet intentions, to ascertain
                            whether serious negotiations are possible. And if there appears to <pb

                            we should set down the principal elements of an acceptable arrangement
                            along the general lines of the proposed Draft Principles.</p>
                        <p>Allied consultation remains a tricky problem. In view of the experience
                            of the last few weeks, however, the general feeling is that some of the
                            difficulty might be avoided if there were fewer papers tabled and
                            greater reliance placed on oral explanations with the Soviets.</p>

                                            revised “principles paper”, embodying, in effect, our
                                            fallback positions, and stressing that, if the Soviets

                                        <item>To start with the assumption that the experience of
                                            the past month has shown that the U.S. cannot conduct
                                            exploratory talks with the Soviets in a useful way and
                                            at the same time observe the amenities of conventional
                                            consultation with our Allies. We might, therefore, try
                                            to put our contacts with the Soviets on an even more
                                            private and confidential basis, without consulting our
                                            Allies in advance or from meeting to meeting. We would
                                            make it clear to the Soviets that any proposals advanced
                                            or discussed were entirely provisional without any
                                            commitment on our part or that of our Allies. Only if
                                            there seemed to be a real prospect of agreement with the
                                            Soviets along lines which might have been developed in

                                    out, and that the Soviets would ineluctably move ahead within
                                    the near future to take the unilateral action which they have
                                    threatened, unless some dramatic Western gesture of this sort
                                    were made. This does not seem to be the case. Ambassador

                                    believes it unlikely that the Soviets will pay our price for a
                                    real Berlin solution and that the present “neither peace nor
                                    war” situation will continue. After an effort at some sort of a

                                    concessions without any indication of give in the Soviet
                                    position, would be a debatable negotiating tactic. The Soviets
                                    would be unlikely to be impressed by U.S. statements that this
                                    was the ultimate in concessions, and it is not clear precisely
                                    what the alternative course of action for the U.S. would be if
                                    the Soviets did not accept these concessions and we were then
                                    forced to carry out our threat to cut off discussions with the
                                    Soviets on the “principles paper”. Such a statement of purpose
                                    on the part of the U.S. may become desirable at some point in
                                    the discussions, but it does not seem to have been reached at

                                    our Allies, following the procedures suggested in 1(e). This
                                    latter might, of course, also be used for a more leisurely
                                    approach. The difficulty with 1(e) is that it leaves us at the
                                    mercy of the Soviets. By leaking out the contents of such
                                    “private” discussions, they could completely foul up our
                                    relations with our Allies and bring about a real rather than a
                                    synthetic crisis of confidence. Soviet bad faith apart, it is
                                    difficult to believe that talks could actually be carried on
                                    without becoming known to our Allies. The pressures therefore
                                    for information would be difficult to resist.</item>

                                <item>As to the substance of our position, we should shortly have
                                    the German comments on the “principles paper” discussed at
                                    Athens. These may or may not be helpful, but under the
                                    circumstances we would presumably have more flexibility orally
                                    than in trying to put in a new paper. Two revisions of the
                                    International Access Authority paper have been prepared as the
                                    U.S. side—one attempts to adapt the Soviet version presented to
                                    us in Geneva; the other attempts to adapt our version by
                                    incorporating a number of Soviet suggestions. Since the main
                                    German objection was to the make-up of the Board of Governors,
                                    and since neither of these versions takes care of this point, it
                                    would seem desirable to await the German comments on the old
                                    paper which they have promised before floating the new
                                        versions.<note n="4" xml:id="d54fn4">On May 22 <persName

                        <p>1. I now have a little information on yesterday’s meeting which was
                            supposed to have addressed the alternative “next steps on Berlin” which
                            appear in the attached paper.<note n="2" xml:id="d55fn2">Attachment to

                            that the meeting was more or less of a complete fiasco. The President
                            had his mind on something else and apparently had not read the paper
                            very carefully. In the second place, the Secretary of State
                            unfortunately had not done his homework either. This left Mr. <persName

                            said, seems to have a capacity for saying the right thing at the wrong
                            time. In short, the meeting appears to have accomplished nothing
                            whatever.</p>

                                >Ball</persName> left Washington for a trip to Copenhagen,
                            Stockholm, Paris, and Rome to discuss economic matters. On May 21
                            Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> cabled him
                            at Rome, asking him to detour from his itinerary and stop at Bonn for

                            visit was to assist in the restoration of U.S. relations with Germany so
                            that the broad interests which both countries had in Berlin and Europe
                            could “be <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0179"/>dealt with on their

                                >Ball</persName> would “undoubtedly not wish to discuss details of

                            pleased that relations between the United States and Germany had been
                            restored to a “harmonious basis.” The Chancellor replied that he too was
                            pleased that good relations had been restored, “adding he had been
                            upset, not so much personally as officially,” because of the importance
                            of the questions to be dealt with. He stated that he regarded the
                            chapter as closed. (Telegram 2858 from Bonn, May 23; ibid.,

                            apparently under impression US is engaged in definitive attempt to
                            settle problem of Germany. This may be among Soviet objectives as
                            embodied in their concept of drawing line under World War II, but US is
                            under no illusions on this point. Our position remains, as it has always
                            been, that only lasting solution to German and Berlin problems would be
                            reunification of country in freedom with reunited Berlin as capital of
                            this unified Germany. We are also realistic enough to recognize that
                            this goal is unlikely to be achieved in foreseeable <pb n="158"

                        <p>What we are trying to deal with is factual situation, one of ingredients
                            of which is capacity of Soviets to sign separate peace treaty with
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and to refuse any longer to
                            carry out their responsibilities towards Western Occupation Powers in
                            Berlin. As one of powers principally concerned in involved discussions
                            of this subject since <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            first precipitated Berlin crisis in November, 1958, French Government
                            should be very well aware that reasonable Western response to this
                            Soviet threat must be first to try to prevent such unilateral action by
                            Soviets, but if this cannot be done, to attempt in advance to achieve

                            suggested by Germans themselves) to improve de facto situation for

                            necessarily result in de facto deterioration of Berlin situation. On

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I thank you sincerely
                            for your letter of May 15, 1962.<note n="1" xml:id="d58fn1">See <ref
                                    target="#d53">Document 53</ref>.</note> I share your view that
                            we cannot afford letting our cooperation be disturbed by
                            misunderstandings out of all proportion to the difficult tasks before
                            us. I also concur with you that the differences between us are much less
                            than the agreements and that there is time enough to work out a clear
                            cut position before a paper is presented to the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>No one could feel greater satisfaction than I myself, my government and
                            the German people if it were possible to settle the Berlin crisis—which
                            has been smouldering for years—without our common interests being
                            harmed. I agree with you that to this end every possibility must be
                            conscientiously explored and that it is advisable to make clear to the
                                <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0182"/>world that an honorable
                            solution is possible as soon as the Soviets are prepared to accept
                            it.</p>
                        <p>I believe that we will reach a consensus on the most suitable methods to
                            achieve this object. Certainly, we, on our part, will need firmness and
                            patience and we will not be able to make many new proposals to the
                            Soviets. One of these new possibilities to continue the talks with the
                            Soviets I had conveyed through Federal Minister Schroder to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> at the Athens meeting. On
                            some questions, we are quite prepared to talk if the Soviets were ready
                            to allow more humane conditions to be created in the Soviet occupation
                            zone.</p>
                        <p>I am told that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> is
                            considering a visit to Bonn during the second half of June. I would
                            warmly welcome the realization of this plan and I believe that,
                            particularly during the present phase, frequent and intimate discussions
                            between our two governments are most useful.</p>

                        <p>After an initial exchange of pleasantries, the Secretary noted that the
                            fact that he had asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> to come in on an American national holiday had
                            no special significance. He also pointed out, with reference to press
                            reports about problems with our Allies, that these do not concern basic
                            matters and thus were not related to the present discussion. One point
                            discussed with our Allies involved something which Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had already rejected in his
                            discussion with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPEG1">Salinger</persName>,
                            namely, the composition of the Access Authority. The real issue is the
                            central problem of our vital interests in Berlin, and this is between us
                            and Moscow and not between the Western Allies.</p>
                        <p>After noting that the views of Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> as expressed to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPEG1">Salinger</persName> had been fully reported to
                            the President, the Secretary observed that nearly a year had gone by
                            since the Vienna meeting between Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName>. During this year a considerable number of talks
                            had been held with the Soviet Union and various things had happened.
                            Both sides seem to consider that these talks had been useful in
                            clarifying respective points of view. However, we could not see that
                            much real progress had been made. During this period two things have
                            happened: (a) There had been a certain change in the de facto situation
                            with the construction of the wall and the further incorporation of East
                            Berlin into East Germany. We did not like these <pb n="162"
                                xml:id="pg_162" facs="0184"/>because they were contrary to
                            four-power agreements, but taking account of the interests of both sides
                            and the problem which East Germany constitutes for the Soviets, we did
                            not do anything about them.</p>
                        <p>(b) In the talks with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> last fall, and subsequently, there has been
                            mention of so-called broader questions. We had noted that, in regard to
                            these, there seemed to be no real difficulty in coming to some sort of
                            agreement and that they would fall into place if the central question of
                            Berlin could be resolved. We did not find, however, any corresponding
                            effort on the part of Moscow to take account of our vital interests. We
                            have noted, for example, recent statements made in East Germany that
                            agreement had been reached on a number of points such as nuclear
                            non-diffusion, boundaries, and a non-aggression agreement between the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Warsaw Pact countries as
                            if these were assured points to be stored away in the refrigerator. At
                            the same time the Soviet Union’s insistence on its original position
                            with respect to West Berlin seems to be maintained.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wanted to emphasize here that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> at Vienna had made completely
                            clear that our commitments to West Berlin must be maintained. We could
                            not accept the effects which a failure to do so would have on ourselves
                            and the rest of the free world. A diminution of our position was not
                            tolerable while, at the same time, the Soviets were consolidating their
                            position in Germany. At Vienna, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> spelled out in considerable detail the
                            relationship between West Berlin and US vital interests.He said that he
                            had gained the impression that the USSR was presenting him with the
                            alternatives either of accepting the Soviet position on Berlin or having
                            a face-to-face confrontation. This led him to remark at one point that
                            it appeared we were going to have a very cold winter, because a
                            diminution of our position in West Berlin was simply not acceptable.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that the Soviet Union had advanced various formulae
                            as a substitute for the Western troop presence: <list>
                                <label>a.</label>

                                    a period of three to five years.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>These were simply variations of proposals that would eliminate the US in
                            West Berlin, or reduce our position, and thus have the effect which
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> had mentioned
                            at Vienna.</p>
                        <p>We believe that both sides, the Secretary continued, have a serious
                            rational interest in avoiding a head-on conflict over Berlin. It would
                            be dangerous for the two sides to come to the table, with one thinking
                            that <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0185"/>under no circumstances
                            would the other fight over Berlin. This might lead to the one side’s
                            passing beyond the limits of toleration. It was, of course, true that
                            war was irrational, but other things were also irrational, such as
                            failing to meet our elementary commitments. We were thus trying to talk
                            out with the Soviet Government how this situation could be handled. On
                            the basis of what had been said so far, it did not seem likely that any
                            agreement could be reached on a permanent settlement of the German
                            question. We believed that any settlement which did not rest on the
                            basic attitudes and wishes of the German people was unlikely to be
                            permanent. There were grave disadvantages in trying to make a lasting
                            arrangement which would merely stimulate the worst aspects of German
                            nationalism and unsettle central Europe. We have not pressed for such a
                            permanent settlement because we saw no real prospect of agreement, given
                            the Soviet position. If we were wrong in this judgment, we would be
                            willing to look again.</p>
                        <p>It would also be possible, the Secretary went on, to proceed on the basis
                            of the factual situation, provided that all facts of the situation are
                            taken into account, not only those facts which satisfy the Soviets. Two
                            facts are: that Germany is not united and that the West is in West
                            Berlin. We see no reason why the situation could not be stabilized on
                            the basis of these facts pending an eventual permanent settlement. There
                            is nothing more abnormal in the Western presence in West Berlin than in
                            any other aspect of the German situation. We would regret it if the
                            geographic situation of West Berlin created any illusions. We are there
                            and have a basic right to be there. We have not been able to put much
                            content into the Soviet demand that our position in West Berlin be
                            reduced or eliminated. It is not realistic to talk about West Berlin as
                            a military base. The Soviet military would not pretend this to be true,
                            surrounded as West Berlin is by many Soviet divisions. Our troops are
                            there for the political purpose of underlining and demonstrating our
                            commitment to the city. They are in no position to take aggressive
                            action against anyone. We have heard the phrase frequently repeated by
                            the Soviets that it is necessary to draw a line under World War II. If,
                            in translation, this means the time had come to remove the West from
                            West Berlin, this is something we could not accept. The time has not
                            come for that. If we are unable to agree on a permanent settlement, and
                            apparently so far on the factual situation, what is to be done? We have
                            said that we are willing to proceed on the basis of existing facts, the
                            Secretary pointed out, and also to take account of a number of other
                            matters in which the Soviets and we have expressed some interest but
                            which are not directly connected with Berlin. However, in our dealings
                            with our Allies and our own people, we are unable to point to
                            practically anything indicating that Moscow has made any effort to take
                            our vital interests into account. We require a greater degree of
                            reciprocity in these conversations. We cannot accept as <pb n="164"
                                xml:id="pg_164" facs="0186"/>a concession a mere reformulation of
                            demands which amounts to the same thing, that is the reduction or
                            elimination of the U.S. position in West Berlin. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> has more than once said that it
                            is not compatible with the relationship between great powers for one to
                            say that “What is mine is mine, and what is yours is negotiable.” We
                            consider, therefore, that there must be a greater degree of recognition
                            that U.S. vital interests are involved in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador would recall, the Secretary continued, that in an earlier
                            meeting between them as well as at Geneva, we had suggested a framework
                            within which we thought these discussions might profitably proceed. We
                            had reduced this to a paper which might be called a modus vivendi,
                            although the title was of secondary importance. We thought that this
                            provided a way of handling how our disputes with the Soviets might be
                            resolved. We had tried to avoid having either side subscribe to points
                            which were publicly known to be contrary to the positions of either
                            side. We have said that we cannot recognize the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>. When Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                                >Thompson</persName> said this to Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, the latter responded that we
                            already did recognize the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. It was
                            true that we were prepared to act on the basis that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is there. We do not pretend it does not
                            exist, nor do our Allies. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> has
                            trade offices in eleven Western countries and there are substantial
                            trade relations between West and East Germany. We have tried to leave
                            out of our paper points the acceptance of which would require either
                            side to change its basic position. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had said to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPEG1"
                                >Salinger</persName> that the Soviets would not recognize any right
                            of the West to maintain troops in West Berlin. In our modus vivendi
                            paper we did not ask that this be recognized, since this did not require
                            recognition by the Soviets. We are there and not by any right granted by
                            the Soviets, but for reasons which are well understood. Our modus
                            vivendi paper was silent on this point. The paper left open the way, if
                            the Soviets felt it to be necessary in the light of their public
                            commitments to sign some agreement with the East Germans, for them to do
                            so. It was not the signing of such an agreement which was of concern to
                            us, but rather the practical consequences which it purported to have on
                            our position in West Berlin. There was no way by which one-sided
                            arrangements between Moscow and Pankow could affect our rights and
                            positions in West Berlin, but the practical consequences of such an
                            arrangement were important to us. We had supposed that, in a modus
                            vivendi, certain points of agreement might be registered and others put
                            into a process of discussion which would open the way to their solution
                            by peaceful means. This might take some time, but time was less
                            dangerous and expensive than haste if the latter were to involve a
                            direct confrontation of the kind threatened over Berlin. We did not
                            attach great importance to the precise wording of such a modus vivendi.
                            There seemed to have been some confusion at Geneva as to precisely <pb
                                n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0187"/>what we had in mind with our
                            paper. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had handed us a
                            working paper embodying the standard Soviet positions. This was not a
                            paper designed to deal with the question of how we handled disagreement,
                            but was a record of the elements which were disagreed and embodied in
                            the Soviet position. Our paper was intended for another purpose: how to
                            manage disagreement. It did not mention such matters as the Western
                            occupation status or an all-Berlin solution, which would have been
                            included in any full exposition of the Western point of view.</p>
                        <p>We consider, therefore, the Secretary went on, that our two Governments
                            should think carefully about how they should deal with these matters and
                            in which direction the discussions could be moved forward. We did not
                            ask for a piece of paper recognizing our position in West Berlin. We are
                            there. It ought to be possible to discuss and clarify some arrangements
                            on access. The Secretary noted that he had said before that there was no
                            inherent contradiction between free access and the authority of the East
                            Germans in carrying out their responsibilities. This did not appear to
                            be an insuperable problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he thought there might be an advantage in trying to
                            find even some small point on which an advance could be made. This might
                            be to devise some means to reduce the sense of tension existing in
                            Berlin, which registered itself on both sides of the wall. Families were
                            divided and could not visit each other and the flow of normal trade was
                            made more difficult. Operation of the normal facilities of the city
                            could best be worked out by arrangements between those responsible for
                            the two sides of Berlin. We were interested in the possibility of
                            increasing the well-being of the people of Berlin by facilitating their
                            ability to work, to visit with each other, and to enjoy the cultural
                            opportunities on both sides of the city. We could understand that the
                            free flow of refugees that had previously taken place created great
                            problems for the Soviets and the East Germans. It had never been our
                            policy or that of the Federal Republic to stimulate this. When the
                            refugees arrived in West Berlin we did what we could for them,
                            consistent with our traditions. We did not consider it in our interest
                            to have the flow proceed on the scale on which it proceeded. Without
                            getting into the question of this kind of movement, we would like to see
                            an improvement in the interchange between West and East Berlin. The
                            Secretary then suggested a formula for the execution of an all-Berlin
                            technical commission contained in the attachment to this memorandum of
                            conversation, a copy of which he gave to Dobrynin at a slightly later
                            point in the conversation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would like to add some comments on one or two other
                            problems affecting the general situation. We did not fully understand
                            why there seems to have been a tightening up of the situation. From our
                            point of view, this seems to have been coming from the East, not from
                            the attitudes or hopes of the West in these matters. Organically, <pb
                                n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0188"/>there was no connection between
                            Berlin and disarmament negotiations, but in the broadest political sense
                            it was inevitable that these matters should influence each other. A
                            crisis over Berlin would obviously have the gravest implications for
                            disarmament. If there were movement on the one, there could be movement
                            on the other in the sense that there would be mutual reinforcement for
                            the effort to bring about normalization and reduction of tensions.</p>

                        <p>Resuming the general discussion, the Secretary stated that there was need
                            to give serious thought to the broadest direction of our respective
                            policies. In a period where Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> would have responsibilities for the policies of
                            their two countries, they would have a chance to decide matters of the
                            greatest importance. These would involve whether the two great social
                            systems represented would be able to work out their long-range
                            relationships leading to a normal relationship between states. On
                            ideological grounds this did not appear easy, but on practical grounds
                            and in terms of the interests of the two and of the countries associated
                            with them the problem did not appear to be insuperable. However, the
                            Eastern side must recognize and take account of what the other side
                            considers its vital interests, and not merely of what it thought the
                            vital interests of the other side ought to be. The possibilities ahead
                            for a more normal relationship were very great, just as the tensions and
                            dangers of an opposite course of action would be very great. If the
                            latter development ensued, it would be cold comfort to know that so much
                            history depended on these two countries.</p>
                        <p>On the subject of Berlin, the Secretary noted we had made an immediate
                            suggestion regarding an establishment of an all-Berlin technical
                            commission. We also hoped that the Soviet Government would try to review
                            its position carefully in an effort to find a basis on which these
                            questions could be taken up with better reciprocity. It was not a good
                            situation to have the President report to the U.S. people and our allied
                            leaders report to their people, that, despite the building of the wall,
                            the absorption of East Berlin and the discussion of certain other broad
                            points on which agreement might possibly be found, on matters of direct
                            major concern to us, there was nothing to show that Moscow was
                            interested in moving towards a settlement. We also hoped, the Secretary
                            added, that the Soviets would give further attention to our modus
                            vivendi paper looking at it as a possible means of handling the
                            situation of disagreement.</p>
                        <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0189"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether
                            the formula which the Secretary had handed him on the all-Berlin
                            technical commission was intended as a response to the paper given the
                            Secretary by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at Geneva.
                            The Secretary said our modus vivendi paper, given to <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at Geneva, was intended as our
                            effort to deal with the general situation as we saw it, which we did not
                            feel, for reasons already indicated, his principles paper adequately
                            did. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that what the
                            Secretary had mentioned today had already been discussed with <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and contained nothing
                            essentially new. His understanding had been that there would be a reply
                            to the <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> paper on certain
                            points. His impression had been that now was the time to obtain this
                            reply. Or did the Secretary not feel free to discuss the <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> paper, but instead wished to
                            make different points? The Secretary observed that he had not supposed
                            from the Geneva discussions that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> expected a written reply to his paper. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said it was not a question of
                            a written reply, but of a reply. The Secretary commented that, from his
                            talks with him, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> could
                            identify those points which created the main difficulties between us. If
                            he wanted comments in an informal working paper on his informal working
                            paper, this could be considered. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> had proposed a point-by-point discussion of his
                            paper, but now the Secretary was suggesting a different approach. The
                            Secretary pointed out that the purposes of the two papers had been
                            different. Recalling the content of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>’s paper at Geneva, he did not believe we could
                            carry any discussion very far without a greater element of reciprocity
                            on the part of the Soviets. He did not see enough readiness to take
                            account of our vital interests to promise that any discussion of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> paper would be
                            profitable. Our paper was intended to advance the process of
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had been interested in one formulation of Chairman
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPEG1">Salinger</persName>. He had said that the Soviets
                            could not recognize the right of the Western powers to maintain troops
                            in West Berlin. If this were analogous to our statement that we could
                            not recognize the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, that was one
                            thing. In the context of the other remarks made by Chairman <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, we assumed that there was
                            no significance to this formulation, but if there were, we would be glad
                            to know about it. That would open up further possibilities.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the German question as a whole, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stated, there were certain
                            positive facts. The Soviets did attach some importance to the fact that
                            exchanges on these matters were now going on. A peace settlement and a
                            Berlin settlement were of great importance to the Soviet Union, which
                            had fought together with the Western powers against Germany and had
                            suffered much. The Soviet Union now wanted to draw a line under World
                            War II. It was not trying to gain anything from the United States. What
                            was desired was a recognition of the <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168"
                                facs="0190"/>situation existing in Germany, that is the existence of
                            two German states. During the War the U.S. and the Soviet Union had been
                            allies, and had had the same aim of eliminating the Hitlerite aggressive
                            forces. But now, the troops of the two countries have different aims.
                            They were not allies any more. U.S. troops were in West Berlin not just
                            as occupation troops, but as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            troops. He was not speaking of the number of such troops, but of the
                            fact that they were still there to fight the Soviets and against Soviet
                            interests. It was, therefore, better to lessen tensions and to settle
                            this matter so that relations between the Soviet Union and the U.S.
                            could be improved. Clearly, the Soviet Union wanted to have good
                            relations with the United States, but certain circles in West Germany
                            wanted the two countries to clash. Otherwise, their “Great German”
                            schemes could not be carried out. The Soviet Union was not interested in
                            such a clash. In response to the Secretary’s query as to who precisely
                            in West Germany wanted such a clash, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that many people demanded the restoration
                            of the German borders as before, and he was sure the Secretary knew who
                            they were as well as he did. Such a restoration could not be obtained
                            without U.S. assistance; hence they wanted a clash between the Soviet
                            Union and the U.S. A settlement of the situation in West Berlin would be
                            good for both countries. If this could not be obtained, then we might
                            come to the point where we would be confronted by a great test. The
                            Soviet Union was trying to avoid this and to seek a solution. If one
                            were to take the substance of the Secretary’s statement, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> continued, and what is being
                            discussed in the West German press, what the Western powers were trying
                            to do was to find a settlement of the German and West Berlin problem
                            within the framework of the old occupation situation, and without taking
                            account of the new situation in the world and in Europe. The Secretary
                            asked what he meant by the “new situation.” <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> responded the war has been over for more than
                            17 years, and we could not live forever in a state of war. It was
                            necessary to draw a line under World War II in a legal sense. The Soviet
                            Union wanted to legalize the situation of peace. Whether one liked it or
                            not, there were two Germanies. The Secretary commented that when we talk
                            of the fact of the two Germanies, we also must say that our presence in
                            West Berlin and free access thereto are facts.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the general
                            line of the Western approach was very clear; it was an open secret which
                            could be read in the papers. The substance of the West German proposals
                            as they had appeared in the press had the intention of spreading the
                            occupation rights existing in West Berlin to the communications between
                            West Berlin and the outside world. They wanted to continue four-power
                            responsibility, but what responsibility did the four powers have?
                            Ninety-five per cent of all traffic to West Berlin was the
                            responsibility of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Five per cent
                            was controlled by the Soviets under agreement with the East Germans.
                            When <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0191"/>the peace treaty was
                            signed the Soviet Union would give that five per cent back to the East
                            Germans. It could not be said that even now there was any four-power
                            responsibility for access. The Secretary said he could not accept such a
                            formulation. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> observed
                            that the Secretary had spoken of facts. It was a fact that ninety-five
                            per cent of all traffic to West Berlin was now the responsibility of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The Soviets had felt that it
                            was a good idea, after the Geneva discussions, for him (<persName

                            proceed with the positive points which had been discussed with <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, but now three or four meetings
                            had taken place in Washington and “we had not made a single move.” The
                            Secretary commented that he was glad that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> had said “we.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stated that in the
                            respective positions of the two countries there were certain things in
                            common which could be settled without too much difficulty. However, as
                            Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had said to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPEG1">Salinger</persName>, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and he to the Secretary, all
                            these questions could be easily solved, but only if there were a
                            settlement of the main question—liquidation of the occupation regime in
                            West Berlin. He referred to the fact that the Secretary had many times
                            raised the question of guarantees of access. The Soviets had accepted
                            the idea of an arbitration body or board. This had been a move on their
                            part, after the President had first raised the subject of an access
                            authority with <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>. The
                            Soviets were ready to discuss this but they could only accept the idea
                            if there were agreement on the main point—ending the occupation regime
                            in West Berlin. When speaking of an access authority, the Soviets had
                            always made it clear this was not a control organ over access, for the
                            access routes go through the sovereign territory of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, which has the only real right to
                            exercise the right of a sovereign state within its sovereign territory.
                            It was difficult to expect that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            and the Soviets would agree to give rights which already belong to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to an international body. When
                            the peace treaty was signed, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            would have all its sovereign rights over access. The Soviet Government
                            was not prepared to discuss suggestions aimed at strengthening the
                            remnants of the occupation regime instead of its liquidation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> noted that the so-called West
                            German proposals had not been discussed, but as these had appeared in
                            the press, they were completely unacceptable to the Soviet Union which
                            was unwilling to consider anything aimed at strengthening the occupation
                            regime. The Soviet Union still hoped that an agreement could be reached
                            on West Berlin and a German peace settlement. It felt that there was a
                            possibility of ending the occupation regime without inflicting moral
                            damage on the U.S. or Soviet Governments. They could declare to their
                            people that they had come to an agreement directed at achieving closer
                            relations between both countries. He, therefore, had to say that while
                            there was some glimmering of hope for an agreement, his <pb n="170"
                                xml:id="pg_170" facs="0192"/>Government could not accept the
                            maintenance of occupation rights in West Berlin, and his Government
                            could not agree on a settlement without a settlement of this question.
                            As Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had said,
                            this was the test of relations and if agreement were not reached, then a
                            serious situation would result. “The key was in your hands.”</p>
                        <p>Reviewing his notes, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            observed that the Secretary had today merely repeated once more what he
                            had said to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. The
                            Secretary said that he had suggested that the Soviet Foreign Minister
                            come back to our Geneva suggestion and take a new look at this method of
                            handling the problem. Paging through his notes, Dobrynin observed that
                            the Secretary had mentioned U.S. relations with its Allies. The Soviet
                            Union did not try to influence these relations and at their last meeting
                            on April 27 the Secretary had said he was going to Athens to exchange
                            views with his Allies. Did the Secretary’s remarks reflect this exchange
                            of views? The Secretary responded that there was no problem at the
                            moment of any importance between the Allies affecting this discussion.
                            The central problem is what <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> had called the central problem.</p>
                        <p>Changing the subject again, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that, with reference to <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> recognition, the Soviet Union did not
                            ask formal recognition, but recognition of the sovereignty of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and that it must enjoy all sovereign
                            powers within the limits of international law. The Soviet Union would
                            like to sign a peace treaty after reaching an agreement with the Western
                            powers and then put this agreement into the peace treaty.</p>
                        <p>As to the all-Berlin technical commission, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> continued, this was not a main issue between
                            the Soviet Union and the U.S. This was a matter for the Germans to
                            discuss among themselves. It was their business. If they wanted
                            something of this sort, the Soviet Union would be prepared to help. It
                            was not its job. As far as the wall was concerned, he added, the Soviet
                            Union had no authority to discuss this matter on behalf of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> Government and it was not a proper
                            subject for discussion with the Secretary.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stated that his
                            Government likewise felt the seriousness of developments in other areas.
                            The Secretary was aware of how the disarmament situation stood. The two
                            countries agreed on one thing, namely that the security of both
                            countries had to be respected. The basic concept was that when the first
                            stage of disarmament had been completed, there would be no relationship
                            of advantage or disadvantage and both sides would have the same amount
                            of security. He could agree that there was no direct connection between
                            disarmament and the Berlin problem, but that they were related. The
                            settlement of the Berlin question would obviously have an effect on
                            disarmament, since distrust between the two countries was an important
                            element in the situation. If the Secretary wished to discuss any matters
                            arising out of the <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1"
                                >Zorin</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_RD3">
                                <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0193"/>Dean</persName> talks, or
                            if the Secretary had any concrete proposals how these matters could be
                            handled better, he would be prepared to engage in such discussions.</p>
                        <p>Again referring to his notes, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> referred to the Secretary’s remarks on
                            co-existence and said that it was the Soviet Union’s view that the two
                            countries should really co-exist. In the ideological sphere this was
                            more difficult, but in the factual sphere the Soviets felt that peaceful
                            co-existence was both possible and required. There were no insuperable
                            problems between the two.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wanted to comment on a few points made by <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. The latter had referred to
                            our troops in West Berlin as being there to fight the Soviets. They were
                            not there to fight anyone if West Berlin was left alone. They were there
                            to insure the safety of West Berlin. On the question of rights, he
                            continued, neither in terms of international law nor the specific
                            post-war arrangements was there any way by which the Soviet Union could
                            create a situation in East Germany which modified our rights in West
                            Berlin. If we differed on this, we wanted the Soviets to be clear on how
                            we saw the situation. On the other hand, there was no need for practical
                            interference with the authorities in East Germany in the maintenance of
                            free access. This was something that could be resolved, but we did not
                            want to leave the impression that we think East German sovereignty can
                            in any way take over our rights in West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>On the central question, the Secretary continued, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had said the key was in our
                            hands. This was an expression of the lack of reciprocity which is at the
                            heart of the problem. Far-reaching proposals for change have come from
                            the Soviet side. It is not we who have developed the sense of crisis
                            over West Berlin. We cannot accept the proposition that the Soviet Union
                            should make such proposals and then claim that the key is in our hands
                            in the sense that we must accept them. One cannot deal with the United
                            States in that way. The key is in Soviet hands in that it has made the
                            proposals. We are willing to try to find a common key. We require some
                            reciprocal recognition that our vital interests are involved. In that
                            sense the key is in the Soviet hands.</p>
                        <p>As to the technical commission in Berlin, the Secretary added, our
                            thoughts were that anything that reduces tension between Germans in
                            Berlin would be beneficial to us, since such a reduction of tension
                            would be transmitted to us. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said the two sides could not deal with this
                            matter in the fashion suggested in the paper handed him. The Secretary
                            said this was just a suggested formulation. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said it was up to the Germans and not to us.
                            The Secretary asked whether he did not think this was a matter where we
                            could not exercise a certain influence. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> merely repeated that it was the Germans’ job,
                            not ours.<pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0194"/> Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> noted that he had read that the
                            wall had represented a decision of the Warsaw Pact powers.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that, if the
                            Secretary preferred to use the term “common key”, the Soviets were
                            prepared to accept this. He did not understand the Secretary’s remarks,
                            however, about <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty. The
                            Secretary said he had been referring to an article in an East German
                            paper that we had already recognized the sovereignty of East Germany.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> commented that the
                            U.S. may be overly sensitive on this. The Soviets understood this, but
                            what they wanted was that the sovereign right of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in its own territory be recognized. The
                            Secretary noted that he had said the Soviets could not give East Germany
                            something which the Soviets did not have. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> injected that, with the peace treaty, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would enjoy full sovereignty.
                            The Secretary said “Not without our consent.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> responded “This is where we
                            differ.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had noted that
                            the Secretary was planning another trip to Europe. The Secretary said he
                            might make such a trip, but only for a few days. At Athens he had not
                            had time to discuss many problems of interest to the West other than
                            Berlin and Germany, and he wanted to deal with these, such as the common
                            market. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he thought
                            this was mainly Undersecretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName>’s subject.</p>
                        <p>As the conversation terminated, it was agreed that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> would report back to Moscow
                            and when he received new instructions would request a further meeting

                        <p>The President has now approved the development of contingency plans for
                            Berlin on the basis of acceptance of a requirement for passports for
                            West German access to West Berlin, but rejection of any attempt by East
                            German authorities to require visas for such access.</p>
                        <p>In approving such contingency planning, the President explicitly reserves
                            the right of the United States Government to review its position in the
                            light of the actual development of events. In particular, approval of
                            this planning should imply no automatic American undertaking to extend
                            military protection to civilian traffic under any specific set of

                        <p>There are at present no explicitly stated US or tripartite rules to

                            except under the specific conditions envisaged in the Live Oak plans.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName> has believed
                            that he has had sufficient authority in his capacity as commander of US
                            Forces in Europe to order some employment by US convoys of forceful
                            means (short of use of weapons except in self-defense). We considered it
                            desirable, however, to make the rules explicit so that they could be
                            reviewed in Washington and could be adopted by the UK and France. In
                            response to requests for a plan embodying such rules, therefore, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName> prepared a directive
                            which he at first submitted to the US alone. Now, in slightly modified
                            form which takes into account the comments Embassy Bonn and our Mission
                            in Berlin made concerning the first draft, he has submitted it to the
                            US, UK, France and Germany through Live Oak. He has asked for
                            consideration of all four governments on an urgent basis. A copy of this
                            second draft is enclosed (<gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHLO</gloss>

                        <p>In essence the proposed directive would authorize the following actions
                            by an Allied convoy: <list>
                                <label>1)</label>
                                <item>If the convoy is denied passage by administrative resistance
                                    (e.g., refusal to clear it through a Soviet checkpoint), by
                                    undefended or passive obstacles which can be removed by means
                                    integral to the convoy (pioneer tools, unarmed personnel) or by
                                    a small group of troops bodily blocking the way, the convoy
                                    commander after a series of protests and warnings will proceed
                                    forward.</item>
                                <label>2)</label>
                                <item>If initially, or after first proceeding as in paragraph 1
                                    above, the convoy encounters defended obstacles or obstacles
                                    which cannot be removed or crossed with means integral to the
                                    convoy, if the troops blocking the way do not move aside, or if
                                    sizeable troop units are encountered disposed for defense, the
                                    convoy commander after a series of protests and demands for
                                    passage, will withdraw when ordered to do so by the Berlin
                                    Commandant concerned. During this operation the convoy will fire
                                    only in self-defense and only if fired upon. Follow-up action to
                                    withdrawal is provided in some detail.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>A vital aspect of this plan is that it spells out the limitations on the
                            degree of force a convoy will be authorized to use in these
                            circumstances. However, the course of action envisaged should not be
                            considered as leading to use of force in all or most cases. Actually, we
                            are dealing with Soviet efforts to harass, not block, Allied access. Our
                            threat and evident willingness to proceed in the face of this harassment
                            can be expected to demonstrate to the Soviets that harassment will if
                            persisted <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0197"/>in bring upon them
                            the full consequences of blockage, which we do not believe they are at
                            this time willing to incur. A plan for following up our threat is
                            necessary, but only for the unlikely event the Soviets either do not
                            believe it or are willing to go farther than harassment.</p>
                        <p>I consider that, if you approve the proposed course of action, it should
                            be adopted for US use pending tripartite approval. If the British and
                            French will not adopt it, but have no objection to our doing so, we
                            should retain it. We have the greatest number of convoys and hence have
                            greater need for such a plan. However, we should reconsider the plan in
                            the face of British or French objections of such a nature that their
                            cooperation, following US failure to obtain access with the plan, would
                            be doubtful. Lack of Allied support at that stage would leave the US in
                            the difficult position of having failed in a forceful and public test of
                            will, but without suitable measures to press the matter further. We
                            should make very effort to avoid significant weakening of the plan in
                            such reconsideration, however.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted in this regard that there has been scheduled for June
                            9 a US convoy movement which, given its character and the recent pattern
                            of Soviet harassment, may be held up at the checkpoint. Even if US
                            consideration of the plan is completed by that time, tripartite study
                            will likely still be in progress. As pointed out in the first paragraph
                            above, however, <persName corresp="#p_NGLC1">General Norstad</persName>
                            considers he has sufficient authority to order action along the lines of
                            the plan even if formal approval has not been given to it by that time.
                            If prior to June 9 it is evident that the British or French object so
                            strongly to the proposed directive that unilateral use of this course of
                            action by the US would jeopardize their future cooperation, we should
                            consider whether General <persName corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName>
                            should be instructed not to authorize action along those lines while the
                            problem is being reexamined.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you approve the course of action proposed by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName>, together with the
                            above considerations concerning its unilateral adoption by the US. This

                        <p>On June 7 the Soviet Union transmitted to the Embassies of the United
                            States, the United Kingdom, and France in Moscow notes protesting “a
                            series of dangerous provocations” by the West Berlin police and
                            “Fascistic elements” against the German Democratic Republic. In
                            particular the Soviet Union protested the firing by West Berlin police
                            into the Soviet Sector. In their June 25 reply the Western powers stated
                            that the West Berlin police were responding to shots fired by Eastern
                            zone guards attempting to stop refugees from fleeing the Soviet Sector
                            and noted that the difficulties in Berlin were due exclusively to East
                            Berlin authorities acting with the full consent of the Soviet Union. For

                            instructions. He then read from an English text along the following

                            no aide-memoire or other written document was handed over.)</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union has agreed to an exchange of views with the United
                            States Government on a peace settlement with the aim in mind of reaching
                            a wide agreement which would contribute towards mutual understanding
                            consistent with the interests of both sides. The Secretary’s statement
                            had been a repetition of what had already been said many times: That the
                            United States would not participate in a German peace treaty, whether in
                            a single treaty with the two German states or in separate treaties with
                            the two German states. At the same time the United States is evading an
                            agreement which could be concluded on such a basis that thereafter the
                            Soviet Union could complete its peace treaty with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and thus effect a mutually beneficial
                            solution of the West Berlin and other related problems.</p>
                        <p>We now face the task of concluding a peace treaty and eliminating the
                            vestiges of World War II. The most urgent situation requiring
                            normalizing is that of West Berlin. This cannot be on the basis of the
                            preservation of occupation rights, that is on the basis of the
                            continuing presence of the occupation forces of the United States, Great
                            Britain, and France. It is impossible to continue a useful discussion of
                            the German problem by attempting to lay aside the basic question of West
                            Berlin and the liquidation of the occupation regime therein. To do this
                            would be to preserve a dangerous hot-bed which could blow up the entire
                            world.</p>
                        <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0200"/>
                        <p>If nothing was said about ending the occupation regime and withdrawing
                            the occupation forces in the draft principles paper which the Secretary
                            gave Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at
                            Geneva, this was a weakness not a strength of this paper. It seeks to
                            fix the present abnormal situation of West Berlin for an indefinite
                            period and to engage both sides in indefinite talks. It would thus not
                            lead to an arrangement which would draw a line under World War II.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union cannot accept any agreement perpetuating the occupation
                            regime which is now constituted by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            troops. The forces in West Berlin are not the same kind of forces as
                            were there in 1945. Then they were directed at the elimination of German
                            militarism and Nazism and at averting a further threat of World War. The
                            occupation of West Berlin today constitutes a specific kind of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military base in which <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces are stationed.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Government has made a number of concessions in its various
                            proposals to have token forces of the four occupying powers in West
                            Berlin, or to have neutral or <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops
                            in West Berlin. To these has been added the suggestion that symbolic
                            forces of certain smaller <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                            Warsaw Pact countries might be stationed there. In the latter case these
                            forces should naturally operate under the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> flag and not as representatives of the two blocs. They
                            would be in West Berlin on the basis of a new treaty. Thus a clash
                            between the US and the USSR would be avoided and account would be taken
                            of prestige considerations on both sides. These troops would be a kind
                            of symbol of the will of the participants not to allow outside
                            interference in the affairs of West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union had a right to expect that the United States would
                            approach the Soviet proposals objectively, but the US has shown no
                            willingness to compromise or to take account of the interests of both
                            sides. The Secretary of State has said that the United States does not
                            require recognition of the presence of its occupation forces since this
                            is a fact. This presence allegedly gives the United States the right to
                            stay indefinitely in Berlin. The Secretary has indicated that this is
                            not a subject for discussion at all. But if the United States does not
                            want to discuss this subject, then what is there to discuss? The
                            continuing presence of occupation troops contradicts the aim of seeking
                            a mutually acceptable solution and bringing an end to World War II. The
                            US has also referred to its rights under the quadripartite agreements
                            and the unconditional surrender of Germany. But these did not establish
                            a basis for the indefinite occupation of any part of Germany. They
                            envisaged a peace treaty and drawing a line under World War II. The US
                            assumes unilaterally that it has an obligation to defend West Berlin and
                            the rights of its population. This cannot, however, create additional
                            rights with respect to presence or access. As is known, the Soviet Union
                            and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> acknowledge the <pb n="179"
                                xml:id="pg_179" facs="0201"/>right of West Berlin to determine its
                            own life. They are also willing to give international guarantees either
                            by having <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops there or under the
                            most recent formula of troops from the two blocs under the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> flag. Any unbiased person would have to
                            admit that these would be an improvement over occupation troops which
                            are a constant cause of friction.</p>
                        <p>When the United States insists on the maintenance of the occupation, it
                            is difficult not to get the impression that it cares less for the rights
                            of the population of West Berlin than it does for <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military interests. The US has said
                            that it does not recognize any <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> right
                            to control traffic to West Berlin. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> does not need such a right. Even now it controls 95% of
                            all such traffic. When speaking of access therefore, one is talking only
                            of 5% of the total traffic. The only basis for an agreement on such
                            access would be one combining the principles of freedom with respect for
                            the rights of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The Soviet Union
                            is surprised, therefore, that the US has thought of the idea of some
                            sort of international body, with a membership of thirteen states, which
                            would exercise rights in and crossing the territory of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Such a proposal is unacceptable in
                            view of its inconsistency with respect for the rights and sovereignty of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. How could one expect the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to give up what it has to a body
                            devised to deprive the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> of its
                            sovereignty over a part of its territory? This would not better but
                            worsen relations between countries.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union has put forward its proposal for an international organ
                            to act as an arbiter. This was a step towards the US position. It would
                            not control access, however, but be an arbitral body to pronounce
                            judgments. It would not play master over the territory of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> or interfere with its sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>It will be impossible to come to an agreement if the Western Powers try
                            to force through <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>’s claim
                            to Berlin as a Land of the Federal Republic of Germany or his ideas on
                            an access treaty. The Federal Republic of Germany is aggressive and
                            threatening. Every delay in achieving a peace settlement encourages the
                            Federal Republic to new provocations organized in West Berlin, for
                            example, such hostile actions against the Socialist countries as those
                            planned in West Berlin for the middle of July. (When queried by the
                            Secretary as to his reference to the middle of July, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> checked with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName>’s Russian text and corrected
                            his statement to “the middle of June”.)</p>
                        <p>As for the US suggestion regarding an all-Berlin technical commission, it
                            had to be pointed out that, after having taken certain defensive
                            measures, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> made certain proposals
                            to the West Berlin Senat for agreement on measures to facilitate
                            movement between West Berlin and the capital of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. No favorable response was received.
                            This could not be a subject for talks between the US and the USSR since
                            it concerned <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0202"/>a matter within
                            the exclusive competence of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Its
                            solution was an internal matter for the Germans themselves.</p>
                        <p>On a number of items some basis for understanding did seem to be
                            emerging.The Soviet Government did not underestimate these. If the US
                            were reasonable, agreement could be reached on them, but the principal
                            task in connection with drawing a line under World War II is to settle
                            the West Berlin question. As the Warsaw Pact powers had recently stated,
                            they were willing to reach agreement on a mutually acceptable basis. If
                            the Western Powers did not show a similar desire, then the Warsaw Pact
                            countries would conclude a peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> with all the ensuing consequences. This would mean that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would acquire all the rights of
                            a sovereign state and the vestiges of war would be completely
                            liquidated. West Berlin would become a free demilitarized city and the
                            rights of the occupation troops to remain there would not be recognized.
                            All countries wishing to have contact with West Berlin would have normal
                            negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>As Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had said
                            recently to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPEG1">Salinger</persName>, it was
                            unwise for the two sides to try to frighten each other. They both have
                            ample power. To threaten to resort to the argument of force does not
                            help understanding. If anyone tries to threaten, he should realize that
                            he is doomed to failure. It was believed that the US Government was
                            aware of this.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the analogy of the Japanese Peace Treaty, it had to be
                            pointed out that the US and the USSR had fought together against Japan
                            and that the Japanese had also surrendered to the USSR. Nevertheless, a
                            separate peace treaty had been signed with Japan depriving the Soviet
                            Union of its rights as an occupying power. Now the US wants to keep its
                            occupation troops in West Berlin despite such a peace treaty, even
                            though this would merely lead to tensions and prevent the elimination of
                            the vestiges of the war. If it is true that at the time of the San
                            Francisco conference the US had certain ground to believe that it
                            enjoyed a military advantage over other powers; this time has now
                            passed. As the President recently said, there is now an equality of
                            power. Regard must, therefore, be taken for the position of other sides.
                            This must be understood. If in fact the Western Powers force the Soviet
                            Union to conclude a peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>, they will find themselves in the same position as the
                            USSR after the Japanese treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union does not want to see the glimpse of hope and
                            understanding between it and the US fade. It, therefore, hopes that the
                            US Government will not yield to those who are trying to force a
                            collision.</p>
                        <p>(This concluded the formal statement of <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>’s instructions.)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was going to address a rather curious question to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> as Ambassador. He
                            wondered what his answer would <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0203"
                            />be if he were to ask the Ambassador whether he saw anything new in
                            what he had just said. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            responded that his remarks were intended as a summary of the Soviet
                            position. The Soviets had received no reply to the proposal which
                            Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had made as
                            to the possibility of having troops in Berlin from the two pacts. The
                            Secretary stated he believed from what had been said earlier that
                            Dobrynin knew we could not accept this proposal. Dobrynin asked whether
                            our definite reply was that this was not acceptable. The Secretary said
                            “yes”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then gave his first observations on <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>’s statements. He said that he
                            did not think we could accept full responsibility for the phenomenon of
                            repetition. In its essential aspects the Soviet position which had just
                            been outlined had been regularly repeated since 1958. We do not believe
                            that constant repetition will of itself produce a series of proposals
                            from the West which could involve continuous attempts at compromise
                            leading to erosion of the central necessity of our position in West
                            Berlin. It is true that we have repeated this central point over and
                            over, but there has been repetition on both sides. With reference to
                            Dobrynin’s statement about our remarks as to attempting to perpetuate
                            the presence of our troops in West Berlin, we have not used this term.
                            We hope that in time it will be possible to reach a permanent settlement
                            of all outstanding German questions. We do not believe that we can reach
                            such an agreement under present circumstances. We cannot seem to reach
                            agreement either on a permanent settlement or on a definition of the de
                            facto situation. Perpetuity is a very long time and we have not
                            ourselves thought of the question in terms of perpetuity. With respect
                            to a question like that of Berlin which is extremely difficult and
                            central, time can have a useful effect. As the President had indicated
                            to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> in his
                            communication, he was encouraged to think that a way was opening to a
                            settlement of the issues of Southeast Asia with particular reference to
                            Laos. We hoped the Geneva conference would resume and achieve this
                            result. This would be an important step. We also hoped that there were
                            other points, such as outer space and disarmament, where improvements in
                            our relations could occur. The more the general atmosphere improves, the
                            more possible it will be to sort out the relationships between the two
                            countries and the more manageable the central issue of West Berlin might
                            become. An improvement of conditions in East Berlin and East Germany
                            might make this more manageable.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he found it difficult to attach importance to the
                            charge that the occupation troops in West Berlin were <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> troops. Western Europe and the United
                            States united in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> agreement
                            under circumstances with which <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> was familiar. In an analogous sense the Warsaw
                            Pact organization had been formed. The facts that our troops are in West
                            Berlin and that we are members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0204"/>does not change the reality
                            that our troops are there under earlier arrangements and that these
                            arrangements cannot be changed and still have us meet our commitment to
                            West Berlin. When in our modus vivendi paper we said we were not asking
                            the Soviets to recognize the occupation status, we were trying to take
                            the prestige question into account. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> had mentioned it was true that our prestige was
                            heavily involved. If Soviet prestige is involved in the removal of
                            Western forces from West Berlin, this was a problem created by the USSR
                            for itself. Under these circumstances, it was not easy for us to solve
                            the problem of Soviet prestige on the basis which the USSR proposed. Our
                            modus vivendi did try to take account of Soviet prestige.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that he was disappointed not to recognize in
                            what <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had said any
                            element of reciprocity in taking account of the other’s vital interests
                            which, in their last talk, he had requested the Soviets attempt to do.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> kept using the words
                            “concession” and “compromise”. The lack of reciprocity was disturbing in
                            the Soviet reference to certain things which were stated not to be open
                            for discussion. Such subjects as German reunification or solution of the
                            Berlin problem on an all-Berlin basis seemed to be beyond discussion. We
                            cannot accept that only the diminution of our rights and commitments is
                            open to discussion. We do not see that necessary reciprocity here which
                            would open the way to handling this admittedly complicated but at the
                            same time simple and potentially dangerous problem. If Moscow were
                            attempting to consider how things look from our side, its reference to
                            relations between West Berlin and the Federal Republic could not be made
                            as it is made. After all, the Soviets maintain that East Berlin is part
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. In the face of this, it
                            would be perfectly normal for us to say that West Berlin is part of the
                            Federal Republic. Years ago, we entered a reservation which prevented an
                            application of the Federal Republic’s constitution to Berlin in order to
                            be in a position to deal with these matters on a four-power basis. Now
                            the Soviets say that East Berlin is part of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> and that is the end of it.</p>
                        <p>With reference to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>’s
                            mention of the discussion of force, the Secretary continued, he thought
                            it right that neither the US nor the USSR should attempt to settle
                            questions with each other by threats or reference to a war which the few
                            survivors would never be able to understand. But the pressure of force
                            comes from what the Soviets have said and from what <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had repeated today with
                            respect to the consequences of the proposed agreement with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. It was this pressure, intimidation and
                            attempt to frighten which had given an atmosphere of crisis to the
                            Berlin situation. This was dangerous and unnecessary, the Secretary
                            added, but he wanted to identify that this pressure had been exerted by
                            the Soviets on one of the key problems from the very beginning.</p>
                        <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0205"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would not go into any detail on the Soviet attempt
                            to draw an analogy with the Japanese Peace Treaty. We could provide
                            extensive notes as to why we did not consider this really relevant.
                            Soviet forces had not been in occupation in Japan. Soviet cooperation
                            with us in the Japanese war had been of three days’ duration, although
                            we had made strenuous efforts to enlist Soviet cooperation in that war
                            at a time when we were also fighting Nazi Germany. There had been no
                            quadripartite occupation of Japan, no zones of occupation and no Soviet
                            presence. There had been general agreement among the community of states
                            as to the terms of the Japanese treaty, although the Indians thought
                            they were too severe and the Burmese thought them not to be severe
                            enough. The Secretary added that he believed Chairman <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had told the President at
                            Vienna that the Soviets should have signed the Japanese treaty. Thus,
                            there were many differences which do not make the Japanese analogy
                            relevant to the present situation.</p>
                        <p>As to access, the Secretary continued, the Soviets are aware from the
                            newspapers that we have had some thoughts which had been under
                            discussion among us on an International Access Authority. At an earlier
                            point, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> had
                            indicated some general ideas on the subject to Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. We were, of course,
                            familiar with what <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had
                            said at Geneva on a four-power arbitral group. The Secretary said he
                            thought there were matters involving access which could perhaps be
                            worked out, but what makes them secondary is to link the access question
                            with the withdrawal of Western forces from West Berlin. It did not seem
                            profitable to try to find out whether such a four-power body would act
                            unilaterally or what precise authority it would have as long as the link
                            with troop withdrawal were maintained. At Geneva there seemed to be a
                            time when this did not appear to be a fundamental point in Soviet
                            thinking, but this now does seem to have been clarified as a fundamental
                            point. Therefore, there did not seem to be much prospect in going down
                            this trail.</p>
                        <p>These were his first observations, the Secretary concluded. He would
                            report to the President and would be seeing his colleagues among the
                            Western Foreign Ministers on his forthcoming visit to Europe. We would
                            review the whole situation and presumed the Soviet side would do
                            likewise, but he thought the central point continued to be the one which
                            Dobrynin had indicated. It was the key that would unlock these other
                            doors. The Secretary could also repeat arguments one through twenty, but
                            did not feel any need to do so.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he would like to
                            reverse the Secretary’s question and ask what is new in the US position.
                            The Secretary commented that this was an important point. If one looked
                            back on the past year of discussions between the two governments, one
                            noted that we had made a <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0206"
                            />considerable effort to draw attention to certain points we thought of
                            interest and of importance to the Soviets and on which we considered
                            some form of agreement might be possible. We have thus over the past
                            year been injecting new elements. The Soviets, on the other hand, seemed
                            to be putting them in a bag, tying the noose and then asking, “what’s
                            new?” Then when we get to the point of West Berlin, they continue to ask
                            “what’s new?”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> here reviewed what he
                            called the four Soviet variations for replacement of Western occupation
                            troops in West Berlin: symbolic units of the four former occupying
                            powers, of neutral countries, of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            forces and of certain countries of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> and Warsaw Pact groupings.</p>
                        <p>(Subsequently, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName>
                            queried <persName corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienkov</persName> as to whether
                            the second and third above were really variants. It was confirmed that
                            they were, although the neutral units would be there under <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> aegis.) <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that the Soviet Union wanted to lessen
                            tensions in the middle of Europe. Yesterday <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> had been in Berlin. This would probably lead to
                            a further exchange of notes. Did we think that this would help
                            relations? The Soviets were trying to find a way, but the Secretary said
                            only “No, No”. The US had also given an ultimatum in saying it had no
                            answer but to maintain the presence of Western troops. While the
                            situation in Laos contained many elements that were not parallel, one
                            advantage was that the US and the USSR were not confronting each other
                            there. The Secretary commented that he was not sure that this applied in
                            Germany. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> observed that
                            it would be better if troops could be withdrawn to some extent. He did
                            not want to emphasize the point which was linked to the concept of
                            zones, but ending the confrontation would be a good thing in Berlin. The
                            Secretary asked why, if this were so, the Soviets were not prepared to
                            have the four powers accept the responsibility for all of Berlin.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that East
                            Berlin is the capital of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. This
                            was not just an announcement, but there was a completely different
                            social life there. The Secretary commented that there was no reason why
                            East Berlin could not continue to be the locale for the small Soviet
                            contingent just as West Berlin was the locale for the small Western
                            contingents. The fact is, he continued, now that all these other things
                            are in the Soviet basket, they are reaching out to deprive us. Dobrynin
                            asked whether the Secretary believed that a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> presence would put West Berlin in a Soviet bag. The
                            Secretary answered in the affirmative, noting that the reactions of the
                            West Berliners and of our Allies would be just what President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> had explained at Vienna.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the proposal
                            for symbolic troops from the two Blocs was fair. The Secretary asked
                            what the two Blocs had to do with West Berlin. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> responded by saying that it
                            was not the capital of the Federal Republic. The Secretary observed that
                            we were holding it in trust until <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185"
                                facs="0207"/>the day when Berlin became the capital of a reunited
                            Germany. He did not see why the Soviets could not keep their troops in
                            East Berlin simply because of their effort to make East Berlin capital
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. After all there were some
                            twenty odd Soviet divisions in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the Soviet Union had
                            nothing against German reunification, but the situation had changed much
                            since the end of the war. If after World War II the West had wanted
                            unification, it could have had it on one condition—the neutralization of
                            Germany. The US could scarcely expect the Soviets to permit the
                            reunification of Germany under such conditions as would have it end up
                            in the Western camp. At that time the Soviet Union was quite prepared to
                            have a united but neutral Germany. Then came Bizonia and subsequent
                            developments. Now there were two German states. Surely the US did not
                            believe that unification was possible now. It was true that such a
                            powerful people would eventually have to be united. But the Soviet Union
                            could not wait until then. As to the Japanese analogy, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> continued, the question was
                            not one of how long the Soviets had fought in the war against Japan.
                            After all, their contribution in the war against Germany and their
                            losses had been much greater. As a matter of fact, the question was not
                            one of counting the days of fighting but simply that the US did not wish
                            to take consideration of Soviet interests in the Far East. The Secretary
                            observed that a lot of history was involved, but it could not be
                            forgotten that the Japanese treaty came at a time when practically every
                            agreement we had made with the Soviets during and after the war had
                            turned sour, for example that on China. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> commented that there was no China in 1949. The
                            Secretary said that one of the reasons for this was that the Soviets had
                            not kept their agreement on the disposal of Japanese arms. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he could not accept this,
                            but in any event this was not the question.</p>
                        <p>Coming back to West Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> claimed that he could not understand why the US
                            insisted on one-hundred per cent of its position, that is only presence
                            of troops of the three powers. Any of the various Soviet proposals would
                            permit the West Berliners to have their way of life. Why did the
                            Secretary insist on keeping US troops there permanently? The Secretary
                            said he should qualify “permanently”. After all, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> continued, the US is fond of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops elsewhere and the Soviets
                            are not. Therefore, they thought <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            troops in West Berlin should be acceptable. If <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> troops were accepted there, an agreement could be
                            reached on their composition. The main question from the beginning has
                            been that of the Western troops. Other questions were interesting, but
                            were not primary. The Soviets had never tried to give the impression
                            that this was not the principal question in order to get a little more
                            out of the US. Yet the US always said “no” to Soviet attempts to provide
                            a formula. The Secretary observed that we have tried to find some answer
                            to <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0208"/>the question of prestige. It
                            had been unnecessary for the Soviets to make a point which they knew was
                            impossible for us a matter of their prestige. This had been imprudent
                            from a diplomatic point of view. We have tried to suggest how this
                            problem of prestige might be dealt with. The Soviet line in rejecting
                            our suggestion leads to the conclusion that their purpose is to get us
                            out of Berlin and thus bring about a fundamental change in the situation
                            in West Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the
                            Soviets wanted West Berlin to live as it did now. They believed that it
                            was not necessary to have US troops there to guarantee this. But the US
                            insisted there was only one way. This is the agreed way, the Secretary
                            commented. We agreed that the Soviets would be in East Berlin and the
                            Western Powers in West Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that seventeen years after the end of the
                            war had brought a new situation. The Secretary asked what the new
                            elements were. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> responded
                            that there were now two German states which were members respectively of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw Pact. Any
                            collisions between those two states would inevitably reflect on their
                            respective Allies.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that the problem of West Berlin had no bearing on
                            this relationship of the two parties if the Soviets left West Berlin
                            alone. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> observed that
                            West Berlin was a source of danger. Today <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> was there, tomorrow there would be more clashes
                            at the borders. The Secretary said that perhaps if someone other than
                                <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> were there, these
                            frictions would decline. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            said that he would not make the same remark about <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName>. It was not a question of only one man. It would
                            be far better if there were no opportunities for these daily clashes.
                            The Secretary observed that they were not necessary. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that people thought they
                            could do anything they liked in West Berlin because they could hide
                            behind the “big boy”. The US said its prestige was involved. But if the
                            US were not there, then the Germans could not run and hide behind “big
                            boy”. It was hard for the US to say “keep quiet” to the Germans. Neutral
                            representatives or <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representatives
                            would not permit these things. They would say “keep quiet”. Why was the
                            US so stubborn in keeping its troops there? The Secretary observed that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and the Soviets
                            continued to be just as insistent that we abandon our responsibilities
                            in West Berlin. What after all do the Czechs and the Poles know about
                            the so-called way of life in West Berlin? They have had no experience in
                            guaranteeing this way of life to West Berlin. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said they would know what to
                            do and not allow activities in West Berlin which would jeopardize
                            relations between the US and the USSR.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked why there should be a problem from the Soviet view in
                            having an agreement filed with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            with our staying in West Berlin. Why could we not agree that pending
                            final settlement of the German question, the Western Powers would
                            continue to accept responsibility <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187"
                                facs="0209"/>for the security of West Berlin. The access question
                            could be worked out. This agreement could be filed at the <gloss

                            could approve it and establish some sort of presence in West Berlin.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> commented that
                            unless this means <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops, there would
                            be no change from the present situation. The Secretary said that it
                            would give the Soviets a change to refer to something which they could
                            say was better than occupation status. If there were other issues of the
                            sort about which <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had
                            expressed concern, these could be taken up in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stated
                            that with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops in Berlin, the
                            situation would be different. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can
                            follow a line more gracefully than could the US. The Gaza Strip
                            experience had worked out pretty well. The Secretary observed that
                            different parties were involved. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said the Secretary was too suspicious. The
                            Soviets had made a serious offer. It was not just a trick to get
                            something from the US. The Secretary commented that there had been a lot
                            of history since 1949. A lot of experience in mutual confidence was
                            required. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that Laos
                            was a good experience. The Secretary added that we have told Moscow that
                            July 2 is agreeable to us for the opening of the Geneva meeting.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether the
                            Secretary would be going to Geneva. The Secretary observed that what
                            might be done was that Harriman and Pushkin could get the matter
                            settled. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> commented that
                            then the Foreign Ministers could come along and sign.</p>

                                    of May 30, Secretary had urged need for Soviets to bring more

                                    West. In latest conversation <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"

                                    accused of repetition and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                        >Dobrynin</persName> referred to Soviet concessions, i.e.

                                <item>There has then been no advance on substance, but we did not
                                    have impression Soviets are moving toward early military crisis,
                                    although this might change tomorrow.</item>

                                <item>As Secretary has indicated at Athens, Soviets also do not seem

                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>While exchanges with Soviets therefore becoming increasingly
                                    sterile, we believe they have been worthwhile and have served
                                    purpose. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> has
                                    pointed to them as justification for elimination of time table
                                    and of harassments. Should Berlin situation come to crisis no
                                    one could say we had neglected any resources of diplomacy. In
                                    discussion of present Soviet intentions, both Secretary and
                                    Couve agreed that while these highly relevant to Western
                                    position evidence lacking on basis of which any definite
                                    conclusions could be drawn beyond those noted above. There was
                                    also agreement that situation in East Germany was threatening
                                    and might lead Soviets to apply further pressures and threats
                                    similar to those in pre-wall period last summer. Secretary said
                                    that if we were not sure what Soviets up to, we were also not
                                    sure that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> was
                                    certain which course to take. On one hand, he made relatively
                                    subdued statement such as recently in Bucharest.<note n="3"
                                        xml:id="d65fn3">For text of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"

                                    seem to have caught themselves on prestige problem of separate
                                    peace treaty. They also seem to be going ahead with rather
                                    active military buildup in missile and nuclear field, and they
                                    may just be waiting until they attain stronger military
                                    position.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In commenting on French position, Secretary said we seem to be in general
                            agreement on substance and that French views as to whether any headway
                            could be made on substance had so far proved correct. We felt it
                            necessary to go ahead with talks, and would welcome greater French
                            participation.</p>
                        <p>Our differences might well be resolved by events themselves. Couve said
                            he agreed much of drama had disappeared since December <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting, but maintained position
                            that, while French take it as a <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0211"
                            />fact that the US will go ahead in talks with Soviets, they could not
                            approve or participate.</p>
                        <p>In response to <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>’s query as
                            to whether we still had idea of giving new paper to Soviets, Secretary
                            said that we had put in no further paper since Geneva. However, we did
                            not want to exclude possibility of revising paper. At present this did
                            not seem useful, since Soviets have remained adamant on troop presence.
                            We did believe there would be some advantage to putting access question
                            into some sort of framework so that great issues of prestige were not
                            raised on either side.</p>
                        <p>After further discussion of central issue of Western troop presence,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> asked whether
                            Secretary did not think that at some point Soviets would change
                            position. Secretary indicated that there was time at Geneva when this
                            possibility seemed to be opening up, but Soviets had since then shown no
                            further flexibility in discussion of Berlin.</p>
                        <p>After discussion of present Fed Rep attitude on relations with East
                            Germans, Secretary said that, with respect credit request by <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, we were inclined to think positive
                            response might be a good idea. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1"
                                >Couve</persName> said French had no real views on subject, and he
                            did not know whether East Germans would insist further on credits in
                            view of publicity.</p>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Secretary then gave his general impression of discussions which he
                            had been having with the Soviets. He pointed out that our commitment to
                            Berlin was beyond question. Our troops were not in Berlin as tourists;
                            they represented the US presence. We had told the Soviets we are here
                            and will stay here. If they try to drive us out they have been told this
                            would mean war and all the destruction which war would bring. Because of
                            the seriousness with which we view our commitment, we feel we must
                            maintain responsible contact with the other side.</p>
                        <p>Frankly speaking, the Secretary said, he could not report any significant
                            progress in his talks with the Soviets. No agreement was in sight. The
                            simple issue which had emerged was the presence of our forces in Berlin.
                            At the same time we do not believe that the Soviets wish to precipitate
                            a crisis or to create a diplomatic impasse. This may, of course, change
                            at any time. If the Soviets continue to repeat their position we will
                            continue to repeat ours. We had nothing to trade in Berlin with since
                            our vital interests represent fundamental commitments to Berlin.</p>
                        <p>On one aspect of the situation, the Secretary continued, the West
                            Berliners could help. If there were any sign among the population of a
                            lack of confidence, the danger arose that this would give the wrong
                            signals to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, who might
                            think we are weaker than we are and overreach himself. Hence, the
                            confidence of the West Berliners was important.</p>
                        <p>We were concerned about the situation in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>, the Secretary noted. Berlin is involved because a
                            crisis in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> enables the <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> Regime to put pressure on
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, who in turn puts
                            pressure on us. Another point, the Secretary said, which he wanted to
                            make was <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0213"/>there was no disarray
                            on principle among the Allies. He had told <persName corresp="#p_DGC1"
                                >De Gaulle</persName> in Paris<note n="1" xml:id="d66fn1">A record

                            French had been right so far about the difficulty of finding a basis for
                            negotiations with the Soviets. On the other hand, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had confessed that the talks
                            had not produced the kind of disturbances and collapse of morale which
                            he had thought might be possible. Our differences, therefore, are
                            essentially on tactics and procedures, and there is an underlying
                            agreement on policy.</p>
                        <p>As to the press leaks on the makeup of the International Access
                            Authority, the Secretary said, we had not put this proposal to the
                            Soviets but had been discussing it with our Allies. When <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> read about it in the
                            newspapers, he rejected it because of the provision for West German
                            membership. We are not going to argue about a hypothetical question with
                            the West Germans. So far the Soviets have been talking about access to a
                            Berlin from which we are removed.</p>
                        <p>In response to <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>’s question
                            as to whether the Berliners feel that the recent Warsaw Pact
                                Declaration<note n="2" xml:id="d66fn2">For text of the June 7 Warsaw
                                Pact declaration, see Pravda, June 10, 1962.</note> might portend a
                            stronger engagement of the Warsaw Pact Powers and a pushing ahead
                            towards a peace settlement, the Secretary commented that we could not,
                            of course, stop the Soviets from signing a peace treaty. What was
                            important was the alleged consequences for us. The question was whether
                            they would have a sort of <persName>Bolz</persName>-<persName

                                September 15, 1955, see <ref target="#d8fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                    8</ref>.</note> or tell the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            to do nothing, or let the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> attempt to
                            control our access. We were a little inclined, on balance, to think they
                            should not proceed with their peace treaty at the present time. He did
                            not think the other Warsaw Pact members, with the exception of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, played much of a role in this
                            situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> suggested
                            that a more likely interpretation of the Warsaw Pact Declaration was
                            that this obtained the endorsement of the Pact countries for further
                            deferral of the peace treaty deadline.</p>
                        <p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_AF2">Amrehn</persName> stated that the danger
                            of such declarations is that it raises the prestige factor. He wondered
                            whether the question of status had arisen in the Secretary’s talks with
                            the Soviets with particular reference to the ties of the West Berliners
                            with the Federal Republic as they have developed over the past thirteen
                            years. The Secretary said that, on the latter point, the matter of these
                            ties had been referred to briefly some times before. We, of course, had
                            made our legal situation clear long ago in terms of the reservation we
                            had entered on certain articles of the Bonn Constitution. However, we
                            have always insisted that the West Berliners, as far as the other side
                            is concerned, must have freedom to establish <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192"
                                facs="0214"/>whatever relations they wish with the outside world,
                            including the Federal Republic, and that this is intimately linked to
                            the viability question. Because the discussion had centered on other
                            matters, this question has not arisen with the Soviets in any direct
                            way. As to the question of status proper the Soviets are, of course,
                            talking about eliminating the occupation status. Since this is
                            unacceptable, other aspects of status have not arisen.</p>
                        <p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> thanked the
                            Secretary for his presentation and added that he would like to emphasize
                            the necessity to take some action to create holes in the wall by
                            political means. This might be done within the framework of the Federal
                            Republic trade negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss>, through the International Red Cross, through some action
                            by the Western Powers vis-a-vis the Soviets, or finally by some effort
                            to mobilize world opinion, e.g., using the Human Rights Commission of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> (<persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> added that the last point was not the position of
                            the Federal Government in Bonn). The Secretary said we would discuss
                            this matter in Bonn. We have not come forward with any proposals on the
                            wall because we did not want to seem to give the wall status by
                            accepting its presence. When he had raised the question with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, the latter had said this is

                                >GDR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>At this point the discussion terminated and the participants left for the

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>’s memorandum asked
                            for a comparison of the military buildup of Soviet forces with that of
                            United States forces over the past eighteen months and for our views of
                            the probable effect of the current relative strengths on Soviet
                            attitudes toward the Berlin situation in the coming months. I shall
                            treat these as two separate but related subjects in this report which
                            has been prepared with the assistance of the Central Intelligence
                            Agency, the Joint Staff and Defense Intelligence Agency and has the
                            concurrence of the Director of Central Intelligence and the Director,
                            Joint Staff.</p>

                        <p>The size and composition of the USSR’s military forces have been
                            influenced importantly by Soviet policy decisions of the past year and a
                            half, in which the Berlin crisis has been an important factor. A
                            programmed reduction in military manpower and in older air and naval
                            equipment was underway in 1960 and had cut total military strength to
                            3,000,000 men in the first part of 1961. In response to our reaction to
                            the Berlin pressures, the process was reversed in the summer of 1961 by
                            calling some key reserves and delaying the discharge of conscripts in
                            the Fall of 1961. We believe that the force level now stands at about
                            3.25 to 3.5 million men. The increase in personnel strength seems to
                            have been used to bring existing units up to strength and provide needed
                            combat and service support units rather than to raise the number of
                            divisions. We believe Soviet Army strength is now approximately 145
                            divisions, of which 79 are at 70% or higher strength and have an
                            immediate combat capability. The remaining 66 vary in strength and
                            training status but are essentially cadre units of 40% or less
                            strength.</p>
                        <p>During the same period the United States armed forces have been increased
                            by 325,000 to 2,825,000. More significant than the number is the form
                            which our buildup has taken. We have made a major increase in
                            operational missiles, both tactical and strategic. We have filled out
                            skeleton combat units, relieved tactical forces of basic training
                            missions, added needed support units, reequipped with modern weapons,
                            increased mobility, improved the alert status of both strategic and
                            tactical forces, eliminated critical shortages of equipment, and raised
                            forward stockage levels—in sum, we have put our forces on an increased
                            war readiness basis.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to be precise in cataloging specific measures taken by
                            the Soviets and particularly in determining the timing of their moves.
                            However, the Soviets have made important qualitative improvements,
                            notably in mechanizing their ground forces, adding to their formidable
                            submarine fleet, and in expanding their strategic nuclear capabilities.
                            Soviet missile capabilities for nuclear delivery and air defense have
                            continued to increase in the past 18 months, and the tempo of the <gloss

                            <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0216"/>program has quickened. At
                            present, the USSR possesses a ballistic missile force capable of
                            delivering massive nuclear attacks against targets in the European area,
                            and a much more limited force of missiles and bombers suitable for
                            attacking the United States.</p>
                        <p>In sum, we believe that the measures it has adopted since 1 January 1961
                            mean that the USSR is now retaining ground, air, and naval forces at
                            levels higher than originally planned, while at the same time proceeding
                            with an expansion of capabilities with advanced weapon systems. But, on
                            balance, we believe there is no question that the relative improvement
                            has been in our favor and that the Soviet leadership knows it. I have
                            attached to this report two annexes, one showing, for both sides,
                            strengths and changes in personnel and in key organizations and weapons
                            and another describing measures taken to improve combat readiness in
                            critical categories.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Implications for Berlin</hi></p>
                        <p>With reference to Berlin, I feel certain that our improved military
                            position and our firm response to provocation have had a major influence
                            on Soviet attitudes. From the beginning <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> has sought to develop his campaign against
                            Berlin in such a way as to avoid serious risk of general war. At the
                            same time, he evidently believed that Allied concern over a military
                            confrontation would lead the West to compromise its position in
                            Berlin.</p>
                        <p>While the Soviet leadership has received a firmer reaction than expected
                            from the West, it has been beset with mounting internal and intra-Bloc
                            problems. In the wake of the October Party Congress, the Kremlin has had
                            to deal with problems raised by the renewed attack on Stalin and the
                            anti-Party group and with a widening rift in its relations with Peiping
                            and Tirana. Another factor that may be inducing caution is the status of
                            the East German regime which continues to be plagued with economic
                            problems and a resentful, hostile population. It is a singularly
                            unstable Satellite upon which to base a major political issue. The
                            Soviets also apparently intend to continue their efforts to woo West
                            Germany, as a possible alternative to negotiating with the Allied Powers
                            and as a device for driving a wedge between Bonn and its <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners.</p>
                        <p>Another important factor which contributes to the USSR’s hesitancy in
                            pushing its Berlin objectives by precipitate action is that the Soviet
                            leaders appear now to realize that the shift in the political-military
                            relation of forces in the world has been less significant than they
                            anticipated two or three years ago. The United States acceleration of
                            military programs beginning in 1961 has clearly impressed them as a
                            manifestation of United States determination and has also forced them to
                            confront the economic implications of a new round of arms competition.
                            At the <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0217"/>same time, they have had
                            to recognize that the West cannot be persuaded to accept their inflated
                            strategic claims. Perhaps equally important, they have become aware that
                            their real accomplishments in strategic weapons cannot be so readily
                            translated into concessions by the West as they had earlier
                            imagined.</p>
                        <p>We recently estimated (in NIE 11–9–62),<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2"
                                >“Trends in Soviet Foreign Policy,” dated May 2, 1962. (Department
                                of State, <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>-NIE Files)</note> in
                            conjunction with the other <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss>
                            agencies, that it is unlikely that the Soviets are resolved to bring the
                            Berlin issue to a head in some fixed period of time, and that they will
                            probably continue their effort to obtain concessions through
                            negotiations. We believe it likely that the Soviets will not sign a
                            separate peace treaty in the near future, but we do not exclude this
                            possibility. At the same time, we believe it highly unlikely that the
                            Soviets regard Berlin as an issue to be settled by a genuine or lasting
                            compromise; they aim at eventual incorporation of the western sectors of
                            the city into East Germany. We see no evidence that the Soviets feel
                            able either to reduce their basic objectives or to abandon negotiations
                            and seek these objectives by unilateral action.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, in the more recent NIE 11–13–62<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3"
                                >“Soviet Intentions With Respect to Berlin,” dated June 13, 1962.
                                (Ibid.)</note> we concluded that for the near future at least, the
                            Soviets are not likely to moderate their demands in order to take the
                            negotiations off dead center. However, we think they are more likely to
                            do this than to resort to major unilateral action, such as a separate
                            treaty. Most likely of all is a continuation for the present of the same
                            rigidity in negotiations without at the same time any serious move to
                            break them off. While this judgment in the NIE is derived from an
                            interpretation of recent Soviet behavior, rather than from any
                            significant body of intelligence data, we feel that it is the best
                            evaluation which can be made at the present time. The chances are good
                            that there will be a new round of Berlin harassments, intended primarily
                            to keep pressure on West Berlin morale and on Western negotiators.</p>

                        <p>After the private meeting had terminated between the Chancellor and the
                                Secretary,<note n="1" xml:id="d68fn1">For a brief report on the
                                private meeting, see <ref target="#d69">Document 69</ref>.</note>
                            with only an interpreter present, the discussion resumed in a larger
                            group including Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> and other senior officials. The Chancellor
                            announced he had had a good and frank talk with the Secretary. Mutual
                            trust had been increased “if this were possible”. The Chancellor
                            repeated, “if this were possible” (wenn dies moeglich waere). The
                            Secretary expressed his appreciation for the Chancellor’s words and
                            indicated the primary purpose of his visit to Europe was to consult with
                            the Federal Republic and to make sure that no accidental
                            misunderstandings persisted which could be eliminated by discussions. He
                            noted that this was his first visit to Bonn.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said he also wanted to
                            express his gratitude that the promise which the Secretary had made at
                            Athens about the visit had been carried out. While this had started out
                            as “a little promise”, the way the trip had developed it had turned into
                            a considerable commitment of time and energy by the Secretary. He was
                            therefore all the more grateful that the Bonn visit had remained
                            possible.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary then reviewed his recent talks with Soviet Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. He said it was not
                            always pleasant to talk with the Soviets, but this was always easier
                            when the Western Powers are united and going together on the policies
                            involved. He was grateful for the basic unity which existed. He had
                            initiated these additional talks with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> because his Geneva talks with Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had arrived at a
                            point of no agreement on the most elementary Western vital interest: our
                            troop presence in West Berlin. Other subjects had been discussed with
                            the Soviets but there had been no real exploration of these. We kept
                            coming back to the fact that the Soviets were trying to eliminate or
                            cripple the Western forces in Berlin. At one stage in Geneva the Soviets
                            did not seem to be completely adamant on this point. They hinted that
                            they might abandon their position. The Secretary had now seen <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> four times; the talk on June
                            18 had been at the Soviet Ambassador’s initiative. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, in effect, admitted that he
                            had nothing new to say, and the Secretary said he had nothing new to
                            add. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> complained that
                            there were no new ideas from us, but that the Soviets keep coming up
                            with new ideas, for example, the various formulae for replacing the
                            Western troop presence in Berlin. The Secretary noted that he had
                            pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that it
                            was not very helpful to produce a number of variations to accomplish
                            what was not acceptable to us. This did not amount to putting forward
                            new ideas. However, the Secretary added, we did not have the impression
                            that the Soviets now wanted a military crisis or a diplomatic impasse,
                            although we could not be sure of this. We seemed to be getting to the
                            point where there was not much more to say unless we get into details
                            which are attractive to both sides and which might help to ease tensions
                            while the basic disagreements continue, for example, easing of border
                            incidents in Berlin by a meeting of the commandants, procedures so that
                            families and friends could meet with one another, et cetera. There is no
                            reason to think that any agreement on the broad issues of Berlin and
                            Germany is likely in the near future.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that, in his talks in Paris, he had found the French
                            much more relaxed on Berlin than previously. The differences with the
                            French were proving much narrower than had been feared. He indicated
                            that he had to admit to President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> that the French view on the impossibility of
                            finding a satisfactory basis for negotiations had so far proved correct.
                            In return, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> admitted
                            that the Secretary’s talks had not caused the disturbance and crisis
                            within the Alliance which he had feared.</p>
                        <p>There seemed to be general agreement on policy with the French although
                            not on tactics. The French had not said they would join the activities
                            of the Washington Ambassadorial Group for consultation on our <pb
                                n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0220"/>talks with the Soviets, but
                            they are, of course, fully participating in Berlin contingency
                            planning.</p>
                        <p>Reporting on his trip to Berlin, the Secretary said he had been gratified
                            by the good morale and the steadiness of the Berliners. He noted that
                            the German <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> representative,
                                <persName>Von Walther</persName>, during the recent <gloss
                                target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting, and Mayor <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> during their discussions in
                            Berlin, had expressed concern about the possibility of a build-up in
                            pressures in East Germany which might lead to renewed pressures on
                            Berlin itself. If the pressures in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> could be relieved somehow, this might reduce the crisis
                            in the Berlin area.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said that his impression
                            of the <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> talks was that
                            they had gone on in a good atmosphere without bringing any real change.
                            The Soviet concentration in recent talks on the point of the Western
                            troop presence and their general stress on Berlin proper rather than on
                            broader subjects might be a Soviet tactic so they could say this was the
                            really important issue which had to be solved first when the East
                            Germans applied pressure on them to move ahead with signature of the
                            peace treaty. He referred to a recent talk which he had with Ambassador
                            Smirnov in which the latter had placed stress on Berlin, and also to a
                            more recent talk with <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> leader
                                <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> and Smirnov which, if
                            correctly reported, indicated continued Soviet interest in some form of
                            access authority. This to him seemed to confirm the limited nature of
                            the present Soviet interest in concluding a peace treaty. It seemed
                            clear that the Soviets would have little purpose in signing such a
                            treaty without prior agreement on a modus vivendi with the Western
                            Powers. If they did go ahead and sign such a treaty, then they would
                            presumably have to consider inserting some separate Berlin clause in the
                            peace treaty. He thought therefore there was a possibility the Soviets
                            might eventually accept the unavoidability of continued Allied presence
                            in West Berlin; hence their interest in possible access arrangements.
                            This spoke for the probability of drawn-out discussions. As to the
                            situation in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> expressed the view that
                            despite the increasing unrest which reflected stronger refugee pressure,
                            he believed it unlikely that the regime would lose control in view of
                            the overwhelming Soviet military presence in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>. He outlined West German thinking on the East German
                            request for credits. The basic considerations were to do as much as
                            possible to preserve the economic ties of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> with the Federal Republic and favorably to affect
                            Berlin access. The population of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss>, to the extent this could be determined, would argue
                            against extension of credits as further strengthening the regime
                            preferring to suffer rather than to see this happen. However, this would
                            not be an obstacle to a positive decision if other factors were in favor
                            of it. Extension of long-term credits also had the disadvantage of
                            seeming to accept the long-term existence of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> and would also <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0221"
                            />create an incentive, after the period of initial deliveries was over
                            and the period of repayment of credits starting, for the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to upset any arrangements. The Federal
                            Republic had the problem under active consideration. It was clear that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was very greatly interested in
                            these credits. The economic interest of the Federal Republic was
                            minimal, and the political interest was not yet precisely defined.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we appreciated Bonn’s assurance that we would be
                            consulted before a final answer was given to the East Germans. While
                            such credits would be important politically, it was not easy to know in
                            what direction they would go. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had used the existence of talks between
                            Moscow and Washington as a pretext and possible reason for the
                            postponement of the deadline on the peace treaty and the ending of
                            further harassments. Whether an additional trade relationship between
                            the Federal Republic and the East Germans would serve as a further
                            pretext to defer signing of the peace treaty was a relevant question.
                            Moreover, if these credits were as important to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as they seemed to be against the
                            background of economic difficulties in the Bloc, then an extension of
                            credits might create a value which the East Germans would feel it
                            important to protect and thus give them a stake in calm relations. He
                            was inclined to discount somewhat the argument that credits would
                            support a regime from those who prefer hardship to loss of freedom,
                            since no amount of hardship was likely to overthrow the regime unless
                            the West were prepared to fight a war. In summarizing he said we would
                            be generally sympathetic to the idea of credits if the Federal Republic
                            thought they were a good idea, if they did not involve highly
                            disadvantageous trade features, and if they did maintain pressure on the
                            other side to keep the situation peaceful because of its interest in
                            continuing deliveries. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>
                            said the Federal Republic still wanted to consider the various arguments
                            pro and con, and felt no need to begin formal negotiations today or
                            tomorrow. It would discuss the matter with its Allies when the Germans
                            knew their own minds better.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> raised the possibility of
                            dramatizing the incidents at the Berlin wall and demarcation line by
                            bringing the situation before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Human Rights Commission. While the Federal Republic did not
                            categorically reject this up to now it had generally not favored it on
                            the ground that the other side would try to bring the whole Berlin
                            question as well as the question of the peace treaty and the German
                            problem before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, once an opening
                            were provided. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as now constituted
                            could not be relied upon to consider the issue favorably. The Secretary
                            said there were two separate questions involved: What can be done to
                            help the people of East Germany and how can we make the Communists pay
                            for what they are doing? He did not believe that conditions could be
                            improved by a propaganda approach. Hence the question might first be

                            <item><p>I had an hour’s talk with the Chancellor alone. I found him far
                                    more lively and mentally alert than I had expected. Indeed his
                                    mood, including two full evenings of friendly and animated
                                    discussions with him and other German leaders, surprised his own
                                    colleagues. In our private conversation he expressed his concern
                                    about the stubborn strength of Communism in Western Europe
                                    especially in France and Italy; he was obviously distressed that
                                    there are still some thirty thousand Communists in the Federal
                                    Republic. He spent some time on Red China, beginning with the
                                    repetition of his story about <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                        >Khrushchev</persName> having asked him for help against the
                                    Chinese during his Moscow visit in 1956. Yoshida, who recently
                                    visited Bonn, had underlined to him the “national” character of
                                    what was happening in China and had expressed the view that the
                                    path of safety lies in developing somewhat more normal
                                    relations. The Chancellor asked me about reports that a change
                                    in US policy toward China might be in the making. I told him
                                    that we had no completely dogmatic view but that any such
                                    opportunity was severely limited by Peiping’s attitude that the
                                    sine qua non of any improvement must be the turning over of
                                    Formosa and its ten million people. I pointed out that this
                                    presented us with an issue similar to that of West Berlin. The
                                    Chancellor then introduced his relations with <persName
                                        corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> by saying that he was
                                    deeply aware of the fact that the memories of Nazism made it
                                    impossible for Germany to assume a leading role in Europe. He
                                    then recalled <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s
                                    visit to Moscow in 1944 to sign a Franco-Russian agreement
                                    against Germany. Diagramming the geographical relationship
                                    between the USSR, Germany and France he said Germany must do
                                    everything possible to prevent a Franco-Russian arrangement
                                    against Germany. Therefore complete intimacy between Germany and
                                    France was utterly fundamental. This, incidentally, was
                                        <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>’s reflection
                                    of the same underlying longer range Franco-German distrust which
                                    I saw from the other end in Paris.</p>
                                <p>I told the Chancellor that I thought he had greatly overestimated
                                    the obstacles to a leading role on Germany’s part deriving from
                                    the Hitler period. I told him that he personally could now see
                                    his bold and statesmanlike dreams for Europe on the edge of
                                    realization. I emphasized that it was a fundamental interest and
                                    policy of the US that Germany and France be intimately
                                    associated but that we saw this within the framework of joint
                                    leadership and a united Europe and in an Atlantic Community with
                                    ever closer associations with North America. I pointed out that
                                    the Atlantic Community is a nexus of interlocking special
                                    relationships reaching around the globe, including the
                                    inter-American system, the Commonwealth, French associations in
                                    Africa and the welcome development of German interests outside
                                    Europe.</p>
                                <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0224"/>
                                <p>The Chancellor then repeated a view I have heard in Paris that
                                    the entry of Britain, Norway, Denmark and Ireland into the
                                    Common Market would change the entire character of Europe. Again
                                    I told him that I thought this was an exaggerated fear; since
                                    World War Britain has become increasingly European in its
                                    orientation and far less involved, for example, in that vast
                                    area from California to Suez. From across the Atlantic, we found
                                    it at least as natural that Britain could become an integral
                                    part of Europe as that Germany and France could set aside so
                                    much history and become the closest partners. I told him that he
                                    could write his name in the largest letters in history if he
                                    could achieve a situation in which it could finally be said,
                                    after several centuries, that war would not break out over
                                    inter-Western European issues. I emphasized to him that I was
                                    not in Bonn to create any problems between him and <persName
                                        corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> but that I thought
                                    that both of us would have a temporary and minor problem if
                                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>’s
                                    understandable campaign to increase the prestige of France
                                    should be undertaken at the expense of his friends rather than
                                    of the enemies of the free world.</p>
                                <p><persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> made no reference
                                    to the irritations of recent weeks nor to any personality
                                    problems within the present German Govt.</p>
                                <p>He concluded by saying that he had occasionally felt that he
                                    would like to write an informal personal letter about one or
                                    another matter to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                        >Kennedy</persName> but that he had been reluctant to do so
                                    because of the President’s obvious heavy responsibilities. I
                                    told him that I thought informal and very private exchanges of
                                    that sort would be welcome.</p></item>

                            <item>My visit to Bonn removed any doubt I might have had as to the
                                inevitable growth of German pressure for nuclear weapons unless
                                there are multilateral arrangements in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> or Europe or unless there are significant steps
                                toward disarmament in this field. The Chancellor asserted in the
                                most positive terms that his 1954 declaration renouncing the
                                production of nuclear weapons was made under and subject to then
                                prevailing conditions (rebus sic stantibus) and that, indeed, this
                                interpretation was offered by Dulles on the latter’s initiative.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> wrestled very
                                hard to get a flat commitment that we would not refer to the
                                non-diffusion of nuclear weapons in any paper we submitted to the
                                Russians on Berlin. This I refused to do but simply pointed out that
                                the matter might become moot because the US and USSR have agreed to
                                discuss non-diffusion in Geneva immediately upon return in mid-July
                                from the current recess.</item>

                                seen. The German officials and politicians here obviously have great
                                fears that he will be seduced. I cannot help but share the fear that
                                the Chancellor will not stand up well, if the two statesmen do much

                                    xml:id="pg_203" facs="0225"/>by providing conventional forces

                                    >Strauss</persName> showed himself to be in Washington. However
                                when I brought the subject up with the Chancellor he referred to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>’s troubles with
                                his Generals and need to rebuild the morale of the French armed
                                forces. He appeared to accept this as justification from [for] the
                                lack of an effective French conventional contribution to the central
                                front and not to be aware of the diversion of French resources
                                involved in the financing of the force de frappe. He tended to
                                dismiss the subject with the confident assertion that if trouble
                                came <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> could be
                                counted on to put everything France had into the fray.</item>

                        <p>I had lunch with Mike Sagatelyan, the chief <gloss target="#t_TASS1"
                                >TASS</gloss> correspondent here, which had several interesting
                            parts to it.</p>
                        <p>Sagatelyan spent most of the early part of lunch telling me that while I
                            might think his conversations with me reflected the official Soviet line
                            he wanted me to know that he was speaking to me personally and not as a
                            representative of the Soviet Government. He made this <pb n="204"
                                xml:id="pg_204" facs="0226"/>point three or four times and then got
                            on to the subject of Berlin. Sagatelyan said he thought the Berlin
                            problem could be solved on the basis of allowing Western troops to
                            remain there but changing the status of the city into a United Nations
                            mandate or some other form. He said that this was so because the
                            Russians did not consider the Western troops in Berlin to be an
                            aggressive force. Despite Sagatelyan’s protestations, this would seem to
                            be an effort on the part of the Soviets to launch another feeler,
                            particularly in view of my own discussions with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> on Western troops in Berlin.
                            The part about Western troops not being an aggressive force is almost a
                            verbatim quote of what I told <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>. Later in the discussion Sagatelyan told me
                            he had read the latest account of the <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                            talks at the Embassy which again reinforces my opinion that this is a
                            feeler.</p>

                        <p>3591. Please deliver to Chancellor following letter from Secretary as
                            soon as possible and prior to former’s departure for Paris:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Begin Text</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. Chancellor:</p>
                        <p>I would like to take this opportunity, shortly after my return to
                            Washington, to tell you that the friendly reception and valuable talks
                            which we had in Bonn have been a source of great satisfaction to me.
                            They were the highlight of what proved to be a useful, if somewhat
                            exhausting, trip to five countries. The success of our talks has shown
                            once again that there is no real substitute for personal contact in
                            eliminating misunderstandings and differences of emphasis which may
                            arise when communication is limited to the written word and speculative
                            discussion in the press creates false impressions.</p>
                        <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0227"/>
                        <p>I was moved by the warmth of the reception accorded us in Bonn and by the
                            generous hospitality which you and Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> extended. We covered a wide
                            range of subjects of importance to both our countries, and I came away
                            from them ever more convinced that there is a strong and basic mutuality
                            of interest between the United States and the Federal Republic on all
                            the issues that really matter. This is a fact in which we may not only
                            take heart in the present but assurance for the future.</p>
                        <p>I was much encouraged not only in Bonn but in Paris, Rome and London to
                            find an atmosphere favorable for the success of the Common Market.
                            Fortunately, our own legislative action also seems to be going forward
                            in a favorable way, which will enable us to play a full and positive
                            share in the development of an Atlantic partnership.</p>
                        <p>I have the impression that, on the subject of Berlin, we are agreed on
                            the basic principles involved and as to what we should do both to
                            strengthen our position and to continue efforts directed at a possible
                            modus vivendi. We should be able to work out details at the official
                            level as we go along within this framework of general agreement. In a
                            related area, I know how much you have been concerned about the sad lot
                            of the population of East Germany and East Berlin, and how important you
                            consider it that no legitimate possibility be left unexplored which
                            might help to alleviate their situation. As you know, I have already
                            hinted to Dobrynin that we are aware that a major source of the Soviet
                            problem arises out of the nature of the regime in East Germany and the
                            general dissatisfaction which its oppressive practices must inevitably
                            create in the population. We cannot expect that the Soviets will admit
                            the truth of this to us, but I would hope that the point might at least
                            make some sort of impression on their own thinking. I believe with you
                            that we must continue to seek ways and means to help the people of East
                            Germany but in such a manner as not to arouse premature or false hopes.
                            Here again the officials of your Foreign Office and the Department of
                            State concerned with these matters should keep in close touch exchanging
                            both information and ideas. In this connection, we shall be particularly
                            interested in receiving the views of the Federal Government as they
                            develop on the proper attitude to be taken towards the East German
                            request for credits.</p>
                        <p>May I once again thank you for your hospitality and reaffirm my
                            satisfaction that my visit to Bonn proved possible and that its results
                            were so gratifying.</p>
                        <p>With warm personal regards and esteem,</p>

                            of United States troops in Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> must know how important a factor this was in
                            our position and the position of all the Allies. To keep emphasizing
                            this point was endangering a real settlement on Berlin which could be
                            part of a package which might include a number of points of real
                            advantage in the relief of tensions.</p>
                        <p>If Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> wanted to
                            diminish the prestige of the United States by demanding the withdrawal
                            of United States troops and the insertion of other troops in West Berlin
                            with no penetration of East Berlin by any foreign troops we would not be
                            getting anywhere according to my view. This is not the time to
                            crystallize positions on this important issue. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> must remember we did not throw
                            the challenge to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            on Berlin. He did, and he heated it up so much we felt impelled to build
                            up our military position. This annoyed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> very much and he stepped up his armament and
                            all this leads us nowhere. There is a real opportunity to work out a
                            solution on Berlin which may not suit <persName corresp="#p_UW1"
                                >Ulbricht</persName> but which would relieve tensions but they can’t
                            be relieved if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> is
                            really trying to get us to back down in Berlin which we will not do. I
                            said this was a matter on which I certainly felt very deeply and I felt
                            the American people did. There was, in my judgment, real danger of war
                            over Berlin if it were not handled temperately and there should never be
                            an effort to force the issue. It carried a terrible danger everytime it
                            was attempted. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
                            he knew this was a sensitive element in our position over Berlin but he
                            did not see why it was that we objected to neutral occupation of West
                            Berlin. The United Nations could do this as it had in the case of the
                            Suez, for example. The danger in Berlin was the confrontation of our two
                            forces. It was the only place in the world where this was so. The
                            necessity was to remove this danger. The fact that Berlin was surrounded
                            by East Germany did not mean that they would ever be disposed to attempt
                            to overrun the United Nations forces in Berlin. They could never agree
                            to any presence of foreign troops in East Berlin because such a
                            repudiation of the Communist regime by the Soviet Union makes it
                            impracticable.</p>
                        <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0229"/>
                        <p>Then, I said, leave the situation as it is with no further attempts to
                            maneuver us out of position. It was not “intolerable.” It was not
                            challenging; people could very well get on in Berlin if it were not for
                            the new challenge. It was, of course, annoying to <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> but who was <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> to allow him to play with fire.
                            If <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> could be gotten rid
                            of, I had the idea the whole situation would be improved greatly.</p>
                        <p>The West Germans would be much more forthcoming in regard to East
                            Germany, etc. He suggested we get rid of <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName>. I said this might be possible if we had
                            controlled the elections in West Germany as they did in East
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>I referred to the Wall as a terrible acknowledgment of weakness. This
                            symbol of war and concentration camps was sinister, out of place and a
                            dreadful admission of weakness in that people had to be locked in their
                            own home country to keep them there.</p>
                        <p>He said that it was only natural to erect such a Wall—there were barriers
                            at every border crossing. I said I knew of only one such penitentiary
                            wall on any boundary. He said a number of people in the United States
                            Government had indicated to him that the Wall was a welcome stabilizing
                            factor.</p>
                        <p>I said I did not agree. It was just too unnatural and sinister. It
                            induced violence and hatred. It should be disposed of soon.</p>

                        <p>We are following with great attention the development of the
                            Soviet-American exchange of opinions on German peace treaty and
                            normalization on its basis of the situation in West Berlin and we are
                            carefully weighing considerations being expressed by the President, the
                            Secretary of State or on behalf of the President through unofficial
                            channels.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, we, naturally, cannot but take notice of the facts
                            which indicate sharpening of the situation in West Berlin caused by <pb
                                n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0230"/>activities of certain circles
                            not interested in a German peace settlement. Other facts of recent past
                            also support repeatedly voiced apprehensions that the absence of a final
                            peace settlement in Germany not only keeps up the existing tension in
                            Europe but can also cause unforeseen, undesirable consequences for
                            European and world peace.</p>
                        <p>All this prompts the conclusion that further delay in solving the
                            questions connected with a German peace settlement would involve such a
                            threat to peace which must be averted already now when it is not too
                            late.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately in the course of the Soviet-American exchange of opinions
                            there has not been achieved any noticeable progress since the meetings
                            in Geneva. The whole matter has come to a standstill because of the
                            differences in the main outstanding question—that of withdrawal of the
                            occupation troops of the U.S., Great Britain and France from West Berlin
                            and of abolition there of the occupation status. Motives were more than
                            once given in detail on our side why we by no means can accept
                            continuation of the present unsatisfactory and dangerous situation in
                            West Berlin, the reason which lies in the presence there of occupation
                            troops and occupation regime covering in effect the existence of a
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military base in the centre of
                            the G.D.R. territory.</p>
                        <p>We have set forth a number of concrete proposals which took into account
                            the official position and motives of prestige of the U.S. on this main
                            subject of disagreement. The President’s considerations on the necessity
                            to search for drawing nearer our points of view have thus been meeting
                            with a favorable response in Moscow. Unfortunately, however, no proposal
                            has been put forward by the American side which would enhance the
                            possibility for solving the question of drawing a line through World War
                            II by abolishing the occupation regime in West Berlin and by giving it
                            the status of a free city. The expressed considerations about some
                            temporary settlement of the question, so far as they do not provide for
                            abolition of the occupation regime and withdrawal of the occupation
                            troops of the three powers from West Berlin, cannot, naturally, make an
                            agreement easier. Since the whole matter is that of eliminating the
                            vestiges of the war it is absolutely impossible to accept mere formal
                            changes in West Berlin without really changing the existing abnormal
                            situation there which is fraught with possibility of a sudden
                            explosion.</p>
                        <p>Both we and you had enough time for thinking this over. And if both of us
                            are ready to really search for a solution then there are no reasons not
                            to find it in the nearest future, without further procrastination. There
                            is absolutely no sense in postponing until fall, and from fall until
                            spring what should and can be done already now.</p>

                        <p>It can be seen from the last talk of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPEG1"
                                >Salinger</persName> with our Ambassador<note n="1" xml:id="d73fn1"
                                >This conversation has not been further identified.</note> that the
                            President shares the view that it is not expedient to postpone solution
                            of the German problem and that he takes interest in finding a mutually
                            acceptable solution on the main unresolved question—that of the foreign
                            troops in West Berlin. Those proposals which we set forth before in our
                            conviction fully correspond to the interests of both sides. But in order
                            to speed up the solution and make a choice out of the alternatives that
                            we face we are ready to make another effort that in the greatest
                            possible degree takes into account the wishes of the United States on
                            the question of the presence of its troops in West Berlin so far as
                            those wishes are compatible with the task of completing a German peace
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>Our proposal is as follows.</p>
                        <p>The occupation regime in West Berlin will be abolished and during the
                            first years the troops of the United Nations will be stationed there
                            which will act as guarantors of independence and security of West
                            Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Those U.N. troops must not, naturally, either taken as whole or in any of
                            their parts, represent this or that military group opposing each other
                            and their status as guarantors acting in the name of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should be defined on the basis of a
                            special agreement. They would symbolize the determination of the parties
                            to the agreement not to permit outside interference into the affairs and
                            life of the population of West Berlin. Those troops by their nature
                            would be police formations and not combatant troops, what should be
                            agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> police military formations, the
                            initial strength of which should not exceed the combined strength of the
                            troops of the three powers stationed there as of July 1, 1962, would be
                            composed of police military formations of the U.S., Great Britain and
                            France which combined will make one half of such formations in West
                            Berlin; the other half of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> police
                            military formations will consist in an equal proportion of contingents
                            of troops of one or two neutral states, one or two states of the Warsaw
                            treaty (for example, Poland, Czechoslovakia), one or two small <gloss

                        <p>Subsequently the numerical strength of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            police military formations in West Berlin will gradually diminish,
                            namely: during the first year after the abolition of the occupation
                            status those <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> formations will be cut by

                            number. The above mentioned gradual reduction of the numerical strength
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> formations will be carried on
                            in the same proportion <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0232"/>both
                            with regard to the police military formations of the three powers and
                            the formations that will be provided by other states.</p>
                        <p>Since the sides agree that the presence of foreign troops in West Berlin
                            should be of temporary nature they make an arrangement that by the end
                            of the fourth year the remaining 25 per cent of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> police formations will be withdrawn from
                            West Berlin, and West Berlin will be free of the presence of foreign
                            troops. We proceed from an assumption that after the withdrawal of those
                            formations the guarantees by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in
                            respect to independence of West Berlin that would guard that city from
                            outside interference into its domestic affairs, should remain fully in
                            force. With the abolition of occupation status West Berlin will be
                            considered as an independent political entity, that is, as a free city.
                            Subversive activities must not be carried on from West Berlin against
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> or other socialist
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Naturally, any claims by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on West
                            Berlin must be declined for they constitute a manifestation of the
                            policy of aggression and revanche in practice. We are generally
                            satisfied that our positions regarding groundlessness of any claims by
                            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on West Berlin are in effect the
                            same. An appropriate agreement will also be achieved on free access to
                            and from West Berlin with due respect for the sovereignty of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> on the basis of generally established
                            international practice. The German Democratic Republic, as it has
                            already stated, will assume appropriate commitments on this question. We
                            on our part again reaffirm that we have stood and continue to stand for
                            an unimpeded access provided the requirement to respect the lawful
                            sovereign rights of the German Democratic Republic is observed.</p>
                        <p>If differences or frictions arise on practical questions of access they
                            will be considered by a special temporary international body—an
                            arbitrator about which the Soviet side put forward corresponding
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>Simultaneously with the normalization of the situation in West Berlin and
                            abolition there of the occupation regime other questions of a German
                            peace settlement should be finally solved, such as: fixation and
                            juridical formalization of the existing borders of the German states,
                            the border between the G.D.R. and F.R.G. included, nonarming of the
                            G.D.R. and F.R.G. with nuclear weapons (either directly, or through
                            third countries, or through military-political groups in which they are
                            participants), due respect for the sovereignty of the G.D.R., conclusion
                            in one form or another of a nonaggression pact between the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw treaty organization.
                            An understanding on all those questions should, naturally, be formalized
                            in appropriate agreements.</p>
                        <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0233"/>
                        <p>The agreement achieved by the sides on appropriate questions will find
                            its reflection in a peace treaty which the Soviet Union and other
                            interested states will conclude with the German Democratic Republic.</p>
                        <p>Setting forth the new proposal on the question of foreign troops in West
                            Berlin which we believe is paving the way to a mutually acceptable
                            agreement and which we hope the President will duly appreciate, we
                            proceed from an assumption that as the American side has repeatedly
                            emphasized a solution of all other questions of a German peace
                            settlement which were discussed will not run into obstacles.</p>
                        <p>We would like the American side to correctly understand the motives and
                            aims of this new proposal. We deem it necessary before taking steps with
                            regard to conclusion of a peace treaty with the German Democratic
                            Republic with all ensuing consequences which were earlier mentioned more
                            than once to exhaust the possibilities to achieve a mutual agreement. We
                            believe that in a question so important as that of a German peace
                            settlement not a single unused opportunity should be left aside if, of
                            course, all the interested sides are guided by good intentions, if they
                            strive not for an increase of tension in Europe and in the whole world,
                            not for encouragement of forces of revanche and aggression, not for war,
                            but for a relaxation of tension, for peace.</p>
                        <p>The success of peaceful settlement in Laos gives all of us an encouraging
                            example. The President once expressed an idea that if a mutually
                            acceptable solution of the Laotian problem could be reached it would
                            make easier for the United States to find ways to peaceful settlement of
                            the German problem. We also believe that now it is the turn of the
                            German problem.</p>
                        <p>In Laos we moved step by step and now it seems that we are close to a
                            final settlement. Our proposals that were set forth above also provide
                            for settlement of the problem of foreign troops in West Berlin during a
                            certain transitional period, by several stages up to the complete
                            withdrawal of those troops.</p>
                        <p>We want to draw the attention of the President that we are putting
                            forward our proposals on problems of a German peace settlement with due
                            regard for the considerations and position of the American side and we
                            seriously count on the possibility of an agreement. If the President
                            reacts positively to our new proposal, the Foreign Minister of the USSR
                            could at a meeting with the Secretary of State in Geneva come to a final
                            agreement. Thus a meeting between the President of the US and the
                            Chairman of Council of Ministers of the USSR would be prepared, during
                            which it would be possible to fix an achieved understanding and,
                            provided there is an agreement between the parties, to sign appropriate
                            documents.</p>
                        <p>The achievement of an agreement on the problems of a German peace
                            settlement, including the normalization of the situation in West <pb
                                n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0234"/>Berlin, would have a profound
                            impact on all the peoples as an example of effective cooperation between
                            the powers in the field of peace in accordance with the principles of
                            the United Nations. This would be a major victory for the policy both of
                            the Soviet Union and the United States and, we are sure, of all those
                            who stand for peace and condemn war. This would create a basis for a
                            fruitful cooperation of the two powers also in the solution of other
                            more cardinal problems relating to the main international problem of our
                            time—that of general and complete disarmament and developing on its
                            basis peaceful cooperation among all states and peoples.</p>
                        <p>Naturally, this would open a new chapter in the history of
                            Soviet-American relations in which undoubtedly are vitally interested
                            not only the peoples of our countries but also the peoples of the whole
                            world. And the first steps of our countries along a new road could be
                            consolidated by a state visit of the President of the United States to
                            the Soviet Union who would be a welcome guest of the peoples and the
                            government of our country.</p>

                            does not, in the slightest degree, represent any shift in the Soviet
                            basic position. It merely provides a new formula to achieve the same
                            result; namely, the total withdrawal of Western forces from Berlin. It
                            provides that this should be done during a period of four years but in
                            the first year, the Western troops, which will constitute only half of
                            the total contingent, would, in effect, be <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> forces and, specifically stated, would not be under the
                            command of the United States, United Kingdom, or France. The other fifty
                            percent would also be <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces but made
                            up of contingents from the smaller <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            powers and Warsaw Pact powers. These troops would be progressively
                            reduced by twenty-five percent a year, so that at the end of four years,
                            there would be no forces at all in Berlin. The paper makes no advance on
                            the subject of access, and refers, in regard to the all-German
                            questions, to all of the points the Soviet Union would like to see
                            accepted.</p>
                        <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0235"/>
                        <p>Since the Soviet document offers no advance from our point of view and is
                            obviously completely unacceptable to us, and certainly to our Allies,
                            the most important question concerning it is what does it mean from the
                            point of view of future Soviet action? Since, in itself, it does not
                            provide any specific clue on this point, it could quite well be the last
                            Soviet attempt to reach some form of agreement before proceeding with
                            the signature of a separate peace treaty. It could equally well be a
                            means of just heightening the pressure on us in connection with the
                            negotiations. It is fairly certain that the Soviets do not expect any
                            Allied acceptance of this proposal and, therefore, it is either a move
                            for the record to clear the way for a signature of a separate peace
                            treaty—which still leaves very much open the question of the effect of
                            any such treaty on the Western rights and obligations in regard in
                            Berlin—or, as indicated earlier, it is merely a further pressure move on
                            their part.</p>
                        <p>This document is not addressed, officially, to the President, and may,
                            indeed, have been sent to the Attorney General. The question, therefore,
                            arises as to how best to handle its receipt. Since the manner of its
                            delivery is informal, and to some extent unofficial, I would question
                            whether or not we would wish to discuss it with our Allies. To do so
                            would be to depart from the confidential nature of these communications
                            and it would almost certainly leak during the process. The only
                            difficulty with not making our Allies privy to its contents is that it
                            conceivably might be a prelude to moves towards the signature of a peace
                            treaty. I think the manner of a reply, if any, and whether or not to
                            inform our Allies should be given most careful consideration, and I
                            certainly would not feel under any compulsion to get off any quick
                            answer.</p>

                                    Berlin in the near future.” After extended discussion the
                                    Ambassadorial Group concluded that the Soviet Union was probably
                                    not moving toward a crisis over Berlin, but that increased
                                    harassment of access to Berlin could be expected. (Memorandum of

                                    questions relating to the German peace settlement should be
                                    finally solved, as for example (a) fixing and juridically
                                    formalizing the existing borders of the German states, including
                                    the border between the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and

                                    due respect for <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty;

                        <p>The Secretary said that, on his recent visit to Europe, he had talked to
                            the French, British and Germans, as well as the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Council, on the German and Berlin question. In summary
                            he might draw two general conclusions: (1) the United States and its
                            Allies are in complete unity <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0239"
                            />with respect to what we continue to describe as the vital interests of
                            the West in the situation. One sign of this has been the recent
                            identical response of all Governments to the proposal of Chairman
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> for mixed troops
                            in West Berlin of certain countries of the Warsaw and <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> organizations. There had been no
                            consultation on this, but a vital point for the West is involved. (2)
                            There was a real hope that these issues could be resolved by peaceful
                            means and that, over time, the two sides could work into a more normal
                            relationship.</p>
                        <p>One point which, the Secretary said, had not been discussed on his trip
                            and which he would like to stress in view of certain remarks in
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s recent speech,
                            was the fallacy of the idea that the US is in some sense a prisoner of
                            West Germany and is merely parrotting German views on the subject of
                            Berlin. If one goes back to the discussions of last June between
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> and Chairman
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, it is clear that
                            we have been talking consistently about US vital interests, not borrowed
                            interests. These are related to our interests in the security and peace
                            of the West, and the consequences to these if our commitments to Berlin
                            should be shown to be empty and meaningless. We are speaking for
                            ourselves in this matter, and we hope there will be no misunderstanding
                            on this point.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether
                            the Secretary had any comments on the new Soviet proposals. The
                            Secretary said he would not attempt to comment at length but these
                            proposals seemed to be merely a variation on the same point, with the
                            same objective as previous formulae—the elimination of the Western
                            presence in West Berlin. To use the US vernacular, the Soviet proposals
                            were simply “not on”.</p>
                        <p>Looking back to the beginning of the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> administration, the Secretary continued, we seem
                            to be in a dilemma. The President came into office as one of the few
                            young men in high position at the present time among the great powers.
                            He was looking ahead for decades, taking a broad historical view. The
                            Secretary observed parenthetically that, allowing for obviously
                            unacceptable ideological points, he had found the wide historical range
                            of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s last speech in
                            Moscow interesting. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> felt that there were two broad paths which might
                            be followed: That of implacable hostility and inevitable catastrophe,
                            and that of improved understanding leading to a more normal
                            relationship. The latter was the one we should take.</p>
                        <p>As we have discussed Berlin, the Secretary went on, we have mentioned a
                            number of points on which there seemed to be a possibility of agreement
                            and which need not be troublesome. If, however, on the Soviet side these
                            were put into a framework of some sort of stylized diplomatic technique,
                            or regarded as signs of weakness, as compromises or concessions which
                            were obtainable anyway if the Soviets just pressed hard enough, this
                            created a dilemma for us. How can we proceed on the <pb n="218"
                                xml:id="pg_218" facs="0240"/>road to normalization when we are
                            pressed on a point relative to which we cannot make concessions? On the
                            one side we see points which could fall into place; on the other side we
                            see the Soviets becoming more and more insistent on the point of Western
                            troop presence.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> observed that
                            the most recent Soviet proposals should be interesting. The Soviet Union
                            obviously was trying to find a way out. It did not want a military
                            catastrophe. However, it believed that the matter of occupation troops
                            in West Berlin was a source of permanent danger in Europe which must be
                            solved.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the Soviets applied their formulae only to West
                            Berlin. If they were willing to think in terms of Berlin as a whole, so
                            that the confidence in our commitments to West Berlin would not be
                            diminished, this could be talked about. But it put us on a slippery
                            slope to confine the discussion to West Berlin, after saying that East
                            Berlin and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> were not subject to
                            discussion. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> questioned
                            the Secretary’s use of the expression “slippery slope”. The Secretary
                            said that, if the Soviets did not feel that it existed, they would not
                            be pressing. Dobrynin said that this was not really the case.</p>
                        <p>There was a brief discussion as to whether the Soviet expression “drawing
                            a line” should be “under” or “through World War II” which concluded that
                            either expression conveyed the meaning adequately. The Secretary
                            commented that the Soviets have talked about drawing this line and the
                            dangers in the Berlin situation. We simply did not understand what the
                            Soviets had in mind. The danger actually had not appeared until the
                            Soviets started pressing the vital interests of the West in West Berlin.
                            What is the real content of drawing a line under World War II?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that, after a war
                            must come peace, and this meant a peace treaty. If a peace treaty could
                            not be had with both German States, then it should be had with one
                            German State. West Berlin, which was in the middle of an existing German
                            State, was a source of perpetual danger. Every day there were frictions
                            and new incidents. These had to be stopped. Separately, perhaps, each
                            issue was not so important, as for example, the recent humiliating
                            treatment of Soviet citizens connected with the Soviet Tourist Agency,
                            but the cumulative effect was. The presence of Western troops in West
                            Berlin was the presence of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> troops.
                            The Secretary asked if the various troops around West Berlin were not
                            also Warsaw Pact troops. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            said that this was not a real argument, since they were on East German
                            territory. The mere presence of Western troops in West Berlin causes
                            elements in West Germany and Berlin to act provocatively in a way which
                            might lead to conflict. The Secretary asked whether the twenty Soviet
                            divisions in East Germany did not have some influence on <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>’s attitude. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> did not respond directly, but
                            said the Soviets had offered to withdraw their <pb n="219"
                                xml:id="pg_219" facs="0241"/>troops in old proposals. Coming back to
                            those old proposals, this subject could be discussed.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the split of the city, the Secretary said that he could see
                            the desire of the East Berliners to come over to West Berlin might have
                            caused embarrassment, but the situation should be improved locally.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked why the West
                            Berlin Senat had refused to come over and have talks with the East
                            German authorities. The Secretary commented that the West Berlin
                            authorities should talk with the authorities of East Berlin and not of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, as he had proposed in their
                            last conversation. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
                            it was up to the Germans to do this; there had been no answer to the
                            last proposal from the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The
                            Secretary said the contact should be between the city authorities.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stated that East
                            Berlin was the capital of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and
                            anyway this was not the real issue. The Secretary observed that, if
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> were in West Berlin
                            and listened to some of <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>’s
                            speeches, he would not be very comfortable. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that he did not think that <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> would be involved personally in
                            any discussions with any West Berliners.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked when we could expect a response to our note of June
                                25.<note n="1" xml:id="d76fn1">See <ref target="#d62">Document

                            newest Soviet proposal with the Secretary. Did the latter have something
                            particular in mind on this or other questions? The Secretary observed
                            that what we need is evidence of that sense of reciprocity about which
                            he had previously spoken. The one-sided character of the talks on West
                            Berlin on which the Soviets were insisting would not lead anywhere.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked how long the
                            Secretary expected to be in Geneva. The Secretary responded that this
                            was a matter which he was holding a little open. If the Laos meetings
                            began on Saturday, he might expect to <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220"
                                facs="0242"/>arrive on Friday afternoon. If the signing took place
                            on Monday he might stay on into Tuesday, but there was no specific
                            limitation. In the article which he had written, the Secretary
                            continued, he had suggested that he ought to stay at home. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> suggested that he take a copy
                            along on his trip to refresh his memory. In response to the Secretary’s
                            query, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he was not
                            aware when <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was arriving.
                            He did know that the Soviet Foreign Minister was looking forward to
                            seeing the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he did not know whether there was much point in going
                            over with the Ambassador positions which had already been repeated over
                            and over again. What we need is a real indication that our vital
                            interests are recognized, not necessarily in a formal sense, but are
                            understood as they exist in this situation. He did not know that there
                            were any fresh arguments on either side, but he was concerned that,
                            despite the fact we had tried to clarify our attitude and that of the
                            West, the Soviet Government has again put its position on the public
                            record, thus building up the prestige factor. This had been
                            self-manufactured and we did not see much we could do about it. Making a
                            public proposal as in <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                            >Khrushchev</persName>’s recent speech, which the Soviet Government
                            knows does not fit our view of our vital interests, does not help to
                            find an answer to the question.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> commented that, in the
                            last four or five months, the Soviet Union had put forward several
                            proposals. The United States had put forward no proposals on the
                            occupation regime question. The Soviet Union wanted to find a solution.
                            If it did not, it would simply have signed the peace treaty. The
                            Secretary observed that these so called “fresh” proposals are just a
                            series of variations to reduce or eliminate our position in Berlin.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> again asked what the
                            US proposals were. The Secretary responded that the Soviets know that,
                            if they want forces in Berlin, they can have them in East Berlin. They
                            also know that we think the presence of Western forces provided a
                            stabilizing element in the situation. We had suggested a statement of
                            principles to handle the fact of disagreement as well as to provide a
                            forum for continuing discussion.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stated that an
                            interesting stage had now been reached. Both sides knew the arguments of
                            the other side very well. The time had come to find a solution, not
                            merely to repeat well-known arguments. This required proposals in
                            concrete terms. The Secretary commented that the Soviets surely did not
                            expect us to make proposals to get ourselves out of West Berlin.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the US had made
                            no proposals in the last year and a half. The Secretary observed that he
                            thought the Soviet Ambassador underestimated the exchanges between the
                            two Governments. We had made so many proposals that even <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> had recently listed four or
                            five points on which agreement had been <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221"
                                facs="0243"/>reached.<note n="4" xml:id="d76fn4">For text of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>’s July 7 speech
                                at Rostock, see <hi rend="italic">Dokumente zur Deutschlandpolitik,
                                    1962</hi>, pp. 809–816.</note><persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said he was thinking of the central issue. The
                            Secretary went on to say that the only proposals the Soviets had made
                            would reduce our position and enlarge the Soviet position. When the US
                            tried to find a fair solution, or to improve its position, the Soviets
                            said these matters were not to be discussed. In effect, they were in the
                            bag.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said his Government still
                            hoped that a way out could be found on the main and central issue, and
                            that thereafter a solution of the German question as a whole could be
                            found. The main issue is the abolition of occupation troops.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would like to ask on what basis the Soviets
                            considered that they had an interest in West Berlin except in terms of
                            the occupation rights derived from the defeat of Nazi Germany. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> responded that his Government
                            held that, 17 years after the war, troops must cease to have the status
                            of occupation forces. The Secretary noted the Soviets were saying a
                            great deal more than that the Western troops should be there on another
                            basis than occupation. They are saying that the troops should not be
                            there at all, or should share their position with Soviet troops or
                            Warsaw Pact troops. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
                            it was not a question of sharing possession but just of guaranteeing the
                            status of West Berlin. West Berlin must be an independent entity. The
                            question is how to guarantee this. The Western troops would not provide
                            a good guarantee; they are already a source of friction. The guarantee
                            provided by a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troop presence would be
                            better. Why could it not be accepted? The Secretary said there was no
                            objection to a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence of some sort
                            in Berlin, not just West Berlin. The Western forces are in fact
                            surrounded by <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> and his men
                                (<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> protested at this).
                            We cannot ourselves see how the freedom and security of the people of
                            West Berlin can be maintained without the three Western Powers. If
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> were a West
                            Berliner, he would feel the same way. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> commented that, if he were a responsible
                            citizen of West Berlin, he would not want these troops which were a
                            source of so much friction. The Secretary commented that the only case
                            in the free world where we would find such unanimity as is found in
                            elections in the Soviet Union would be a West Berlin vote on the
                            continued presence of the Western powers. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that, if the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> troop question were put up to the population, he was not
                            sure that it would not be supported. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                >Kohler</persName> asked whether if the question were put to the
                            vote the Soviets would accept the verdict of the West Berliners.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he was not a
                            Berliner. This was a matter in which the national interests of the
                            Soviet Union were involved. The Soviets had <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222"
                                facs="0244"/>not asked German permission when they came to Berlin,
                            and they did not want the Germans to decide on a matter where their
                            national interests were involved.</p>
                        <p>During a discussion which then ensued of the Common Market (reported in
                            separate memorandum of conversation), <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> asked about the future of US trade with the
                            Soviet Union in view of Congressional attitudes. The Secretary observed
                            that the prejudice of our policy favors trade. We are a trading nation,
                            and we trade unless there is a reason not to. In his recent speech
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had referred to
                            post-1946 military expenditures. He wished that there were some people
                            in the Soviet Union assigned, perhaps as war-gamers, to the task of
                            telling the Soviet leaders how Americans thought about things. In 1946
                            we had greatly reduced the US armed forces. Not a division or air unit
                            was ready for combat. Our Defense budget was about 10 billion dollars.
                            Now it is over four times that much. Why did this come about? It started
                            with Soviet policies during the Stalinist period, the Greek experience,
                            etc. The major jump had come at the time of the Korean war. If <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had not insisted on greatly
                            reducing or eliminating our position in Berlin last summer, the
                            subsequent increase in our forces would not have occurred. If Stalin had
                            not pushed in his time, the US would be disarmed today for all practical
                            purposes. Because of pressures on Berlin, we have strengthened our
                            forces. The Soviets became alarmed and strengthened their forces, and
                            all this in relation to Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The President would like to move on trade but people who are opposed to
                            trade with the Soviets are nourished by pressures on Berlin. The
                            Secretary repeated that he hoped that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> would come to Geneva with a basis on which a
                            solution on some of these problems could be found. He noted that he had
                            referred to the two different roads that the US and the Soviet Union
                            could take. The choice of alternatives was extremely important. We
                            wanted to improve our relations if possible. This was the President’s
                            view. If you removed from <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s recent speech the ideological elements,
                            which we could not, of course, accept, there was an undertone of
                            seriousness in what he said. His remarks about the diversion of
                            resources to the arms race provided a basis on which we could agree.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he supposed <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> had been a little surprised that he had been so
                            moderate during his visit to Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that he had noticed this, and that the
                            Secretary observed that one thing that had surprised him, in returning
                            by helicopter from the City Hall to the Airport, was the emptiness of
                            East Berlin, not merely at the Wall but for a considerable distance
                            behind it.</p>

                        <p>Memorandum of Conversation between the President and Ambassador <persName

                            p.m. (prepared from the President’s account and approved by the
                            President July 18)</p>
                        <p>The President met alone with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> and talked with him for just under an hour. The
                            atmosphere of the conversation was agreeable. After some pleasantries
                            the conversation turned on three subjects: Berlin, nuclear testing, and
                            developments in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>On Berlin, the President told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> that he had prepared and would soon have
                            delivered a reply<note n="1" xml:id="d77fn1"><ref target="#d78">Document

                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s recent communication.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d77fn2"><ref target="#d73">Document 73</ref>.</note> The
                            President emphasized that the presence of Allied troops in West Berlin
                            is a vital interest of the United States. For this reason none of the
                            Soviet proposals for alternative arrangements could be accepted; all of
                            them, in one way or another, implied the departure of Western
                            troops—they would get us out, and without so much as a fig leaf of
                            concealment. This would mean a major retreat. Europe would lose
                            confidence in U.S. leadership. It would be a major victory for the
                            Soviet Union and a major defeat for the West.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that
                            Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would be
                            greatly disappointed in this response to his most recent proposal. He
                            asked whether the American position was related to German interests or
                            American interests. The President said again that he was speaking of a
                            vital U.S. interest. There might well be other issues on which we would
                            be willing to press the Germans quite hard—as, for example, on the
                            structure of an access authority. But on the question of our presence in
                            Berlin, there was no argument among the Western Allies; it was of vital
                            interest to all. The President remarked that he had made this point
                            clear to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            in the fall of 1961.<note n="3" xml:id="d77fn3">For a memorandum of the
                                President’s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> argued that in
                            its present condition Berlin is a potential source of dangerous friction
                            and conflict and that a removal <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0246"
                            />of Western troops would lessen the dangers. The President stated that
                            while he could understand Soviet objections to the presence of Western
                            troops, he must emphasize again that the removal of Western troops would
                            be a disaster for us, while their presence was not a disaster for the
                            Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The President also emphasized that Soviet-created tensions in Berlin had
                            caused increases in Western rearmament and that any new crisis would
                            have a similar effect. The President noted the disagreement which the
                            United States has with its Allies on the diffusion of nuclear weapons,
                            and said that Soviet-created tensions could only increase the danger of
                            results which the Soviet Government would not like. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> argued in reply that it was
                            the fact of Western troops in West Berlin which created these dangers.
                            This was the one point of direct confrontation between opposing great
                            powers, and it was naturally a source of danger. If the confrontation
                            could be ended, the dangers would be reduced. The President repeated
                            that the real cause of danger was the Soviet effort to change the
                            existing situation, that the way to reduce tension was to reach an
                            understanding, and that the presence of Allied troops was a vital
                            interest. The Ambassador repeated that the Chairman would be
                            disappointed.</p>

                            />its contents related directly to the subject of their discussion, but
                            I should also like to take this opportunity to add my personal views. I
                            believe that in a matter of such seriousness and potential danger to
                            peace, we must take advantage of any legitimate channel in an effort to
                            clarify our respective positions.</p>
                        <p>As heads of government we are naturally interested in the welfare of our
                            peoples, but we also have a certain obligation to history and to
                            humanity as a whole. This dual responsibility demands that each of us
                            make an effort to understand the position of the other and to see
                            whether accommodations cannot be made, consistent with the basic
                            interests of both parties, directed toward finding peaceful solutions to
                            outstanding differences. This seems particularly important in the case
                            of Germany and Berlin where the vital interests of great nations are
                            involved at a major point of friction.</p>
                        <p>What we, therefore, find especially troubling in the present Soviet
                            position is the consistent failure, even in the very formulation of the
                            problem, to take any real account of what we have made clear are the
                            vital interests of the United States and its Allies. For example, the
                            Soviet Government has on a number of occasions, as in your most recent
                            communication, complained that it has put forward a number of concrete
                            proposals which take into account “the official position and motives of
                            prestige of the United States,” but that “unfortunately, no proposal has
                            been put forward by the American side which would enhance the
                            possibility of solving the question of drawing a line through World War
                            II by abolishing the occupation regime in West Berlin and giving it the
                            status of a free city.” Such a formulation is, in effect, the very crux
                            of the problem, because it states the issue in a way which embodies all
                            of the Soviet premises and none of the Western premises in this
                            evaluation of the current situation.</p>
                        <p>We have gone to some pains over the past year to define to you what we
                            consider to be our vital interests in the Berlin situation. These do not
                            take away anything from the Soviet Union which it now enjoys. On the
                            contrary, we have attempted to show that an arrangement mindful of these
                            interests could lead to a chain of developments of mutual benefit to
                            both sides. The Soviet Government, on the other hand, consistently
                            states the problem in terms which completely ignore our vital interests
                            and proposes an outcome under the shadow of a threatened fait accompli
                            which the Western Powers can either accept in advance or in the actual
                            fact.</p>
                        <p>In your recent communication, you note that the “main outstanding
                            question is that of the withdrawal of the occupation troops of the
                            United States, Great Britain and France from West Berlin and of the
                            abolition there of the occupation status.” To accept this formulation
                            would be to accept the Soviet position one hundred per cent. We find it
                            difficult to <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0248"/>see even the
                            slightest element of compromise here on the part of the Soviet
                            Government. The various formulae which the Soviet Government has put
                            forward all have the same objective—the total withdrawal or a severe
                            reduction in the position of Western forces in Berlin. Merely mixing the
                            same ingredients together in different proportions does not change the
                            basic fact that the result is impossible from our point of view. We
                            cannot, therefore, accept as accurate the statement that these formulae
                            attempt to take into account the “official position and motives of
                            prestige of the United States.” They run directly counter to them. Does
                            the Soviet Government really believe that our acceptance of any of them,
                            including the most recent, would not be interpreted throughout the world
                            as a complete capitulation? We know that it would be, not only by the
                            West Berliners who would immediately begin to abandon the city and leave
                            it a hollow shell, but by all governments and informed peoples. It was
                            for this reason that, at our meeting in Vienna now more than a year ago,
                            we placed such stress on the commitment of the United States to Berlin
                            in terms of our national prestige and vital interests. Nothing that has
                            happened since then has affected the meaning of our remarks.</p>
                        <p>The question of Western troop presence is central. Surface changes in the
                            Soviet position which do not really take account of this fact do not
                            provide a real basis for serious negotiations. Without this recognition
                            of our vital interests it is difficult to see how other aspects of the
                            situation can usefully be considered.</p>
                        <p>Having said this much about the Soviet position, I feel that I must also
                            comment on your description of our position. To say that the American
                            side has not put forward a proposal “which would enhance the possibility
                            of solving the question of drawing a line through World War II by
                            abolishing the occupation regime in West Berlin and by giving it the
                            status of a free city” is, as I have indicated, to state the problem
                            without the most minimum elements of reciprocity. We are not opposed to
                            drawing a line through World War II (though we believe it more important
                            to avoid World War III), but drawing such a line to us cannot mean
                            accepting the position of one of the victors of World War II at the
                            complete expense of three of the other victors. Our views as to how
                            appropriately to draw a line through World War II are well known. We
                            understand that these views are unacceptable to the Soviet Government.
                            Because we know this we have not insisted on pressing our views to the
                            point of conflict and crisis, although we believe them to be correct. We
                            could not, of course, be expected to put forward proposals eliminating
                            ourselves from West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>We have instead tried to be practical in our approach and in the specific
                            proposals we have put forward. These have not proceeded from the
                            assumption that one side must be prepared to abandon its position
                            entirely. <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0249"/>We have instead been
                            motivated by the desire to eliminate the Berlin issue as a source of
                            major conflict, which it is in the interest of both sides to avoid. We
                            have attempted, therefore, to provide a means of dealing with the fact
                            of disagreement in such a way as to serve the broader common interest of
                            both sides in the avoidance of head-on collision and in the preservation
                            of peace. We have also made a number of suggestions for relaxing the
                            sense of crisis in the Berlin area.</p>
                        <p>You are, of course, familiar with the informal working paper which
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> gave Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at Geneva on
                            March 22, 1962.<note n="3" xml:id="d78fn3">See <ref target="#d19"
                                    >Documents 19</ref> and <ref target="#d20">20</ref>.</note> We
                            have never felt that the merits of our suggested approach have really
                            adequately been considered by the Soviet Government or dealt with in
                            subsequent discussions. The language of this paper was not meant to be
                            sacrosanct, but it reflected a sincere effort to find points on which
                            there seemed to be at least some agreement in terms of previous
                            statements made by both sides. We would, therefore, hope that you would
                            review the explanations which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName> has given to see whether our approach does not
                            suggest an acceptable way out of the present impasse.</p>
                        <p>In a recent speech,<note n="4" xml:id="d78fn4">See <ref target="#d75fn2"
                                    >footnote 2, Document 75</ref>.</note> you pointed to the
                            example of Laos as showing that, given a desire for agreement, ways can
                            be found to settle the most challenging and complicated international
                            problems. We can agree entirely with this. In the case of Berlin, there
                            is also undoubtedly a desire for agreement. What seems to be lacking so
                            far, however, is any common ground as to what might be required in order
                            to achieve agreement. Desire for agreement is important as a necessary
                            beginning, but it cannot suffice in itself unless a spirit of patience
                            and of respect for the vital interests of the other party is also
                            present. We feel confident that, if these factors are present, we will
                            also be able to work out something on Berlin which will contribute a
                            resolution satisfactory to both sides.</p>
                        <p>In your same speech you pointed out that the German question did not have
                            a direct bearing on disarmament but was closely related to it. Here
                            again we can agree. Even a quieting of the Berlin question on the basis
                            of respect for the mutual interests of both sides could not help but
                            markedly improve the entire atmosphere of relations between the Soviet
                            Union and the United States. As the two major nuclear powers, we have an
                            overriding common interest, deriving from our troubling knowledge of the
                            destructive potentialities of the new weapons, in preventing their
                            spread into the control of other countries. We are certain that one of
                            the major factors in recent years, not only in the general acceleration
                            of arms preparations but also in focusing attention on nuclear <pb
                                n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0250"/>weapons, has been the almost
                            continuous crisis over Berlin since November, 1958. Further threats to
                            Berlin and continued heightening of the crisis can only lead to
                            additional measures in this direction.</p>
                        <p>We feel, therefore, that we have an additional strong and common interest
                            in arriving at a solution of the Berlin problem, consistent with our
                            mutual interests and prestige, in order to relieve the continuing
                            pressures for an arms race including the piling up and diffusion of
                            nuclear weapons. We might add that the enlarged U.S. military
                            preparations which began last summer took place only after the renewal
                            of Soviet threats against our position in Berlin. Our efforts in the
                            military field, and those of our Allies, were a sign of the seriousness
                            which which we all regard the defense of our vital interests in Berlin.
                            This military build-up, however, was not something we wanted, or
                            something which would have happened in the absence of the developments
                            of last summer. If it is true that the threats to our position in Berlin
                            remain a serious source of difference between our two countries, it is
                            just as obvious that some satisfactory arrangement on Berlin would
                            greatly improve the atmosphere and remove an important motive for
                            increased Western effort in the armaments field. This is a consideration
                            to which we hope you will give deep personal thought. Further pressures
                            on Berlin can only exacerbate the situation and enhance the danger of an
                            arms race which we assume neither of us basically desires.</p>
                        <p>We undoubtedly live in a climactic age. Science has now given man a
                            capacity for destruction which, for the first time, could threaten the
                            very existence of the race itself. This fact makes it imperative that,
                            as rational men, we attempt to resolve our differences rather than move
                            step-by-step towards a major confrontation. In reading the history of
                            past wars and how they began, we cannot help but be impressed how
                            frequently the failure of communication, misunderstanding and mutual
                            irritation have played an important role in the events leading up to
                            fateful decisions for war. In the nuclear age, we cannot be resigned to
                            passive acceptance of a chain of causation which seems to determine the
                            course of history from the outset. We know from your own willingness to
                            discuss these matters that you do not hold to the view that what is
                            happening now is predetermined, and cannot be affected by the decisions
                            which our governments take. I write with this in mind, and urge that you
                            give serious thought to the reflections and suggestions which this
                            communication contains. I have not tried here to deal with every aspect
                            of your communication, but have limited our comment to what seems to be
                            the heart of the issue between us. We would not, however, want silence
                            on these other points to be interpreted as complete agreement on our
                            part with your formulation of the problems and suggested solutions.</p>

                        <p>If I may summarize, the following lines of approach have seemed to us to
                            be open in seeking a satisfactory resolution of the German and Berlin
                            question: <list>

                                <item>We might join in a real attempt to draw a line through World
                                    War II by agreeing on a German settlement based on the freely
                                    expressed wish of the German people. As you know, this is in our
                                    view the best solution to the problems of Germany and Berlin. We
                                    have not pressed in these private exchanges for your agreement
                                    to this solution because you have emphasized that it is
                                    unacceptable to you—as unacceptable as your proposals for the
                                    removal of our troops from Berlin are to us.</item>

                                <item>Short of an all-German settlement, we might agree on new and

                                <item>We might deal with the present situation as a factual matter,
                                    including the fact of the Western presence in West Berlin. This
                                    could mean proceeding on the basis of our informal working paper
                                    of March 22, 1962. It would essentially reflect a recognition
                                    that there are basic elements in the Berlin situation on which
                                    there cannot now be agreement. With such recognition, steps
                                    might be taken to ease tensions in the immediate area of Berlin,
                                    and it might perhaps be less difficult thereafter to deal with
                                    other aspects of the Berlin question while moving ahead with the
                                    reduction of tensions in other fields. We have in mind here
                                    particularly steps toward disarmament.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>It is now expected that our Foreign Ministers will be meeting shortly in
                            Geneva to sign an agreement on Laos. They will undoubtedly find the
                            occasion to discuss further the question of Berlin. We hope that Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will come to
                            Geneva with a position embodying genuine elements of reciprocity and
                            taking account of our vital interests in the Berlin situation. If this
                            should prove to be the case, we feel certain that much progress can be
                            made in removing a major source of contention—an accomplishment which
                            would surely have a remarkable and heartening effect in improving the
                            atmosphere and making possible progress in other related areas.</p>

                                        their policy on Berlin. Therefore, the Allies should give
                                        the Soviet Union opportunity to draw back and even (without

                            <item>In general, the apparent impression conveyed to the President by
                                the extensive discussion was that months would be required before
                                any substantial operative plans came into existence, that not very
                                much had been accomplished with our Allies—especially at <gloss

                                contingencies. Although the meeting was not supposed to address the
                                subject of a separate peace treaty until after the consideration of
                                    <gloss target="#t_BERCONMARCON1">BERCONs/MARCON</gloss>s, the
                                President’s early questions apparently brought this subject into the
                                arena right away. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                    >Rusk</persName> reported the fact of many agreed papers, draft
                                notes and announcements, etc. He also said that when in Europe later
                                this week he would propose to the other Quadripartite Foreign
                                Ministers the advisability of reviewing their contingency plans for
                                a separate peace treaty in the light of developments during the past
                                several months; he also thought that it might now be appropriate to
                                encourage the French to return actively into the Berlin planning
                                forum. The President’s questions brought out the fact that there did
                                not exist any genuine counterproposal for action in the event of a
                                separate peace treaty, but rather only plans for using selected
                                mechanics designed to accommodate to the separate treaty. The
                                President strongly felt that the Western reaction to a separate
                                peace treaty should not be such as to imply great concern over the
                                treaty (this, of course, is in fact the sense of the agreed Allied
                                position).</item>

                            <item>After the above early discussion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1"
                                    >Nitze</persName> proceeded to outline briefly and generally the

                                but the President kept intervening with questions. In answer to one
                                of them, General <persName corresp="#p_GMGDW1">Gray</persName> said
                                that on his recent trip to Europe he had discovered the <gloss

                                not yet even descended to the level of Armies, and that therefore
                                some months would undoubtedly be required before fully prepared
                                operational plans would be available up and down the entire

                            <item>At one point in the discussion the briefers mentioned that the

                                mobilization activity. The President thereupon asked what the US
                                plan was for mobilizing whom on what time schedule, but no ready
                                answer was forthcoming from the group.</item>

                        <p>During yesterday’s discussions of Berlin contingency planning (<gloss
                                target="#t_BERCONMARCON1">BERCON/MARCON</gloss> Plans), <persName

                                >JCS</gloss>) made a statement to the effect that the State
                            Department considered it necessary to have a pause—about 60 days—before
                            the West would respond militarily to Soviet interference with Western
                            access to Berlin. Unfortunately, General <persName corresp="#p_GMGDW1"
                                >Gray</persName> did not make clear the context in which he was
                            speaking, nor did he define precisely what he meant by the pause or the
                            reasons for it.</p>
                        <p>The fact is that the period between Soviet/<gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> blockage of access to Berlin and the outbreak of
                            hostilities—Phase II in the conceptual framework spelled out in <gloss

                            which most intensive diplomatic efforts—backstopped by appropriate
                            military and economic measures—will be made to avoid the outbreak of
                            hostilities and reach a political rather than a military solution to the
                            Berlin problem. It is the period during which the West will bring into
                            play a progressive series of moves, designed to impress the Kremlin with
                            its determination to protect its position, but <pb n="233"
                                xml:id="pg_233" facs="0255"/>yet providing the Soviet leadership
                            with the opportunity to modify its behavior in time to avert a clash
                            beyond the level of no return. This may take 60 days; it may take
                            several months. At this juncture it is clearly impossible to estimate
                            the period with any kind of precision. However, the consensus is that
                            unless the Soviets either by miscalculation or deliberate decision
                            resort to force to impose their solution on Berlin, the odds are in
                            favor of a longer rather than a shorter Phase II. And as Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> indicated, there is
                            no difference of view on this score between the Departments of State and

                        <p>In essence, then, Phases I and II are noncombatant, while Phases III and
                            IV are combatant periods, so that the critical point in the Allied
                            effort to end Soviet/<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> interference
                            with the exercise of basic Allied rights in Berlin is just prior to
                            Phase III.</p>
                        <p>The underlying assumption in all this is that the Soviets, as we, wish to
                            avoid general war. This of course will not stop the Soviets from
                            pressing on for their objectives in Berlin. Nor does it mean that we
                            will not have to face up to periodic increase in tensions, with varying
                            degrees of heat. But unless there is a radical shift in Soviet policy,
                            or miscalculation by the Soviet leadership, the critical point in the
                            Berlin exercise will be reached just short of Phase III.</p>
                        <p>For all practical purposes, we are now in Phase I. Intermittently, since
                            the end of the 1948–1949 blockade, both German and Allied access, in the
                            air and on the ground, have been subjected to Communist harassment of
                            one sort or other. Over the years, however, we and the Soviets have
                            found methods for dealing with these harassments sometimes by facing
                            each other down as during the air corridor harassments of last spring;
                            more often by patient and protracted negotiations, such as the efforts
                            which finally produced the existing Autobahn identification
                            procedures.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet tacticians at some time may consider it necessary for the
                            Kremlin to strike a more threatening and aggressive pose in Berlin and
                            interrupt Allied and/or German traffic to Berlin, all or in part. This
                            in effect is Phase II. And present planning for this Phase envisages
                            intensified <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0256"/>diplomatic efforts
                            and maneuvers, backstopped by a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            military build-up and the imposition of economic countermeasures ranging
                            from limited restrictions up to and including a total embargo on trade
                            with the Soviet Union and its Satellites.</p>
                        <p>The most difficult and critical problem in the exercise is communicating
                            our position and intentions to the Soviet leadership to induce,
                            persuade, or compel it to agree or acquiesce, and to provide it with the
                            means to do either gracefully.</p>
                        <p>By the same token, the Soviet response to our move will be determined
                            largely by what they believe our purposes to be, our ability to achieve
                            these purposes, and our resolve and capability to assume the risks in
                            raising the threshhold. This in fact is the rationale for the graduated
                            increases in commitments of force—to demonstrate clearly our readiness
                            to assume the necessary risks of war.</p>
                        <p>This brings us back to the time requirement affecting the duration of
                            Phase II. Time is needed for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            military build-up—which is intended to bring pressure to bear on the
                            Soviets as well as prepare <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> for a
                            possible Phase III. The build-up itself is likely to have a deterrent
                            effect, and time is needed to measure its impact on Kremlin thinking.
                            And clearly, as tension mounts or the possibility of war increases, both
                            we and the Soviets will be under increasing pressures from all sides to
                            attempt to find a peaceful solution to the problem. This will take a
                            variety of forms, including possibly a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            involvement, and can go on for some time. At this juncture, two months
                            would appear to be a most conservative estimate. The probability is that
                            this exercise will be of much longer duration. Phase II is really
                            intended to induce the Soviets to agree to an acceptable modus vivendi;
                            it is not merely preparation time for Phase III when the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> contingency plans—the <gloss
                                target="#t_BERCONMARCON1">BERCON/MARCON</gloss> Plans—came into
                            play, although this is always a possible eventuality.</p>
                        <p>What is involved then is not a 60-day pause before active military
                            operations are undertaken, but rather a period in which major efforts
                            will be made backed by all possible means to achieve a political
                            solution to the Berlin problem. And as long as both sides seek to avoid
                            a military solution, Phase II need not be accelerated. Moreover, in so
                            far as Berlin itself is concerned, we can cope with an extended Phase II
                            for the stockpile and airlift capacities give us a cushion which permits
                            us to withstand substantial Soviet pressure.</p>

                        <p>I agree that serious crisis over Berlin unlikely before late fall
                            although gradual buildup of tension probable. Timing may be related to
                            next round Soviet atomic tests as they may hope soften up Western
                            position by exploding large bomb. I have not changed my views on
                            probable course of developments Berlin question, namely: increased
                            tension; at some stage serious attempt negotiate with US which probably
                            unsuccessful; direct approach to West Germans, also unsuccessful;
                            signature of peace treaty but with some steps to avoid or at least
                            reduce danger of military conflict. At some stage along way, consider
                            play for summit conference or bilateral meeting with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> likely. I find difficult to
                            assess reasons for <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            publicly emphasizing issue of troop withdrawal. He must surely know our
                            position is firm and while possible he is building this up for
                            bargaining purposes it does not seem reasonable that he would wish
                            further to commit his personal prestige which already deeply engaged. I
                            am more inclined to think he considers successful negotiations
                            impossible and is building up his position for signature of treaty.</p>
                        <p>Am inclined think Soviet position on test ban may have changed in recent
                            months in manner to make possibility agreement more likely. Believe
                            possible Soviets may have concluded that in view strain on their
                            resources continuation of competition in this field more likely to
                            result in breakthrough by us than by them. They would in any event
                            insist upon further Soviet round of tests before agreement became
                            effective.</p>

                            tomorrow evening for more considered reply to his closing remarks. Four
                            Foreign Ministers agreed we should not take excessively serious view
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statements today
                            but should continue talks. Soviet sources are hinting that <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will make new proposals about
                            Tuesday but no reliable indication thus far.</p>
                        <p>Do not believe I can report any significant change in regard to Berlin
                            nor do I need further instructions at this point. It was consensus of
                            Foreign Ministers that Soviets are maximizing pressures at this point to
                            discover any chink in our armor on troop question and that it is
                            essential to stand completely firm on this point. This seemed only
                            chance to pull Soviets off separate peace treaty line. If despite this
                            they should go ahead with separate peace treaty it was agreed firm stand
                            on troops now would make them more cautious as to accompanying measures
                            affecting our vital interests.</p>
                        <p>Four Western Foreign Ministers agreed to urgent review both political
                            planning and sequence of events prior to military confrontation. I drew
                            their attention specifically to consideration of Western political
                            initiatives prior to possible separate peace treaty such as three-power
                                <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0259"/>demarche to Moscow pointing
                            out that publicly announced separate peace treaty could in no way affect
                            rights of West in West Berlin. Encouraging to find Couve participating
                            fully in our discussion and got impression he continues to want to move
                            toward rejoining Allies on Berlin and German questions.</p>

                            shall have at least one more talk here. I clearly got impression that
                            they expect additional discussions here or later but this is no
                            guarantee that they will not make sudden move to press sudden and
                            separate peace treaty. However, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> last evening both in manner and words seemed to
                            emphasize their preference for an agreed solution and this I
                            reciprocated.</p>
                        <p>Most important point arose when I, after consultation with Western <gloss
                                target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss>s, asked him very directly and
                            specifically what he meant day before when he said that they “would sign
                            peace treaty with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and would carry
                            out necessary measures to provide for undeviating respect for <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty.” His first reply was that
                            this meant that after peace treaty Western Powers would have to make
                            their arrangements with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. I flatly
                            rejected this as an answer saying that he was merely saying “go ask the
                            ventriloquist’s dummy” and that I knew that Soviets would not be so
                            insane as to transfer such vital matter into the hands of <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>. He refused to answer again
                            except to repeat what he had said earlier. I suspect this means either
                            that he had no instructions at all or that Soviet Govt has not really
                            made up its mind.</p>
                        <p>In general, tone of meeting last evening was somewhat better than day
                            before and I got no impression that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> was here to deliver us an ultimatum involving

                                >Bohlen</persName>:</p>
                        <p>In view of shortage of time and necessity of it reaching you before your
                            next meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, it has
                            not had White House clearance, therefore represents only Department
                            view.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s comments in your two
                            meetings do not add any factual material or any new arguments which
                            would be of assistance in making a new evaluation of Soviet intentions.
                            General tenor of the conversation seems to us to stick squarely on
                            previous positions but is presented in a somewhat more definitive way in
                            regard to the signature of a separate peace treaty. It is likewise
                            noticed that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> read from a
                            paper which would indicate that he was operating under instructions from
                            highest authority, but it is also noted that he tended to back away at
                            end of first conversation on the threat aspect of his remarks. It is
                            also significant that he put no time limit or date in regard to the
                            signature of a peace treaty and was even more evasive when pressed as to
                            exactly what would be its consequences other than implication of his
                            remark that arrangements would have to be made with <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and not with Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Despite generally tougher line, it is no more possible now than it was
                            earlier to make any accurate prediction as to course of Soviet future
                                <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0261"/>action and we are still
                            inclined to believe that Soviets have not definitely made up their mind
                            on this aspect.</p>
                        <p>The threat of Soviet action and the constant repetition about the
                            necessity of removal of Western troops would seem to be in line with
                            recent indications from Moscow of Soviet position. It is possible that
                            this line is dictated by a desire to probe in depth the Western position
                            and when satisfied that there is no give to use this as a justification
                            for an eventual separate peace treaty.</p>
                        <p>Another conceivable but less likely motivation is that a strong negative
                            Western attitude might be utilized by the Soviets as an argument against
                            those elements within the communist bloc (in particular East Germans) or
                            even within the Soviet Government who have been pressing for a radical
                            solution of Berlin question. A strong Western attitude would demonstrate
                            that any radical solution carries with it a great risk of war. We are
                            unable to carry the analysis any farther.</p>
                        <p>It is of course conceivable that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> may show some more flexibility in your next
                            meeting with him, which we understand is at noon, Geneva time, tomorrow.
                            We have noted that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> has
                            referred to the removal of Western forces as the “crucial point” of
                            discussion. You might care at the next session if he sticks to this
                            point to say that you had already given all the arguments as to why this
                            was quite inconceivable for Western acceptance and in general shorten
                            the conversation if there seems to be no Soviet give and tell <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> you would report his attitude
                            to the President on your return and suggest that he should do the same

                            Following are my personal comments on three sessions taken together in
                            an attempt to help judge where we are.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Stiffest moment was at end first session when <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> read from his piece of
                                paper. Otherwise our discussions in all three sessions were in more
                                relaxed tones even if business-like atmosphere. This means that what
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> has said in his
                                own formulations has been more moderate than language used publicly
                                by Soviets in this past month.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>As you will see from record I threw two ideas into the pot in
                                third session. First, that Soviets use with East Germans same
                                techniques we used in 1949 with West Germans in reserving our rights
                                with respect to Berlin, a German peace treaty and Germany as a
                                whole. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> seemed to
                                reject this suggestion, claiming that in absence of prior agreement
                                West would have to deal with East Germans. At later stage, however,
                                he showed some interest in more information on this point and I am
                                not at all sure that this approach is foreclosed.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>My second point was to refer to the use of Deputy Foreign
                                Ministers for further discussion on German-Berlin questions along
                                lines our “principles” paper. Fortunately I was able to tie this to
                                an earlier remark he had dropped at luncheon table that they thought
                                it was important to talk these matters out with US or “better still
                                with the US, UK and France”. He inquired whether by Deputy Foreign
                                Ministers we meant bilateral or quadripartite and what they would
                                talk about. I told him I could not today speak officially for other
                                governments but our own idea was that these should be quadripartite,
                                that some of the questions to be discussed have been formulated in
                                our “principles” paper but that we could review agenda of Deputies
                                if that seemed desirable or necessary. He said that he would not
                                wish to comment on that suggestion today, thereby leaving door open
                                either for instructions or later discussion.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Note that insistence by Soviets that, after East German peace
                                treaty, the Western Powers would be required to deal with East
                                Germans <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0263"/>is a proposition
                                that seems to assume the continued presence of the West in West
                                Berlin. I do not, therefore, believe that we should think that we
                                are being presented with ultimatum which makes the actual presence
                                of the West the breaking point.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>He told me today that, upon returning from our last session in
                                Geneva, he had gone directly to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                    >Khrushchev</persName> and had obtained the suspension of
                                harassments in Berlin. This may be of some interest as indication
                                possible <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> influence
                                and effect of his judgment as to whether it is possible to back us
                                down in negotiations on presence Western troops.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Today I returned to a formulation I used some months ago with
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, namely, to try
                                to imagine the situation if <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                    >Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                    >Kennedy</persName> were to say to each other what we both had
                                been saying. I pointed out that it would be very bad to reach such
                                an unsatisfactory result. You will see from detailed record that
                                matter again came up at the end in terms of keeping contact between
                                our two governments. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                                seemed genuinely disturbed when he, through a complete
                                misunderstanding, thought I was suggesting that even diplomatic or
                                indirect contacts not be maintained. I promptly reassured him on
                                that point but his anxiety, linked with other things he has been
                                saying, reinforces our analysis that he was under instructions to
                                see how far he could go in talking us out of Berlin but not to let
                                the matter come to a complete impasse. I also added, of course, that
                                on the matter of possible meeting between <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> I would not add any
                                comments, without the instructions of the President, to what had
                                been said publicly and privately. He did not himself raise or pursue
                                “summit.”</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>I have tried to be very direct and very clear about the point of
                                Western forces in West Berlin and reminded him today that the
                                President had told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                    >Khrushchev</persName> that “no President of the United States
                                could make such a concession.” Such direct statements made more than
                                once did not bring further threatening language from <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. Indeed, the only threats
                                he used were those in his prepared portion of our first
                                session.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>It seems to me that there may be a possibility to work out an
                                arrangement with the Russians governing a post peace treaty
                                situation which the Russians themselves would agree with the East
                                Germans. They could claim that East German agreement was an exercise
                                of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and our rights would remain
                                intact. Alternatively, I think our modus vivendi approach may have a
                                breath of life. Further, there is always “Solution C”<note n="2"

                            <item>Home, <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName>,
                                and <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> have all left
                                Geneva. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is
                                tentatively planning to return to Moscow on the 26th. I am under the
                                definite impression that these talks at Geneva are not our last
                                opportunity for a settlement and that further communication would
                                precede drastic act on their part. I therefore told him that I would
                                tentatively plan to leave late tomorrow but that I would be in touch
                                with him tomorrow morning to see whether either one of us felt that
                                there were any other points we might profitably cover here. My guess
                                is that it would be a good thing for both Moscow and Washington to
                                do a little fresh thinking about these three sessions. It is
                                unlikely that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will
                                receive different instructions while <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                    >Khrushchev</persName> is away from Moscow.</item>

                            <item>I regret inability to button up this problem at this point but I
                                suspect that Soviets have not made their final decisions and have
                                been trying to find out whether additional public and private
                                pressure could produce significant Western concessions. I could be
                                wrong and Soviets could move toward a peace treaty at almost any
                                time but it does not feel that way to me.</item>

                            <item>Of some interest is my very private remark to Polish Foreign
                                Minister Rapacki that now is a good time for those who have
                                influence in Moscow to counsel moderation and he replied “you may be
                                sure that is being done.” Today, after a rather sharp retort to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> during my brief
                                remarks in the disarmament conference, the Polish chief delegate
                                remarked privately to one of my colleagues that I had made a “fine
                                statement.”</item>

                            <item>There has been good feeling among four Western Foreign Ministers
                                at Geneva and unity on the line to take at this point as well as on
                                necessary urgent review of Western position on contingency planning.
                                This plus fact that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                                keeps door open encourages me to think that additional patience may
                                work this out, distressing as it is to listen to and to play certain

                        <p>Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName> had two and half hour
                            session with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, Ilyichev,
                            and Kovalev following lunch hosted by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            invited Secretary speak first.</p>
                        <p>Secretary opened saying he little puzzled as to what <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and he could profitably say to
                            each other at this point. Problems at hand had been discussed at
                            considerable length here and US point of view had also been expressed by
                            President on number occasions. Secretary noted he had reported to
                            President what had been said in Geneva and that he personally did not
                            see any prospect for satisfactory progress on issues at this time,
                            unless Sovs advance in one of two directions: (A) To make clear that
                            whatever they thought needs were with respect East Germany these would
                            not interfere with Western presence in West Berlin and access to that
                            city. On larger questions in which there is common interest between US
                            and USSR, West had made clear to West Germany that all-German problems
                            and Berlin reserved from full sovereignty West Germany. We saw no reason
                            why Sovs could not do same with respect East Germany. (B) Alternatively,
                            we could try to sit down and see how to handle fact of disagreement
                            without conflict. US general principles paper suggested one way to
                            dealing with it. If there were other suggestions re handling this matter
                            in similar fashion, we would be happy think about them.</p>
                        <p>Secretary expressed view great deal of time had been spent in these
                            discussions reviewing respective points of view and it was not necessary
                            go over them again since they well known. Problem is where we should go
                            from here.</p>
                        <p>Secretary observed that in terms of longer-run future, if there was no
                            permanent settlement German problems on agreed basis, that was likely
                            cause restiveness and be source of danger Central Europe. Sincerely, as
                            we saw situation, if Germans stood against Germans and if Germans on
                            both sides were to indulge in adventures, that would gravely affect
                            peace Central Europe. We regard effective presence US and indeed USSR as
                            stabilizing factor in this situation.</p>
                        <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0266"/>
                        <p>Secretary recalled <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                            remark at lunch it good idea if US and USSR, and preferably also UK and
                            France, tried discuss these problems and find solution. US had made
                            suggestion along these lines in its general principles paper. Noting he
                            was unable speak with full authority for two additional countries,
                            particularly since—as <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            aware from reading newspapers—<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> had his own views this subject, Secretary stated
                            that if Sovs had any ideas for quadripartite discussions along lines we
                            had been talking about, we would see what could be done to get
                            cooperation others concerned.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said he wished add one word re President and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. Noting he had already
                            exchanged some comments on this point with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>, Secretary said he believed great deal depended
                            on whether these two men could find some basis on which our two
                            countries, in spite their different social systems, could move toward
                            better relations. However, he also believed it would be unfortunate if
                            President and <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> just
                            exchanged views on this subject without coming to any apparent result.
                            US had tried be imaginative as to how circumstances could be created
                            where direct contact between these two men could take place fruitfully.
                            However, Secretary said, he did not think such circumstances existed
                            now, and there was danger two leaders reaching same point where we were
                            now, which would not be satisfactory to either side. Secretary pointed
                            out that he was making these comments only in connection his earlier
                            conversation on this subject, and that he had no direct instructions
                            from President in this respect.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agreed both he and
                            Secretary had set forth in detail and in clear manner positions their
                            respective govts during these meetings in Geneva. He wished once more
                            emphasize that Sovs regretted US Govt had taken such position re main
                            problems, i.e., withdrawal Western forces from West Berlin. He contended
                            this was further evidence US Govt’s desire maintain occupation status in
                            West Berlin and keep that city in hands three Western Powers as <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> mil base. This conclusion had not
                            been arrived at today; USSR had thought so before, but today Western
                            intentions this respect were even clearer than before. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> observed he had made this
                            comment in view Secretary’s remark at earlier meeting Sovs had only
                            recently started talking about West Berlin’s being <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> continued USSR would never agree to perpetuation
                            occupation regime in West Berlin and to that city’s remaining <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base eternally. USSR could not agree
                            to that because that ran counter interests of peace in Europe—and not
                            only in Europe—but also counter interests relaxation tensions in Europe
                            and Germany. If Sovs were to agree to this they would be helping those
                            who were pouring oil on fire and thus would be accomplices of West
                            German revanchists and militarists. It was impossible expect Sov Union
                            to agree to this. USSR <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0267"/>would
                            not agree and regretted US Govt, and apparently its Allies, failed duly
                            appreciate this position.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> recalled that on more than
                            one occasion Western, including US leaders, for example <persName
                                corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1"
                                >De Gaulle</persName>, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName>, and Secretary himself, had stated West
                            understood Sov desire ensure its security, particularly in light lessons
                            past history, when Hitler had attacked USSR and latter had lost millions
                            of lives in defeating Nazis. However, while saying this, West failed
                            draw necessary conclusions which would lend substance to these words.
                            USSR position re German peace treaty and other questions to be settled
                            in connection such treaty was based on desire prevent events in Europe
                            from taking tragic turn and causing new disaster in world. Sov Govt and
                            Sov people were resolved to go through with this and they believed this
                            was in accord with interests peace in Europe and in world at large, as
                            well as with US interests, if such interests were correctly understood.
                            If US was seeking peace and good relations with USSR, this should not be
                            in conflict with its interests. USSR, just as US, was great power and if
                            it was interested—as it had to be—in matters of war and peace in all
                            corners of world, including Africa and Asia, then it was easy to
                            understand reasons why it was doubly interested in events in Europe.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> went on, saying another
                            aspect problem was that in pres-ent situation where there was no German
                            peace treaty and West Berlin was occupied city in hands Western Powers,
                            sovereign rights of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> were being
                            crudely flouted. USSR was fully aware of US dislike for <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, its system, its govt, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> personally. However, this was
                            something that did not depend on US; fact was that <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, its govt, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> existed. Admitting he might be
                            repetitive, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated West
                            Berlin did not belong to West and there was no reason why US, UK and
                            France should stay as bosses of West Berlin. Neither USSR, nor <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, nor some other states could reconcile
                            themselves with present state of affairs. It appeared to Sovs West
                            failed appreciate duly these arguments which USSR had been advancing in
                            its quest for mutually agreeable solution.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> observed that every once
                            in a while US attempted link question German peace treaty and
                            normalization situation West Berlin with question German reunification.
                            He supposed that was done only for record. In his view this was waste of
                            time and energy. New situation existed in Germany today; two German
                            states had emerged from ruins Hitler’s Reich and it was from this fact
                            that one must proceed. USSR was convinced unification would be resolved
                            only between two German states. On other hand question German peace
                            treaty and normalization West Berlin situation could not be postponed
                            indefinitely. It was this that he had wanted particularly emphasized in
                            his conversations with Secy here in Geneva. It was regrettable US failed
                            draw necessary conclusions <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0268"/>from
                            this. USSR was convinced its position correct and in full accord with
                            interests peace and detente in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Referring to Secy’s remark it would be well if USSR made clear in one or
                            two directions what situation would exist with regard to presence
                            Western Powers and Western forces West Berlin in event Sovs went through
                            with their intentions re German peace settlement, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> contended he had spoken on this
                            during his meetings with Secy in New York and later in Geneva. During
                            present conversations, he had also twice replied to this question. He
                            continued that, if understanding was reached on appropriate questions
                            connected with German peace settlement, situation would be simple:
                            Access would be unrestricted and it would be ensured by all parties
                            concerned, including <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> fulfilling its
                            obligations; it would be ensured on basis respect <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty, including its sovereignty
                            with regard transit. A different situation would exist if peace treaty
                            with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> were signed unilaterally, i.e.,
                            without Western Powers’ participation or without agreement with those
                            powers; then West would have to deal with <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> Govt re all questions, including transit arrangements;
                            USSR would have nothing to do with these. Only <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> would be responsible and Western Powers would have to
                            deal with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>As to Secretary’s remarks about desirability avoid conflict, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asserted Sov Govt had always
                            proceeded on that basis. Sov Govt believed both sides must do their
                            utmost to avoid conflict. Sov Govt believed conflict could be caused
                            only by Western Powers, US in particular, due to their position. If USSR
                            wanted create conflict for sake of conflict it would have acted
                            differently, and it would have had no prolonged negotiations with US in
                            order seek possibility agreed solution.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> recalled that, last March
                            in Geneva, Secy had spoken to him about Sovt flights in air corridors to
                            West Berlin. Secy had said these flights were complicating matters and
                            it would be better if they stopped. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> continued that, although USSR categorically
                            rejected assertion that such flights were illegal, upon his return to
                            Moscow he had reported Secy’s remarks on this point to Sov Govt and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> personally. He had
                            told his govt that President apparently shared Secy’s views on this
                            matter, but although both of them were wrong, they did appear feel this
                            was complicating factor for them. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had then replied that suspension such flights
                            might perhaps facilitate negotiations, and had ordered them suspended
                            (at this point <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> told his
                            interpreter not to use “stopped” but rather “suspended” in this
                            sentence). <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said Sovs had
                            not expected US to express special gratitude to USSR for this. US had
                            taken this for granted, although perhaps it had noted this in its own
                            mind. He had made these remarks by way of reply to Secretary’s comment
                            re need not do anything to heighten conflict. <pb n="247"
                                xml:id="pg_247" facs="0269"/><persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> reiterated that if Sovs had wanted conflict they
                            would have been acting differently. However, not to want conflict for
                            sake of conflict was one thing; it was another thing when legitimate
                            interests of USSR and legitimate interests of <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> as sovereign state were affected, interests which were
                            in full accord with interests of peace.</p>
                        <p>Commenting on Secy’s remark that present circumstances did not favor
                            direct contact between President and <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> noted that this was apparently Secy’s view on
                            this point and that Secy was of course free draw conclusions from
                            situation as he saw it. US knew Sov positions, including its latest
                            proposal re Western forces West Berlin, well enough and there was
                            nothing he, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, could add.
                            He did wish repeat however that he regretted very much US was taking
                            such position re Western forces West Berlin. He wished emphasize with
                            all vigor Sov Govt would never, never agree with that position and would
                            never accept perpetuation presence Western troops West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Secy said he wished make observation re <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>’s very last point, because he believed he should
                            draw distinction between contacts, i.e., communication, and a situation
                            where we would have to imagine what the two leaders could say if they
                            met face to face. This was of course up to the President, but he thought
                            that contacts, i.e., communication, were of very considerable
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>Referring to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s remark that
                            Western attitude on presence forces West Berlin had been distinct in
                            past but not as distinct as it was today, Secy first observed he
                            understood word today to mean recent days. He then recalled that
                            pressure on this point had come from Sov side in most recent
                            conversations. Of course insistence on part USSR clarified and made more
                            distinct basis attitude Western Powers. Secy pointed out President had
                            said in Vienna no US President was in position make this kind of
                            surrender Western position in present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Secy said he was again sorry hear words such as “eternal” and “perpetual”
                            being used in connection presence Western forces. No one had said such
                            presence should be eternal or perpetual. What we had said was that USSR
                            could not unilaterally, by itself, say when it should end. To say West
                            insisting on staying perpetually in Berlin was incorrect and
                            misrepresentation Western position.</p>
                        <p>Recalling <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s comment
                            Western leaders had expressed understanding USSR desire ensure its
                            security, Secy stressed this understanding did not mean that, if Sovs
                            alleged basic rights of West were some kind of vague threat to their
                            security, they could expect US move out at risk of catastrophe to West
                            with regard to its security. Secy said he wished assure genuine
                            understanding Sov security did not mean West would lie down and play
                            dead when alleged Sov security at stake.</p>
                        <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0270"/>
                        <p>As to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s remark that talk
                            about unification was waste time and energy, Secy stated Sov position
                            today inevitably led to conclusion Sovs wanted brush aside all
                            agreements they had concluded with West between World War II and middle
                            “fifties” and that apparently their solemn assurances were valueless
                            because they wished change situation to their advantage in spite of fact
                            that would violate Western vital interests. Secy strongly emphasized we
                            were not children and understood situation. If Sovs intended throw
                            existing agreements into junk heap, no one could expect West to think
                            any new agreement re presence and access West Berlin would have solid
                            backing unless Western Powers were in West Berlin. As to <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s assertion there was new
                            situation in Germany characterized particularly by existence <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_UW1"
                                >Ulbricht</persName>, Secy stressed there was another element in
                            that situation, i.e., presence Western Powers in West Berlin with access
                            thereto, which had not changed, was part of situation, and was as much
                            of a fact as any other facts cited. Sovs said that when peace treaty was
                            signed by them, these questions would be for <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> to deal with and Sovs would have no relation to them.
                            Surely this was not accurate description their position. We could not
                            believe Sovs would indeed turn over what they say are their security
                            interests to <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> himself had said USSR would be
                            involved in situation in case of trouble. In any event concern with
                            situation must remain between signatories to agreements. As far as we
                            were concerned USSR and West continue be responsible for situation. We
                            see no way Sovs could, would or would want to transfer this
                            responsibility to another entity.</p>
                        <p>Re <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s assertion there was
                            dangerous situation in Berlin, Secretary pointed out source of danger
                            easy to identify. There had been no source of war in that area for a
                            number of years, even since Jessup-Malik agreement, which had relieved
                            dangerous tensions and which Sovs now want throw out window. Danger or
                            threat did not come from our side but from East, because Sovs said
                            unless you do this we will make situation dangerous. West made no
                            demands and was not asking anything. Source of danger came from source
                            of demands. If that was peace or peaceful coexistence, Secretary
                            emphasized, then he did not understand those words. This lack of regard
                            for interests and position other side was element lack of reciprocity we
                            had been concerned about in recent discussions. Secretary agreed Berlin
                            was serious problem.</p>
                        <p>However, he pointed out, it was also true there were other problems, some
                            connected with Germany and some not. Prudence required not to translate
                            Berlin problem into sole determining issue in US–USSR relations. It was
                            not only issue on US–USSR agenda. Perhaps progress could be made on
                            other problems. However, if Berlin problem was treated without any
                            element reciprocity, then indeed it was major issue between US–USSR.</p>
                        <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0271"/>
                        <p>As to corridor flights, Secretary said he had been very much aware of
                            difference in situation this respect after his departure Geneva.
                            However, since he had no way of knowing <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> had intervened, and since he was not sure
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to be
                            personally cognizant of situation—something the Sov <gloss
                                target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss> did not want in Geneva—he had not
                            communicated with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on this
                            point. However, Secretary wished express gratification at hearing
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s remarks, and
                            thought this had been positive and helpful act on his part.</p>
                        <p>Secretary recalled he had made two remarks re possible ways dealing with
                            matters at hand.</p>
                        <p>One way would be for USSR to make clear its possible actions re East
                            Germany would not affect rights Western Powers and access. From what
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said he
                            apparently did not think well of this suggestion. However, Secretary
                            pointed out, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was trying
                            make East Germany more sovereign than West Germany. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said USSR would back up
                            East Germany with regard steps East Germany would take in exercising
                            that kind of sovereignty. Of course that would lead to very dangerous
                            situation, and was unwise on part USSR. The second way—possible
                            discussions including UK and France—US had made certain suggestions re
                            Deputy Foreign Ministers. Secretary wondered whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had any suggestions of his
                            own.</p>
                        <p>Secretary then expressed view point had been reached where, unless there
                            were new instructions received, both sides should report in detail to
                            their governments, give serious thought to what had been said, and be in
                            touch again, as he was sure two Heads of Government would want them to
                            be. Secretary expressed regret it had so far been impossible make
                            serious advance in Geneva, despite demonstration great efforts on our
                            side during past months find mutually acceptable solution. Sovs now
                            concentrating on point of most vital interest to West. Western position
                            on this had been made clear to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> by President in Vienna. Indeed it had been
                            clear since events of 1948/49, and therefore our attitude could not
                            possibly be surprise to USSR. Secretary continued that, in view what had
                            been said, he saw no direction in which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> and he could go ahead here in Geneva. He
                            wondered what <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s view was
                            on this.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> rejoined by referring to
                            Secretary’s remark USSR security considerations with regard German peace
                            treaty and normalization West Berlin situation were vague and
                            represented very free and easy interpretation Sov arguments in favor
                            German peace treaty and normalization West Berlin situation on basis
                            free city.</p>
                        <p>There was nothing vague or nebulous in this. In fact everything was
                            crystal clear. There was this intolerable situation where West Berlin
                            was held by Western Powers in their fists and maintained as <gloss

                            nothing nebulous; these represented weighty arguments militating in

                            changed, with or without prior understanding with Western Powers.
                            However, USSR believed it would be best have solution with prior
                            understanding with Western Powers.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said Secretary had tried
                            present situation in such way as to make it look as if creation two
                            Germanies had been caused by USSR’s violation its solemn obligations.
                            This was inaccurate. It had been Western Powers, and only Western Powers
                            which had torn up agreements between Allies and had split Germany. It
                            was on this basis that two German states had emerged. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said there was no need
                            reminding Secretary of creation such things as Bizonia or Trizonia, nor
                            of creation of revanchist, militarist, but independent <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. There was no need to review history.
                            USSR had been from very outset in favor creation single, peaceful
                            Germany, but that had not been possible due to Western Powers.
                            Apparently no common language could be found on this point. Secretary
                            repeated himself and so apparently did he, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>, too. However, since Secretary had raised point,
                            it was necessary to restore history, i.e., truth.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> contended USSR would
                            always remember how its Allies in war had acted with respect their
                            commitments as Allies. Hardly was ink dry on those agreements and hardly
                            had first grass grown on graves millions of dead, when West started
                            crudely to flout all its agreements with USSR, which duty bound remember
                            this and draw necessary conclusions. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> asserted this was road that had led to present
                            situation. This all a very sad story, but must be taken into
                            account.</p>
                        <p>Recalling Secretary’s statement about transfer USSR security interests to
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> asserted this question did not arise at all.
                            USSR did not intend to transfer its security. However, USSR had mutual
                            obligations to certain states, including those under Warsaw Pact, and in
                            event any aggression against <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, USSR
                            would meet its obligation under Warsaw Pact. As to USSR, its security
                            was firmly in its own hands.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then referred to
                            Secretary’s remark Sovs trying make <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            more sovereign than <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and wondered why
                            Secretary thought <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should be
                            yardstick of sovereignty for <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. If
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> not fully sovereign, if West had
                            pocketed part its sovereignty, why should <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> take its cue from that? In any event question of
                            greater or lesser sovereignty out of place. Sovereignty was sovereignty,
                            and could not be cut up in pieces and placed on different shelves. It
                            had been known for a long time that, if any sovereign state agreed yield
                            some of its sovereign rights by voluntarily entering into international
                            agreements to this effect, this was exercise of sovereignty.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then observed Secretary
                            had for second time advanced idea continuation discussion by Deputy
                            Foreign Ministers. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0273"/>said he had two comments: He
                            was not clear what Secretary had in mind—bilateral or broader
                            discussions? Also he was not clear what Deputy Foreign Ministers would
                            have to do. He said this suggestion would remain unanswered by USSR here
                            in Geneva for time being. Secretary wondered whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s last sentence referred to
                            four Deputy Foreign Ministers or to bilateral contacts. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied he was talking about
                            Secretary’s specific reference to Deputy Foreign Ministers. As to
                            contacts, Secretary had said present circumstances not conducive to
                            direct contact Heads of Government, but he understood this did not mean
                            indirect contacts should not continue.</p>
                        <p>Secretary confirmed <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                            understanding on latter point, while noting he could not speak for
                            President formally. Re Deputy Foreign Ministers, US had made some
                            general suggestions as to what Deputy Foreign Ministers could discuss.
                            We had in mind Four Powers responsible for questions relating to
                            Germany; however, Secretary noted, he would have be in touch with those
                            not present here. Secretary expressed view it was important in not too
                            distant future agree on appropriate tasks for Deputy Foreign Ministers.
                            Some such tasks were contained in US general principles paper given to
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> during previous
                            meeting in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>Secretary then noted <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had
                            referred to Sov insistence re “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            interests.” He wished to remind <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> there were number other interests, such as those
                            of US and its Allies, Germany and German people as whole, West
                            Berliners, and peoples of USSR and US, all of whom interested in not
                            allowing major crisis develop. It was clear <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> interests not paramount when vast interests were at
                            stake in this situation. Secretary agreed there was no use in talking
                            about degrees of sovereignty. However, point he had wished make was that
                            Western Powers reserved re West Germany certain points with regard this
                            situation, and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had in
                            fact praised this as something constructive. We had also reserved re
                            West Germany points regarding settlement German problem as whole. In
                            reply <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s inquiry re
                            specific points, <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> pointed
                            out Western Powers in their agreement with West Germany had reserved all
                            matters relating to Berlin, peace settlement, and Germany as whole.
                            Secretary said he wished simply point out this possibility was open to
                            USSR as well.</p>
                        <p>Re <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s remark grant of
                            rights also represented exercise of sovereignty Secretary said he agreed
                            with this and recalled that US had told USSR that, if it signed treaty
                            with East Germany and if East Germany said to USSR what was in <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>-<persName>Bolz</persName>
                            agreement, that would also be exercise of sovereignty. If, e.g., France
                            agreed to flights by aircraft from London to Rome, even if such aircraft
                            did not touch ground in France, that was also exercise of sovereignty.
                            Secretary observed he understood <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> not in position comment on question Deputy
                            Foreign <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0274"/>Ministers today.
                            Meanwhile we would give more precise thought this question and we would
                            be in touch with other side.</p>
                        <p>Secretary then raised question schedule. Said in normal course he would
                            return to Washington tomorrow, to be there in time for his dinner for
                            Souvanna Phouma July 26. This was not categorical imperative for him.
                            However, he had rather gathered impression both sides had said all they
                            could here, and perhaps it would be desirable for each to consult own
                            government. It would be useful if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> could say when he was leaving for Moscow, and
                            whether he thought they should be in touch again before he left.
                            Secretary noted he would be able to stay if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> thought he would have anything further from
                            Moscow to discuss before leaving Geneva, and of course would be in touch
                            if he had anything new from Washington.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> referred to Secretary’s
                            comment <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> interests could not be
                            compared with Western interests, and thought Secretary probably regarded
                            Western interests as big mountain and <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> interests as small pebble. While it true US great power
                            and bigger than <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, any state, even
                            small, considered its own interests, close and vital to it. Moreover
                            when Sovs spoke of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> interests, they
                            had in mind vital, fundamental interests <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>, since West Berlin in center <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> and all air, land and water communications to West
                            Berlin ran through <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> territory.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> reiterated suggestion
                            re Deputy Foreign Ministers would remain unanswered for time being. Re
                            schedule, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> indicated he
                            tentatively planning leave July 26. However, if interests negotiations
                            warranted longer stay and if further meeting agreed, he would not
                            object. Thus whether further meeting will take place depended not only
                            on him but on Secretary as well. Meeting closed with agreement two
                            delegations would check in morning whether anything new on either
                            side.</p>

                            after our Congressional elections. He did not want to make things more

                        <p>I said I would of course inform President but I could tell him that any
                            crisis—and particularly one as dangerous as would arise over
                            Berlin—would unite both parties in a demonstration of their patriotism.
                            He then asked if settlement of such a question as Berlin would not be
                            helpful to President politically. I said that in my opinion there was no

                            necessary to hold to any fixed date—and that it was even not necessarily
                            essential that matter be settled before end of this year.</p>

                        <p>228. My conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>—Berlin.</p>
                        <p>I started to take my leave of K but he said he had additional subject to
                            discuss even though he disliked bringing up unpleasant matter on my last
                            visit. He had read report first <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            conversation and half of second but it was already clear our dialogue
                            was coming to end. He would have no choice but to proceed with signature
                            of treaty after which our rights there, including right of access, would
                            end. He emphasized that East Germans were allies and Soviets would stand
                            by them. On this occasion and others in conversation he showed great
                            sensitivity to what he considered threats and said Soviet Union great
                            power, not small country which could be threatened with impunity.
                            President had suggested time would make solution easier but he could not
                            wait indefinitely. From some things Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName> had said, we apparently had idea of unending talks,
                            but this not acceptable. Soviet Govt had tried many different proposals
                            to find solution but we insisted on maintaining occupation in center of
                            sovereign <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0276"/>
                        <p>I replied Secretary discussing this matter with <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and in any event our position
                            had been made so clear there was little I could add. I pointed out
                            however that in 1959 we had endeavored to meet Soviet problem and find
                            ways to take Berlin out of cold war. These proposals had not been
                            accepted. It was Soviet side and not we that had focused world attention
                            on Berlin to point where smallest thing became test of our intentions. I
                            pointed out that psychology of people of Berlin and West Germany had
                            become very important. Many people on our side felt that acceptance of
                            Soviet proposals meant we would lose not only Berlin but rest of Germany
                            and consequently all of Europe. I said that they and we knew what
                                <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> wanted in West
                            Berlin. K had himself said that our troops in Berlin had no military
                            value and we agreed with this appraisal, but they were essential to
                            maintain confidence of people of Berlin.</p>
                        <p>K said we often referred to prestige but did not take into account
                            prestige of Soviet Union. Continuance of occupation would be humiliating
                            to East Germany and Soviet Union. He said we also referred to our
                            commitment to people of Berlin but we had no right to make such
                            commitment when it involved interests of Allies who had made enormous
                            sacrifices in war. I said I thought in matters of this kind it was
                            important to try to get other person’s point of view. I asked him what
                            he would do if he had Soviet troops in similar situation and we said we
                            would cut them off. I knew he would respond that he would sign treaty
                            and withdraw (before interpreter reached this sentence K interjected to
                            say exactly that). I got impression that this remark had some effect. K
                            said he was considering bringing matter before <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and in this connection made some vague reference to
                            possible commission of jurists—in order that Soviet Union could make
                            clear its position before signing treaty. He said he was discussing this
                            possibility with his colleagues but no decision had been taken and he
                            had not made up his own mind whether this was best course but it had
                            certain appeal for him.</p>
                        <p>K took usual line on German reunification.</p>
                        <p>This part of conversation ended by my telling him he should find way to
                            give us better choice of alternatives than those now before us and I
                            illustrated this with a long anecdote. He was cordial throughout
                            discussion and I had impression he considered he had to move ahead but
                            deeply troubled. He emphasized many times this was the one problem
                            standing in way of good relations between us and I believe he is sincere
                            in this.</p>
                        <p>I said I hoped he would study carefully reports <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> conversations as Secretary had fully set forth
                            our position. At dacha in afternoon he had <persName corresp="#p_SVS1"
                                >Semenov</persName>, their German expert, present, indicating he
                            expected continue Berlin talk, but did not do so in any specific
                            way.</p>

                        <p>76. Eyes only for the Secretary from Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>. Reflecting upon my talk with
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> have following
                            conclusions:</p>
                        <p>(1) Am more convinced than ever that he at least does not intend push
                            Berlin question to point of real risk of war. Much will depend, however,
                            upon attitude his colleagues and allies as well as upon how we handle
                            the matter. Believe line taken by President and your representation of
                            our case at Geneva was just right but suggest we must be extremely
                            careful on the one hand to show we are serious in our determination to
                            defend Berlin and on other to avoid engaging their prestige particularly
                            in the military field as they are unbelievably sensitive about this. I
                            think, for example, we should for the present play down any boasts about
                            our military superiority and in Berlin itself avoid any action that
                            could be considered by them as annoyance on our part. At same time we
                            should proceed vigorously with contingency planning which they will know
                            about but without publicity.</p>
                        <p>I believe <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> is likely to
                            bring Berlin problem before <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
                            probably will personally present Soviet case. Suggest we should be
                            thinking about how to prevent neutrals from proposing compromise
                            solutions unacceptable to us and from giving him impression he can
                            proceed with his plans with strong support from world opinion. I have
                            some thoughts on this to put before you upon my return.</p>

                            flights. To abandon flights, which had been made for many years, seemed
                            clearly unwise (as Bonn noted in <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1"

                                stressed that it should be viewed with caution since it could not be

                            seemed to be to fly at an early time brief, innocuous flight at high
                            altitude, and thereafter fly carefully spaced and controlled flights to
                            maintain our right to do so and to fulfill at same time intelligence
                            purposes. Brief flight of 13 minutes therefore flown today at altitudes
                            above 1000 feet avoiding Karlshorst area. It was without incident. Press
                            inquiries re possibility such flight having occurred have been answered
                            with statement that routine helicopter flights took place (many normally
                            occur each day over US Sector) but we do not divulge their routes.

                                Western Response to Peace Treaty</hi></p>
                        <p>The complex of assumptions underlying the specific plans for the Western
                            political and diplomatic response to the separate peace treaty, itself,
                            are as follows. The Western Powers must realistically assume that the
                            Soviets will probably carry out their announced intention to sign a
                            peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Available
                            political and economic countermeasures are insufficient to prevent the
                            signature of the treaty or to affect subsequent Soviet actions
                            appreciably. They would, in addition, probably have unacceptable side
                            effects. In these circumstances, Western reaction should be such that
                            the signing does not appear to constitute a victory for the Soviet bloc
                            such as the erection of the Wall was considered in some quarters. If the
                            Western Powers adopt a position of deep concern and foreboding over the
                            signing of a separate peace treaty, this will necessarily make that
                            signing appear to be a defeat of very substantial proportions. If the
                            Western Powers treat it, on the other hand, as an action which has no
                            necessary significance unless efforts are made to <pb n="258"
                                xml:id="pg_258" facs="0280"/>interfere with Western access rights,
                            there would be much less basis for assertions of a resounding loss.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, Western efforts should be directed toward minimizing the
                            importance of the treaty. To achieve this result, it is necessary to
                            establish widespread acceptance of the legal and political futility of
                            the act, and to limit states outside the Communist orbit from adhering
                            to, or supporting, the treaty. At the same time, the position should be
                            maintained that the conclusion of the separate peace treaty would be
                            another repudiation by the Soviets of their solemn obligations and of
                            basic international principles.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Assumption Underlying Plans for
                                Withdrawal of Soviets from Check Points</hi></p>
                        <p>If, at any time, it seems that the withdrawal by the Soviets from their
                            functions with respect to Allied access to Berlin is imminent, the three
                            Governments would presumably act in accordance with the agreed
                            contingency plans. The assumption underlying these plans is that the
                            Western Powers are prepared to accept execution of existing procedures
                            on ground access to Berlin by East German personnel substituting for
                            Soviet personnel.</p>
                        <p>This matter has been the subject of intensive unilateral and multipartite
                            discussion. From 1959 to 1961 the quadripartite position was that in the
                            absence of their explicit delegation as agents of the Soviets (which was
                            considered unlikely), East Germans would not be permitted to date-time
                            stamp Allied travel documents as the Soviets do. Instead there would be
                            instituted the so-called “peel-off” procedure, which in essence was
                            intended to identify Allied movements as being entitled to unrestricted
                            access to Berlin, and would have involved the handing over to East
                            German personnel at the check point of a copy of the Allied travel order
                            but would not accept stamping of a travel order as a condition of
                            passage. However, as the result of the <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
                                >Macmillan</persName> visit to Washington in the spring of 1961, and
                            after informal US discussion during the following months, the US and UK
                            revised their positions to permit implementation of existing procedures
                            by East German personnel. Persist-ent physical interference with access
                            to Berlin was chosen as the point at which the West would have to
                            demonstrate its determination. The French and Germans subsequently—and
                            somewhat unenthusiastic-ally—agreed. The essential argument in favor of
                            this position was that the earlier plans did not draw the line at a
                            point which would receive public understanding and support in that they
                            would involve a procedural innovation likely to give rise to criticism
                            that the West was making an issue over who stamped a document.</p>
                        <p>It was argued that a Western position of leaving well enough alone and
                            not being the one to demand a change in its favor would appear
                            reasonable and unprovocative, and that US allies would move to this <pb
                                n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0281"/>position in any event. There
                            would possibly be some questioning in the US press, public, and Congress
                            as to whether the most suitable breaking point had been chosen. There
                            would also be grave difficulties in making the US position plausible to
                            the uncommitted countries. All this would be apparent to the Soviets,
                            and they would be encouraged to press ahead to exploit the Western
                            disarray. In the face of Bloc pressures and Allied disunity, it seems
                            likely that the US, UK, and France would eventually accept the same
                            paper-stamping from the East Germans that they now accept from the
                            Soviets. It would be better to straighten this issue out beforehand to
                            avoid a last-minute change under fire.</p>
                        <p>Since the decision to accept East German stamping was made, both the US
                            Embassy in Bonn and the US Mission in Berlin have questioned it. Their
                            essential argument is that although who stamps a document is not a good
                            issue over which to use force if necessary, the issue is actually much
                            more than that and really boils down to whether or not the US, the UK,
                            and France are determined to maintain their right of free and
                            unrestricted ground access to Berlin. They argue: 1) that the question
                            of “persistent physical interference with access to Berlin” will never
                            arise; 2) that substitution of East German personnel will be the most
                            visible and objectionable single action that is ever taken by the
                            Soviets; and 3) that thereafter the East Germans will take one
                            infinitesimal step after another—each much less saleable as a breaking
                            point than substitution—until, over a period of time, by gradual erosion
                            Western ground access is completely at the mercy of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> regime. <persName

                            action in the period after the peace treaty will be so slow and
                            circumspect that the West will never be provided with a point at which
                            the use of force can be justified. Those who object to East German
                            stamping argue that it will lead at best to self-blockade on the ground
                            and at worst to de jure acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> or withdrawal from Berlin or eventually both.</p>
                        <p>Although these arguments have a certain weight, the point can be made
                            that there is nothing inevitable about the erosion of the Allied
                            position. The Soviets have had a similar eroding capacity since the
                            ending of the blockade in 1949. By being firm on essentials and skillful
                            in the handling of individual disputes, the Western Powers have
                            prevented any substantial erosion of their basic access rights. In a
                            number of cases present procedures are actually an improvement over
                            those which existed in the immediate post-blockade years. Hence, this
                            line of argument would go, there is no intrinsic reason why, by alert
                            reaction to attempts to change established procedures, the Western
                            Powers should not be able to preserve their essential access against
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> attempts to erode it, given, of
                            course, the continuing unwillingness on the Communist side to press any
                            specific dispute to the point of major confrontation.</p>

                        <p>Three stages are envisaged in the agreed contingency planning for the
                            treaty. The first is action, to be taken when indicated by events, to
                            prepare public opinion so that the conclusion of a separate peace treaty
                            will not be regarded as a Soviet victory. The second begins when
                            invitations are dispatched to a peace conference, or its organization is
                            announced. The third is after signature of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>For the first stage, guidelines have been prepared as the basis for a
                            series of high-level, authoritative public statements. These guidelines
                            set out the essential points that: 1) by the Bolz-<persName

                            of the traffic of the Western garrisons in Berlin which passes through
                            East Germany; 2) subsequently the Western Powers have continued to hold
                            the Soviet Government responsible when problems have arisen concerning
                            Berlin, communications therewith, or Germany as a whole; 3) the mere
                            conclusion of a purported “peace treaty” would not in any way change the
                            existing situation; and 4) the Western Powers will continue to look to
                            the Soviet Government to fulfill its responsibilities and will take
                            whatever action seems necessary and proper to the extent to which the
                            Soviet Government fails to do so.</p>
                        <p>In the second stage, representations would be made to the Governments of
                            all the states invited to attend the peace conference, which would
                            include suitable emphasis upon the legal arguments against a separate
                            peace. The representations would also develop the point that this treaty
                            would do nothing to establish peaceful conditions in Europe, but would
                            be much more likely to have precisely the opposite effect. Primary
                            responsibilities for representations to the Governments invited have
                            been assigned.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, the Three Powers and the Federal Republic would sent
                            notes to the Soviet Government covering the legal aspects and pointing
                            out to the Soviet Government its obligations arising out of Four Power
                            responsibility. Drafts of such notes have been prepared.</p>
                        <p>These notes would also be published as a statement of the Western
                            position. Supplemental talking points have been prepared for press
                            guidance and for use in discussions with the various countries invited
                            to the Soviet peace conference. For the third stage, after signature of
                            the treaty, a draft has been prepared for a statement to be made by the
                            Three Powers in conjunction with the Federal Government. Essentially
                            this statement would say: 1) that the Soviet Government has knowingly
                            created a situation which could lead to a breach of the peace; 2) that
                            the so-called “peace treaty” <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0283"
                            />has no international validity; 3) that it cannot affect in any way
                            whatsoever the obligations of the USSR under agreements and arrangements
                            on the subject of Germany, including Berlin, previously concluded
                            between France, the UK, the US and the USSR; 4) that the three Western
                            Powers are prepared to defend their interests with respect to Germany
                            and to fulfill their obligation to maintain the freedom and security of
                            Berlin; 5) that they are, nevertheless, prepared at any time to resume
                            negotiations with the Soviets looking toward a just and reasonable
                            settlement of the questions of Germany and European security; and 6)
                            that they hope that, in view of the danger implicit in its course, the
                            Soviet Government will recognize the wisdom and importance of resuming
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>If the second stage campaign has been successful, and few or no nations
                            outside the Sino-Soviet bloc have signed the treaty, this fact would be
                            capitalized on to minimize further the significance of the treaty and
                            even to ridicule the Soviet diplomatic effort.</p>
                        <p>It may be advisable for the Western Governments to point out publicly
                            that the coming into force of the treaty will not give rise to any
                            untoward results so long as the Soviets and East Germans do not take
                            unilateral actions injurious to Western interests such as altering
                            present access procedures, or attempting to interfere with the presence
                            of Allied troops in West Berlin, or with its other links to the West.
                            The announcements should be coordinated with any steps toward Solution
                            C, which, under the circumstances, might be pertinent.</p>
                        <p>The position taken by the Three Powers should be endorsed by all the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Governments.</p>
                        <p>An additional legal and historical background paper has been prepared for

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Possible Military Measures</hi></p>
                        <p>No specific decision has yet been made as to whether military measures
                            should be taken in connection with the peace treaty. Nothing in the
                            current planning would preclude the undertaking of military measures,
                            including a further buildup, in an attempt to affect the terms of the
                            treaty or its subsequent implementation, but this would require a subtle
                            campaign to avoid the impression that the purpose was to prevent the
                            calling of a conference or the conclusion of a treaty, over which the
                            West can exercise no control. A real problem in such a course would be
                            whether these measures—particularly a buildup—could be sustained over,
                            and whether they would be effective against, the long period of very
                            cautious, piecemeal treaty implementation that may ensue. However, the
                            possibility of influencing by military measures the content of the
                            treaty and its implementation is certainly worth examining. The <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> is currently studying the question of
                            possible military measures <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0284"
                            />taking into account the level of the present buildup. A decision
                            concerning the desirability of a buildup will be difficult to take in
                            advance, because it will have to be governed somewhat by the state of
                            the discussions with the Soviets at the time and by the indications of
                            whether diplomatic moves have some prospect of influencing the Soviets,
                            or whether they are determined to go ahead in an uninhibited way. Once
                            the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> has completed its studies, a
                            basis will exist for taking appropriate US decisions in the light of the
                            estimated need when it has been concluded that the Soviets plan to
                            proceed with their treaty.</p>

                        <p>In the review, therefore, of Allied contingency planning for a separate

                                    Western efforts should be directed toward minimizing the

                        <p>The Secretary stated that he would like to report briefly on his

                                >Dobrynin</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d92fn2">A short memorandum

                                    >Dobrynin</persName> on August 8 is in Department of State,
                                Central Files, 762.00/8–862.</note> He said he could <pb n="263"
                                xml:id="pg_263" facs="0285"/>report briefly because no perceptible
                            business was transacted. Apparently Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> had no fresh instructions on any subject that
                            came up and the conversation did not advance any of the issues
                            discussed. The Secretary said he had mentioned three subjects:</p>
                        <p>[Here follow sections on a nuclear test ban treaty and non-diffusion of
                            nuclear weapons.]</p>
                        <p>3. Deputy Foreign Ministers’ Forum. The Secretary recalled that the
                            question of a Deputy Foreign Ministers’ forum had been raised with
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> as early as the
                            previous spring. The Secretary had asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> whether he had instructions from <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on the question of
                            establishment of a Deputy Foreign Ministers’ forum for discussion of
                            matters relating to Germany and Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> had said at Geneva that he would have word for
                            us as to whether the subject would be dealt with in this way. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that he would mention
                            this question to Moscow but observed that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> were on vacation now.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the question of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            delegation had come up and that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> had said nothing about <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s coming. He had said the
                            Soviet delegation was usually decided upon around the first of September
                            and had predicted that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            would probably be there.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary invited comments or questions. Lord <persName
                                corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> said it was a rather depressing
                            story.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed. He had asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> whether it would be safe for him to take a
                            vacation in August, but <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            had not been responsive.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LG3">von Lilienfeld</persName> asked what
                            impression the Secretary had as to the next move.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he thought that exploratory talks and probes have
                            about run their course. For some time both he and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had been repeating themselves.
                            The Secretary stated he had been as long winded and repetitious as the
                            Soviets. He said that unless they have something new to offer he does
                            not see much coming out of the bilaterals. He felt that they might seek
                            a different forum or might have something to say to some other member of
                            the Western group. He recalled that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> at Geneva had indicated that he was glad to
                            pursue bilateral talks but had referred to talks with the Western Four
                            as “better still”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled that he had emphasized to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that we could not accept
                            charges that we have delayed. If we had delayed a year and a half in
                            agreeing with them, they have likewise delayed that long in agreeing
                            with us. He had told Dobrynin, however, that we can always rush to a
                            crisis, while a resolution of differences must necessarily proceed more
                            slowly. <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0286"/>As to what the Russians
                            are going to do, the Secretary said they seek to leave the impression
                            with us that something is going to happen. We are not inclined to think
                            they will announce the signing of a peace treaty with East Germany
                            overnight. They will probably take some action with other governments of
                            calling a conference first. Next Monday will be the anniversary of the
                            wall and the Soviets might be inclined to celebrate it with harassment
                            or a new move. The Secretary said he did not know what they will do and
                            was by no means certain they had themselves decided. He mentioned it was
                            about time for another Soviet space spectacular.</p>
                        <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> said they probably have
                            not decided what to do but that one idea in their minds is probably to
                            sign a peace treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled that he had not had reactions from all of the
                            Western Four on whether if the Soviets called a conference we should
                            propose a meeting of Foreign Ministers or Deputy Foreign Ministers in
                            response.</p>
                        <p>As to the coming debate in the United Nations General Assembly, the
                            Secretary thought the introduction of specific substantive questions
                            could lead to confusion. He thought, however, we would find wide support
                            for the idea of talking instead of shooting—for the idea that neither
                            side should take any action which would aggravate tensions. He thought,
                            however, that a number of solutions on the question of troops or of
                            access would look easier to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            membership than to those of us who bear primary responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> said he had received
                            comments from his government on a number of papers, but not on this
                            specific proposal regarding Western responses to a Soviet call for a
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LG3">von Lilienfeld</persName> said that he had
                            received and transmitted to us comments on the conference question but
                            not on the related papers. He commented that we should do something to
                            regain the initiative of action on our side.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he did not know how much we could rely on Soviet
                            advance planning, but that they wanted to send their Minister of
                            Agriculture in September. He said if we were expecting to precipitate a
                            crisis with another state, we would certainly not be sending one of our
                            cabinet members to visit the state at the time.</p>
                        <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> asked whether we thought
                            the Soviets, if they decided to go ahead with a peace treaty, might not
                            want to minimize the awkward consequence by compensating gestures. They
                            might well be interested in a meeting of Deputy Foreign Ministers and
                            propose that we seek to agree on how to handle our disagreements.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that this might be a rational reaction, but if
                            the Soviets were not pressing matters to a crisis it seems they would
                                <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0287"/>have desired to pick up
                            various opportunities which have been before them to avoid a crisis. In
                            recent months they have increased their public commitment to action on
                            Berlin, and have increased for themselves the prestige problem involved
                            in not doing anything.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LG3">von Lilienfeld</persName> commented that
                            they had in several ways, however, seemed to accept the idea that the
                            West would still be in Berlin in the future.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LC4">Lebel</persName> asked whether they would
                            be likely to precede a move in Berlin with a move in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he would feel more relaxed if he thought
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> action would necessarily be their
                            first move.</p>
                        <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> raised the question
                            whether they could get the United Nations to approve the idea of a peace
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we will be in a powerful position in the United
                            Nations if we say to the Assembly in effect, “Ask the Berliners and ask
                            the East Germans what they want to do”. This fact may give the Soviets
                            some pause in deciding what to do in the United Nations. He asked if
                            anyone had any doubts as to what the sentiments of the Berlin people
                            would be.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LG3">von Lilienfeld</persName> recalled they
                            had made their views clear in every case where they had had an
                            opportunity to do so. He added that there had been indications that the
                            Soviet test series might be concluded by October and this might have a
                            bearing upon <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            attendance and Soviet strategy at the Assembly.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there are enough hints and noises around to indicate
                            that the anniversary of the wall may take on some significance to the
                            Soviets. We do not, however, expect a move of the kind that would
                            precipitate a military crisis.</p>
                        <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> commented there may be
                            harassments.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName>
                            recalled that our mission in Berlin had sent a message indicating the
                            possibility of harassments at Friedrichstrasse and possibly a move to
                            cut off access to East Berlin.<note n="3" xml:id="d92fn3">Telegram 160

                                >Hillenbrand</persName> said we have contingency plans for this

                        <p>The Secretary commented that we could well have some move of that
                            sort.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LG3">von Lilienfeld</persName> asked if there
                            had been any shift in emphasis by the Soviets from the question of the
                            presence of Western troops to the question of sovereignty of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said not really. If this were the Soviet intention they had
                            overlooked opportunities to make it clear. The Secretary recalled <pb
                                n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0288"/>that the only stiff talk by the
                            Russians to him was on the first day of his recent Geneva meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had read from a paper on that
                            occasion and the rest of the several days of conversations appeared to
                            be an effort to soften the impact of the prepared statement. Even as
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was reading it, he
                            pointed out that the statement did not take into account things which he
                            had already said that same day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName>, in response to
                            the Secretary’s question, said he considered the difference between
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement on the
                            first day and on subsequent days to be more a difference of tone than of
                            substance.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled that when he had rejected <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s threat, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had not come back and redoubled
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated he supposed that all intelligence services were
                            alerted with their antenna out to sense any indications of a new Soviet
                            move. Our intelligence service had been alerted.</p>
                        <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> asked what was next as
                            regards the exchanges with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that they owe us comments on two propositions, namely,
                            the proposal regarding a Deputy Foreign Ministers’ forum and the matter
                            of non-dissemination involved in the Irish Resolution. He did not expect
                            that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> would be giving us
                            further comments on the test ban question in the near future.</p>

                            <item>The briefing you tried to arrange in August 1961 finally came off
                                a year later. The intervening period has been used both to widen the
                                areas of agreement and to sharpen those of disagreement among the
                                Allies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJC1">Ausland</persName>’s

                                    corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> observed that the Allies
                                still could not agree on what sort of mobilization was needed in
                                Phase II (non-combatant actions after significant blockage of
                                access) and that this agreement was not likely to be achieved until
                                consensus had been reached on what military measures to take (e.g.,
                                when to use tactical nuclears) in Phases III and IV. The President
                                asked what the difficulties were in reaching agreement with our
                                Allies. In the ensuing discussion, the following points were made: <list>

                                        acknowledged our European Allies wanted to use nuclear
                                        weapons earlier in the military operations than did we. In
                                        response to the President’s question as to whether the
                                        Allies chose this course in order to eliminate the need for

                                        said he thought the European arguments were wrong for three
                                        reasons: they overestimated the strength of the USSR; they
                                        imply that their salvation rested on the early use of
                                        tactical nuclear weapons without understanding the effects
                                        of these weapons; and finally, they afforded the Allies an
                                        excuse not to build up the conventional forces they had
                                        agreed to in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>

                                    <item>The President wondered how much real difference there was
                                        in our positions, since we were only asking our Allies to
                                        build their forces to 30 divisions, and the planning for
                                        these goals rested on an assumption of early use of tactical
                                        nuclear weapons. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                            >McNamara</persName> replied that analysis last summer
                                        had shown that with 30 divisions we could hold a
                                        considerable period of time—not months, but at least some
                                        weeks.</item>

                                    <item>As an aside, the President asked whether we had asked the
                                        Germans to build their conventional forces to 750,000 men as
                                        reported in the New York Times this morning. The Times
                                        article sounded so authentic and precise that the President
                                        questioned if it had been backgrounded. It had not been.
                                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                                        pointed out that the story was wrong on two counts: we had
                                        indeed asked the Germans to increase their forces, but not
                                        by any definite number, and the Germans had not refused.
                                        Furthermore, Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1"
                                            >Strauss</persName> had requested Secretary <persName
                                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to ask him to
                                        build up Germany’s conventional forces. Mr. <persName
                                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> did so, and
                                        that’s how our request came about.</item>

                                            >Adenauer</persName> didn’t stand up and support US
                                        positions before <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                            Gaulle</persName>. The answer was that the Germans are
                                        sure of our support, but are not as sure of the French;
                                        therefore they defer more to French whims. But they do not
                                        always give in. The President said that perhaps we spent too
                                        much time reassuring our Allies. Ambassador <persName
                                            corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> commented that the
                                        time will soon come when indeed we should ask the Germans if
                                        their protests are serious and to let them know that we are
                                        becoming concerned about their motives in all this
                                        discussion.</item>

                            <item>The second interruption occurred when the President asked whether
                                there is as much disagreement between the US and our Allies on the
                                use of tactical nuclear weapons as there seems to be. He would agree
                                with the Europeans that if the Russians started a mass attack
                                against Europe, we almost would be forced to use nuclear weapons
                                against the first Russian who came across the line. Therefore, our
                                disagreements seemed to be exaggerated. We seem to be involved in a
                                theoretical argument with our Allies; and no one ever gives on
                                these. He questioned if we couldn’t find some way around the
                                impasse, say by telling our Allies that we would agree to the early
                                use of tactical nuclear weapons if they would build up 30 divisions.
                                We could do this, since the 30 division figure assumed the early use
                                of nuclear weapons. Such an approach would put the pressure on them.
                                The following points were then made: <list>

                                        said if weapons agreed to the early use of nuclear weapons,
                                        our Allies would say this obviated the necessity for going
                                        to 30 divisions, just as Kissinger’s article had done in the
                                        July issue of Foreign Affairs. (Kissinger actually said that
                                        more than 30 divisions would be needed to implement
                                        successfully a strategy employing tactical nuclear
                                        weapons.)</item>

                                        use of nuclear weapons and to reach this decision would
                                        require time and some conventional defensive efforts.</item>

                                    <item>The President said that if there were no Berlin situation,
                                        he would be inclined to agree with the Allies on the use of
                                        tactical nuclear weapons. It is the Berlin situation in

                                        they believed that nuclear strategy offered the best hope of
                                        insuring deterrence, and also they did not want to spend the

                                    <item>The President asked how our planning stood to meet a
                                        Russian action for signing a <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                            >GDR</gloss> peace treaty over some weekend. The answer
                                        was we have fairly good plans, but that this is considered
                                        an unlikely event. The Russians will want to exploit the
                                        signing of the peace treaty and perhaps call some sort of
                                        peace conference. Thus, although the signing of a peace
                                        treaty may occur, it is unlikely to occur suddenly.</item>

                                        During the interim he would talk to Senator Russell and
                                        Congressman Vinson to let them know that the Administration
                                        would probably ask for authority to call up 50,000 to
                                        100,000 men if needed. During this brief discussion,
                                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                                        gave one of his numerical recitations of what we had called
                                        up last year and how we stood at the present time. It was
                                        impressive for his knowledge of details, if not for its
                                        overall impact.</item>

                        <p>The Ambassador opened the conversation by stating that he had been
                            instructed to convey to the Secretary the considered views of his
                            government on the Secretary’s proposal that there be a Deputy Foreign
                            Ministers Conference to discuss the Berlin problem. Although he
                            frequently referred to a Russian language text, he stipulated that the
                            approach was “oral” in nature. He outlined the following position.</p>
                        <p>As the Secretary already is aware, the Soviet Government is prepared, as
                            previously, to explore with the other interested governments all
                            possibilities for settling the problems of West Berlin and Germany.
                            However, the Soviet Government cannot agree to the proposal for a Deputy
                            Foreign Ministers Conference since it would give the appearance of
                            negotiations which, in fact, would have no real chance of success. In
                            fact, there has been no progress on resolving the key issue of
                            withdrawing Western forces from West Berlin and terminating the
                            occupation regime there; a Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference is likely
                            to delay settlement. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName> himself at Geneva had commented to Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that he could not
                            envisage what a Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference would discuss. The
                            desirability of ending the international arms race and easing tensions
                            among states demands “drawing a line under World War II” and liquidating
                            the occupation regime in West Berlin. For its part, the Soviet
                            Government has earnestly sought to resolve the problem of West Berlin.
                            Premier <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> himself has
                            made a number of compromise proposals: e.g., the recent one that certain
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces be introduced into West
                            Berlin. Unfortunately, the U.S. Government has shown no real interest in
                            settling the West Berlin problem. The Soviet Government feels that “the
                            American position” would put the Soviet Government in a position of
                            settling the West Berlin problem in the absence of “our allies” who
                            participated in World <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0293"/>War II
                            against Nazi Germany. This faces the USSR with the necessity to sign a
                            peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The Soviet
                            Government feels it cannot remain inactive on the West Berlin problem
                            because those who oppose an improvement in the international climate
                            have been taking advantage of the absence of an agreement, as witness
                            recent developments in West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that, first, he would like to correct an apparent
                            misunderstanding. When discussing the possibility of a Deputy Foreign
                            Ministers Conference in Geneva with Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, he did not state that he did
                            not know what such a Conference would discuss. On the contrary, he had
                            discussed this subject with specific reference to the statement of
                            General Principles previously given to the Foreign Minister and had
                            pointed out to the Foreign Minister that the General Principles
                            indicated the line along which the U.S. thought Conference discussion
                            might go. However, Soviet views thereon were desired and requested. The
                            Secretary then expressed a hope that the Soviet Government will give
                            further thought to steps which the four Commandants in Berlin might take
                            to alleviate local tension. In this context, the Secretary alluded to
                            recent press reports of incidents along the Berlin wall occasioned by
                            strong emotions accompanying the anniversary of the building of the
                            wall. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            commented that the views of his Government on the situation in West
                            Berlin along the wall were conveyed in his Government’s most recent
                                note<note n="1" xml:id="d94fn1">For text of the August 10 Soviet

                            reports of subsequent developments.</p>
                        <p>After referring briefly in a commendatory vein to the progress of the
                            Soviet Union’s two men in space, the Secretary reverted to the subject
                            of Berlin and said that he regretted the Soviet government had not
                            reacted favorably to the proposal for a Deputy Foreign Ministers
                            Conference. The proposal was not intended to be a means to delay
                            agreement but was advanced in a sincere belief that, if acted upon, it
                            would constitute a positive step. He assured the Ambassador that the
                            Soviet Government’s views, as conveyed by the Ambassador, would be given
                            careful study.</p>

                        <p>Message from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAR2">Day</persName>:</p>
                        <p>“Following the shooting of the refugee on Friday,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d95fn1">On August 17 PETER FECHTER had been shot while
                                trying to escape from East Berlin. He bled to death within sight of
                                Checkpoint Charlie. On August 21 the President sent a memorandum to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asking for an account

                                >General Watson</persName> considered that we should keep the
                            initiative with the Soviets and keep the pressure on them which resulted
                            from this incident. Meanwhile, the action of the West Berlin crowds
                            against Soviet busses near Friedrichstrasse<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2"
                                >In response to the shooting, crowds in West Berlin on August 18,
                                19, and 20 stoned buses carrying guards to the Soviet war memorial
                                in West Berlin.</note> led us to believe that sooner or later the
                            Soviets would react in some way to this situation.</p>
                        <p>We therefore decided that <persName corresp="#p_WMGAII1">General
                                Watson</persName> should invite the Acting Soviet Commandant to a
                            Four Power Commandants Meeting to discuss means of reducing tension in
                            the city. We decided that <persName corresp="#p_WMGAII1">General
                                Watson</persName> should inform the Soviet Acting Commandant that he
                            was lifting the ban on the entry of the Soviet Commandant and his
                            Political Advisor into West Berlin for the purpose of conducting this
                            and subsequent meetings.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, at about 1800 hours today another Soviet bus was attacked by a
                            crowd about one block from Friedrichstrasse and about 19 windows in the
                            bus were broken by stones before the bus could proceed. About 1900, the
                            Deputy Soviet Commandant requested a meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_WMGAII1">General Watson</persName> and also with the
                            British Commandant, which we assume is related to the incident of an
                            hour earlier.</p>
                        <p>We considered that it was highly desirable to move ahead with the
                            initiative we had earlier determined on in order to keep the discussions
                            with the Soviets concerned with the basic issues of tension along the
                            Wall and not to narrow it to the bus incidents. We therefore met
                            urgently with the UK and French and agreed that <persName
                                corresp="#p_WMGAII1">Watson</persName> should send a letter tonight
                            along the line of that which I described earlier proposing a Four Power
                            Commandants meeting for tomorrow afternoon.</p>
                        <p>We asked the Soviet Deputy Commandant to call on <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCEJ1">Hulick</persName>, Acting Deputy Commandant, at
                            2300 at which time we intended to deliver the letter to him. He did not
                            appear, however, and we have now taken steps to deliver the letter to
                            Soviet Headquarters.</p>
                        <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0295"/>
                        <p>We intend to meet with the British and French tomorrow morning to discuss
                            with them the line of action to take with the Soviets should they accept
                            this invitation.</p>
                        <p>I should tell you that the atmosphere in Berlin right now has a
                            considerable anti-American overtone as a result of the shooting on
                            Friday and our inability to aid the wounded refugee. The crowd which
                            formed during the day along the border attacked by jeers and slogans the
                            Americans as well as the Soviets. Within the past hour we had a small
                            demonstration outside the Mission gates in which autos passed back and
                            forth blowing their horns in protest. I don’t want to exaggerate this
                            sentiment, but it does exist and it is difficult to say right now
                            whether it will die away or increase.</p>
                        <p>We would be interested in any comment you may have with regard to the
                            course of action we have taken.</p>
                        <p>Cash: I think it is logical and reasonable. I see no problem as far as we
                            are concerned. I will discuss it with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2"
                                >Tyler</persName> and if we have any further word, will call you on
                            the KY–9.</p>
                        <p>Day: We would be interested in any guidance you would have on what we
                            should discuss with the Soviets, but unless you have something else,
                            don’t call. We are sending a telegram with the text of the letter to the
                            Acting Soviet Commandant. <persName corresp="#p_HCEJ1">Hulick</persName>
                            advises that we have been informed there is no one at the Soviet
                            Headquarters tonight to receive the letter, but our messenger will go
                            anyway and try to leave it.”<note n="3" xml:id="d95fn3">Following this
                                conversation, the letter was delivered at 2:15 a.m. on August 20 to
                                Soviet Headquarters in East Berlin. Seven hours later it was
                                returned. It was released to the press that morning. (Telegrams 214

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAR2">Day</persName> also advised that at 2130
                            the Soviet Deputy Commandant called at both US and UK Headquarters. He
                            was told <persName corresp="#p_WMGAII1">General Watson</persName> was
                            not available, but would be writing the Soviet Commandant. At the
                            British Headquarters, he spoke with the “Military attache” (an aide to
                            the UK Commandant) and simply asked that the Soviet bus at the War
                            Memorial be permitted to return to East Berlin without the special
                            British military and West Berlin police guards which had been
                            arranged.</p>

                            problem of possible use US forces to control crowds if West Berlin
                            police prove inadequate. I agree maximum use should be made of West
                            Berlin police but in final analysis Three Powers are responsible in West
                            Berlin. West Berliners cannot have it both ways—they cannot have our
                            protection on basis occupation rights and on other hand ignore our
                            directives. You should not therefore shrink from use US forces if this
                            becomes necessary to maintain law and order.</p>

                        <p>PRS 2078. 1. Although escapees have been shot, injured and killed before,
                            the particular characteristics of Friday’s incident have understandably
                            caused a reaction not only in Berlin, but throughout the world. We must
                            accept the fact that a solution to this problem, or at least some action
                            on our part, is of a higher order of urgency than heretofore. The
                            so-called “mobs” in West Berlin are a factor to be considered, but we
                            cannot let mobs dictate actions in a time of such sensitivity and on a
                            matter of such importance.</p>
                        <p>2. Circumstances make it necessary that we be prepared to deal with a
                            recurrence of this type of incident, unlikely as an exact repetition <pb
                                n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0297"/>may be, but our preparations
                            must not in themselves raise the level of danger. I feel, therefore,
                            that something along the following lines should be considered.</p>

                            <item>We should make it known publicly that we consider Friday’s
                                incident as having gone beyond the limits of the local military and
                                political situation in Berlin and having constituted an offense
                                against humanity without regard to political boundaries. We must
                                make it clear that, while the responsibility of rendering medical
                                aid in East Berlin is clearly that of the Soviet Union or its East
                                German satellite, failure on the part of the appropriate authorities
                                to take prompt and effective action in a case of this kind will
                                compel Western Allies to do so.</item>

                                actually on the spot, of our intention to render such aid. This

                                if necessary. Troops, tanks, or other military equipment which may
                                be needed, should be positioned to give the support required, but
                                the conduct of our personnel and the location of weapons should not
                                be such as to constitute unnecessarily a challenge, a dare, to the

                                >Watson</persName> I have learned that an ambulance will be

                            being specific, may be far more effective and would not risk the mere
                            presence of an ambulance suggesting the limits of our action in case of
                            another incident, or serving as an invitation to escapees, or as an

                        <p>530. Policy. Eyes only for the President and the Secretary. I called on
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> at my request late
                            yesterday. He had just come from long meeting with party leaders (which
                            in fact was still in session) and appeared despressed. After asking
                            about my home leave, he remarked “we have problems, don’t we?”, and
                            fetched from his desk telegram he had just received from Paris saying
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was calling special
                            Cabinet session this week to consider political and military questions
                            relating to European unity. He implied he was concerned about what
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> might have in mind,
                            saying that nothing could be done without America. I replied I thought
                            America was still present. “But is it”, he countered. I said perhaps
                            that was what I wanted to talk to him about.</p>
                        <p>I then recounted for Chancellor concern regarding his attitude which I
                            had found in Washington—concern which I shared and was at loss to
                            account for—and gave him the President’s letter,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d98fn1">In his letter, dated August 16, the President
                                thanked <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> for his
                                sympathetic attitude on the question of U.S. poultry exports to
                                Germany, explained the rationale for recent U.S. military
                                assignments, and reiterated U.S. determination to maintain adequate
                                levels of nuclear weapons in Europe. (Ibid., Presidential
                                Correspondence: Lot 66 D 204)</note> together with German
                            translation which I had prepared for him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> read translation eagerly,
                            and was amused re reference to poultry, saying “Senator Fulbright
                            certainly keeps after the President and me, doesn’t he?”As he read
                            further, his face brightened perceptibly, and at end he exclaimed, “This
                            is a wonderful letter. It is just what I wanted from the President. I am
                            so glad.” He then asked me if he might interrupt conversation to
                            telephone <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Brentano</persName>, who was still
                            at party meeting, saying he assumed it would be all right to say he had
                            had word from the President. I assured him that it was.</p>
                        <p>When <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> returned to room, I
                            referred to his fears, expressed in previous conversations, re influence
                            on US opinion towards Germany of Shirer book,<note n="2" xml:id="d98fn2"
                                >William L. Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, New York,
                                1960.</note> etc., and said as result of my stay at home I could
                            reassure him on this score. I went on to say, however, there was a
                            development which was disturbing, and that was spate of reports out of
                            Germany about his lack of confidence in US policy and of German doubts
                            and suspicions generally, which was beginning to find counter-reaction
                            re German attitudes both in Washington and in American opinion
                            generally. I referred to the President’s conviction re necessity for
                            preservation <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0299"/>of unity in face
                            of test on Berlin which we may face in coming months, and said this was
                            mutual task. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> agreed, but
                            said recent stories I referred to had all come from American
                            correspondents in Europe and Washington. I said this was not wholly
                            correct, to which Chancellor rejoined by asking with innocent air what I
                            thought could be done. I replied, equally straightfaced, that I thought
                            best solution was to confine discussion of any divergence in views to
                            official channels. He agreed, and commented that he had recently had
                            very good talks with <persName>Eisenhower</persName> and <persName

                                no record of the meeting with Eisenhower, who visited Germany at the

                            heartened him—although at same time he implied that what he had been
                            waiting for was word from the President himself.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> then admitted that he had
                            been disturbed by European interpretations of <persName

                            for most doubtful of Europeans. I then argued again that voicing doubts
                            re American policies to journalists, rather than official exchanges,
                            could only result in eventual erosion of unity which he clearly

                            He added he would reply to the President shortly.<note n="7"

                        <p>As I was leaving, <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> referred
                            to the situation in Berlin, saying that hindsight showed both Western
                            forces and West Berlin police should have made effort to aid refugee who
                            was left to die on Eastern side of wall last week, and he urged that we
                            take measures to meet any future situation of this kind. I replied that
                            Western Commandants had been meeting during afternoon to determine what
                            might be done in future, and I was hopeful we might find positive
                            measures to recommend to our governments. “Do it soon”, he said; “and
                            let the West Berliners know”, saying we must appreciate the emotional
                            strain which the populace was under.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary opened by commenting that he wanted to say a few words
                            about the present situation in Berlin. He said he felt it was very
                            important that the Soviet and Western Commandants get together to deal
                            with the problem of tensions in the city. He said it was necessary to go
                            back to the building of the wall, itself, to find the major cause for
                            the sense of deep dismay and anger felt by both West and East Berliners.
                            The separation of families and the splitting of the life of the city had
                            made a deep impact. It was inevitable that the wall would contribute to
                            tensions in Berlin. Following the building of the wall there had been a
                            number of incidents mostly the result of East Berliners trying to get to
                            West Berlin. There had been shootings, violence, and bullets flying into
                            West Berlin endangering lives, all of which had created a sense of
                            dismay and outrage. Last Friday when the East Berlin police shot an 18
                            year old boy and left him lying for one hour with no assistance, a wave
                            of revulsion and horror had gone around the world. It is hard to
                            understand how anyone could be so callous, and we cannot believe that
                            this represents the policy or the attitude of the Soviet Government. On
                            more than one occasion we have urged that the four Commandants should
                            meet to consult on the way to handle problems arising in Berlin. We
                            think such a meeting could improve the situation. Neither the Soviets
                            nor we want these problems put in the hands of the Germans on both sides
                            of the wall, leaving it to them to stir up a situation reaching beyond
                            Berlin with which the Great Powers, rather than the Germans, must deal.
                            During the last two days the Soviet Deputy Commandant has come without
                            appointment to ask to see <persName corresp="#p_WMGAII1">General
                                Watson</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_WMGAII1">General
                                Watson</persName> has asked the Acting Soviet Commandant to meet to
                            consult on recent <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0301"/>events. We
                            will take the necessary steps to maintain law and order in West Berlin,
                            but this can be difficult in a city of 2–1/4 million people. The
                            demonstrations since the incident on Friday have created problems, but
                            these are matters where quadripartite cooperation is required because
                            one thing leads to another. The US, French, and British Commandants have
                            urged a meeting with the Soviet Commandant to reduce tensions and ensure
                            law and order. The Secretary said he would urge once again that this
                            matter be reconsidered so that the Soviet Commandant could meet with his
                            Western counterparts. He hoped very much that the Ambassador would send
                            the President’s and his genuine urging that the Commandants get together
                            to handle these problems in a peaceful fashion.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the only
                            information he had was from the Western press, but it seemed that there
                            had been stoning of Soviet soldiers and buses. This is really a matter
                            of great concern. He would report what the Secretary had said.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that there was a direct connection between the killing
                            of the 18 year old boy on Friday and the stones thrown at both Soviet
                            and American soldiers. He noted that for a time the Soviets had refused
                            an escort for their buses.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said there was
                            no change in the position of the Soviet Government, but he would report
                            what the Secretary said.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished to underline the importance of the Soviet
                            Government’s permitting the East German regime to carry out incidents
                            which caused tension. He said one could not logically create tension in
                            Berlin and then complain that the city was a source of tension.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the
                            Secretary knew the Soviet arguments, and there was no need to repeat
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> agreed that they would say to the press that
                            they had had an exchange of views on the current situation in
                                Berlin.<note n="1" xml:id="d99fn1">For text of this statement, see

                        <p>The Soviet action in liquidating the office of the Commandant in East
                            Berlin is long step in direction in which they have been moving for some
                                time.<note n="2" xml:id="d100fn2">For text of the August 22 Soviet
                                statement abolishing the post of Soviet Commandant in Berlin, <hi

                                    1962</hi>, pp. 714–715. In response, on August 24, the United
                                States, the United Kingdom, and France stated that the abolition
                                would “have no effect whatsoever on either Allied rights or Soviet
                                responsibilities in Berlin.” For text of the tripartite statement,
                                see ibid., pp. 715–716.</note> Timing may have been influenced by
                            increased pressure being brought to bear by Allies for Commandants to
                            meet and by strong reaction in West against <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> activities along wall for which Allies were holding
                            Soviets responsible. However, move of this sort had very likely been
                            planned for some time for relatively early execution. To Soviets it must
                            have seemed highly desirable to eliminate once and for all their special
                            responsibilities for East Berlin as distinct from Soviet Zone. By their
                            act they have formally lopped off East Berlin from greater Berlin and
                            have left Western sectors in effect as 3-power managed city in midst of
                            East Germany with specific Soviet presence and quadripartite as well as
                            unilateral functions remaining in it (quadripartite—<gloss
                                target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss>, Spandau; unilateral—war
                            memorial).</p>
                        <p>Operationally, we shall be confronted very likely by Soviet efforts
                            reduce role of Allied Commandants to level of Soviet troop commander.
                            Immediate practical effects on our operations however will not
                            necessarily be great. (This is not to say there will not be such
                            effects—witness threat of Autobahn trouble on August 24.) While this is
                            so, psychological and long-term importance of this formal Soviet step
                            should not be underestimated. With passage of time, perhaps even matter
                            of months, image of Berlin in eyes of world and even of Berliners
                            themselves will likely be considerably affected. In absence effective
                            counteraction on our part, connection of Allied presence in West Berlin
                            to its origins in 4-power post war occupation control will become vaguer
                            and vaguer until it may be lost entirely at which time Allies will
                            appear simply to be <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0303"/>managers of
                            entity known as West Berlin and located in midst of <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Within West Berlin there is danger
                            that if Commandants lose substance of their role which gives them right
                            and power to control the city, Berliners will be less and less willing
                            to accept such control. There has been evidence of this already in
                            recent past.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile Soviets can be expected to attempt to graft Allied Berlin
                            presence onto <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, having cut it away
                            from 4-power principle. When they consider this graft psychologically
                            complete, by which time Allied access to East Berlin would presumably
                            have ceased, they will if their past tactics are any indication take the
                            further concrete steps which logically follow from it. Among latter
                            would be further pressure to secure international acceptance of West
                            Berlin as free city, recognized 4-power presence in West Berlin,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>While this is bleak enough picture, it is of course nothing really new.
                            We had not foreseen maneuver in this particular form on part of Soviets
                            but had been aware that their efforts being directed along lines
                            described above. Soviet move accelerates certain trends and brings more
                            clearly into focus problems which face us here. Effective steps can be
                            devised to meet continuous Soviet challenge. As this challenge becomes
                            more basic in its nature, however, and latest development is quite basic
                            in its attack on our position, our responses must be weighed with
                            particular care.</p>

                            <item>I personally cannot help thinking of the way we used the selfsame
                                “vital interest” logic a year ago to justify our acceptance of The
                                Wall, only to wring our hands a few months later for not having
                                reacted more vigorously. My idea of a logical approach to this
                                problem is to try to deduce the Soviet motive for executing this
                                latest move, because it surely wasn’t pointless. As I see it, there
                                are three major possible motives, either singly or in combination: <list>

                                soldiers standing in them. Although the soldiers sat down when
                                asked, they stood up again on the way to the Soviet war memorial in
                                West Berlin and on the return trip. (Ibid., Central Files,

                            that he had no information beyond what he has seen in the American
                            press. The Secretary continued <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0306"
                            />that he could understand Soviet concern as regards the problem created
                            by stones but we are concerned by the fact that recent reports indicate
                            that armed Soviet men are riding outside armored vehicles. This practice
                            would seem to destroy the logic of using the armed vehicles for crossing
                            into West Berlin. We for our part are trying to avoid incidents, the
                            chances of which would seem to be increased by positioning armed men
                            outside the vehicles. The Ambassador interjected quickly that the Soviet
                            soldiers are not brandishing arms. The Secretary went on to say, as a
                            point of information, that we in fact escort our own armored vehicles
                            when they are passing through the streets of West Berlin. He would hope
                            that this matter can be worked out quickly on the spot. The Ambassador
                            commented that these matters essentially are details and can be worked
                            out by the proper persons. The Secretary added that we have noticed that
                            details have a habit of growing into matters of concern and should be
                            taken care of at the outset. He added that “we” (i.e., the Secretary and
                            the Ambassador) should not have to talk about such things as the passage
                            of a few vehicles.</p>

                        <p>The Berlin crisis has warmed up a lot in recent weeks and looks as if it
                            is getting worse. The Soviet Government has not stated any new deadline,
                            but has indicated on every channel its continued belief that the only
                            way of making progress is for the Western occupation forces, in one way
                            or another, to get out of West Berlin. We have of course said that this
                            is impossible. This has been said in conversations between <persName

                        <p>We have no hard intelligence estimate of Soviet intentions about a peace
                            treaty, but yesterday’s abolition of the Soviet Commandant’s office
                            looks like the first in a series of steps aimed at changing their
                            official position on Berlin still further. The most notable phenomenon
                            to me in recent weeks has been the constant increase in Soviet noises
                            and the lack of any correspondingly angry public statement on our side.
                            This owes much to the President’s own temper, and much also to the fact
                            that the Soviets have been crying wolf since 1958.</p>
                        <p>In my own judgment, the most useful thing you can do with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> if he brings up Berlin—and
                            perhaps even if he does not—is to say as clearly and emphatically as you
                            can that it would be a most dangerous business to confuse our calmness
                            and good manners with any weakening of determination whatsoever. Any
                            move against our vital interests in Berlin will be met by appropriate,
                            prompt, and energetic responses, and no one can doubt the dangers which
                            such activity would imply for all concerned. Moreover, if the Soviet
                            Government insists upon forcing the issue in terms of propaganda and
                            public opinion, we shall have no alternative but to make clear just who
                            it is that is disturbing the peace in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>You should of course say none of this in tones of threat, but rather in
                            the interest of clarity of communication. The importance of your saying
                            it is precisely that you are not <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy

                                    <p>Soviets have eliminated any unique aspects their presence in
                                        East Berlin, which now simply part of their presence in
                                        Soviet Zone generally. Only Soviet activities for which they
                                        will assume responsibility relating to special status of
                                        Berlin are now in West Berlin. This situation has two
                                        significant aspects: Soviet presence West Berlin is
                                        something Sovs will foster as contribution to thesis of
                                        4-power West Berlin; and it is also basis for Soviet claim
                                        for access rights to West Berlin. In latter respect Soviets
                                        can be expected argue that all four are now in same
                                        situation. War Memorial may become most important of symbols
                                        Soviet presence since it unilateral and thus can be
                                        presented as their “sector” in West Berlin giving them right
                                        of presence. Soviet presence in West Berlin would no longer
                                        be based, therefore, on previous right of circulation all
                                        four powers in 4-power city including East Berlin, but on
                                        principle of right of access to installations.</p>
                                    <p>Under these conditions we can expect long-term problem of our
                                        relations with Soviets to develop along two lines: first,
                                        issues re right of Soviet access to West Berlin; and

                                        Berliners with cumbersome tripartite machinery. In addition,
                                        events particularly in past year have brought some increase
                                        in uncertainty of West Berliners regarding our determination

                                        with Allied control likely to increase. This tendency should
                                        not be over-emphasized since West Berliners are aware their
                                        ultimate security lies with three Western governments.
                                        However, it can be expected that pressure by West Berlin

                            <item>Your memorandum concentrates mainly on the problem of East Berlin.
                                I think the truth is that East Berlin is not an issue of war and
                                peace for us, and therefore we should not adopt any of the more
                                drastic alternatives proposed in your memorandum. The time for a
                                fight over an effective Western role in East Berlin passed, if it
                                ever existed, many years ago—about the time of the first blockade.
                                Our contingency plans therefore do not call for shooting over
                                developments which may affect the relatively unimportant access we
                                now have to East Berlin.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The crucial question remains that of West Berlin, and our
                                attention is currently focused on what we should do to sustain the
                                vital interests which do indeed exist there, in the event of further
                                Soviet steps looking toward the increasingly complete incorporation
                                of East Berlin into East Germany. There may be important things
                                which we can do to strengthen our own ties to West Berlin, and
                                perhaps the ties of West Berlin to West Germany, in this event. The
                                three basic rights—of presence, access, and viability—which we have
                                been asserting throughout this Administration all relate to West
                                Berlin and not East Berlin; it is on this position that we shall
                                continue to base our planning.</item>

                            he would get <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName>’s reaction on
                            the problem to be discussed today.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then sketched our present situation. The Soviet Union is
                            pushing the Western Powers out of East Berlin, and at the same time
                            striving to make West Berlin a Four-Power city in which they have an
                            active role. We are now nearly at the end of the first process; the
                            second part is beginning to move forward more rapidly. The problem on
                            which we must shortly make a decision is thus whether we should not
                            begin to head off the Soviet efforts to increase their role in West
                            Berlin. The Secretary’s first inclination was toward such action, lest
                            there be serious <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0313"/>consequences
                            for the confidence and morale of the West Berlin population, which in
                            turn would react on our position in West Berlin. The immediate problem
                            in turn divides as follows: we might try: to increase our own presence
                            in East Berlin, decrease the Soviet presence in West Berlin, or both. He
                            is asking our Mission in Berlin and our Embassy in Bonn to supply us
                            with a complete catalog of Soviet activities in West Berlin. These now
                            go far beyond the activities related to <gloss target="#t_BASC1"
                                >BASC</gloss>, Spandau and the War Memorial, and include, for
                            instance, <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> offices and Polish and
                            Czech Military Missions. For the present, the Secretary believes that we
                            should keep to our plan of refusing to show identification of allied
                            military personnel to East Germans in East Berlin. If, as a consequence,
                            the Soviets refuse to permit entry of our military personnel into East
                            Berlin, then we should respond by closing West Berlin to the
                            Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether we should make this trade on the particular
                            point of showing identification. He also remarked that the War Memorial
                            may be a particularly sensitive point with the Soviets, and it might
                            well be an affront to them to be excluded from the War Memorial if we
                            admitted them to West Berlin at all.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> then presented Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName>’s argument. We have
                            nothing to lose in East Berlin; our present minimal activity is of
                            marginal significance. On the other hand, if we allow Soviet presence in
                            West Berlin to increase, we run a double risk. First, the show of Soviet
                            military power in West Berlin affects the West Berliners adversely in a
                            way which harms Berlin’s long-term viability. Second, we may, through
                            usage, create a situation in which it is easy for the Soviets to tie our
                            access to West Berlin from West Germany with their access to West Berlin
                            from East Berlin. The President again commented on the probable special
                            sensitivity of the War Memorial. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1"
                                >Nitze</persName> noted that the location of the Memorial was the
                            result of a deal between the British and the Russians. He went on to
                            suggest that while there may be no need to deny access to the War
                            Memorial, we could require them to come to it by the Brandenberg Gate,
                            which meant a journey of less than 100 yards in West Berlin. Further, we
                            could require that they come in buses and not <gloss target="#t_APC1"
                                >APC</gloss>’s. The President thought the alternative: use of <gloss
                                target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>’s and the Brandenberg Gate, or use of
                            buses and the Friederichstrasse Gate, a reasonable one to present to the
                            Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then directed the attention of the group to the draft
                            telegram for Berlin and the European capitals, inviting their comments
                            on the alternatives which the Secretary had stated (attached).<note

                                facs="0314"/>remarked that there was nothing to prevent the Soviets
                            from doing what was sketched in the first paragraph of the message;
                            namely, equate Soviet position in West Berlin with allied access to West
                            Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> pointed out the
                            importance of usage in this respect. Although there was nothing to
                            prevent them from making this identification now, our acquiescence in
                            the increasing Soviet presence in West Berlin would make such an
                            identification more natural.</p>
                        <p>The President again asked whether we should not continue to permit Soviet
                            access to the three special areas. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1"
                                >Nitze</persName> urged the advantages of early action. Since the
                            immediate tension had lessened, and the hostile actions of the West
                            Berliners which had caused the Soviets to put their troops into <gloss
                                target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>’s are not continuing, this was an
                            appropriate moment for us to ask the Soviets to return to buses. He
                            referred to the arguments of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCEJ1"
                                >Hulick</persName> in Berlin 282 (attached).<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d107fn3">Telegram 282, August 28, analyzed the shift from

                                    >APC</gloss>s with armed guards at Checkpoint Charlie to
                                compliance with the U.S. regulation on Soviet movements in West
                                Berlin. The telegram suggested that this was not a Soviet
                                “backdown,” but more likely a desire not to precipitate a crisis
                                over access to West Berlin. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                762.00/8–2862)</note></p>
                        <p>The President asked why it would not be sufficient response to an East
                            German request for papers from our troops, to deny ourselves entrance to
                            East Berlin, and then admit the Soviets on credentials good only at the
                            Brandenberg Gate. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>
                            thought this would be an inadequate response, and that neither the
                            Soviets nor the Germans would feel it sufficiently forceful. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> remarked that
                            relations between East and West Berlin were a microcosm of relations
                            between West Germany and Berlin, and we should consider any action
                            within Berlin in this light. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2"
                                >Bundy</persName> pointed to the central question of what trade we
                            were willing to make. In his judgment our access rights in East Berlin
                            for their access rights in West Berlin was an advantageous trade. Mayor
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> shared this view, and
                            had indeed urged it.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether a request for passes was an appropriate issue
                            on which to hand such a trade. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2"
                                >Bundy</persName> responded that the significance of the request was
                            not as important as the problem of substantive judgment on whether or
                            not the trade was in our interest. If it was, we should find the
                            earliest occasion to make it. The Secretary pointed out the asymmetry of
                            the “paper” issue. Since the Soviet Union and the East Germans wish to
                            create a state frontier at the sector boundary, they would be happy to
                            show whatever papers we asked for.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that he saw no specific danger in Soviet presence
                            at the War Memorial, <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss> and Spandau.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> responded that the issue was not
                            their presence. The issue was our control of the terms on which they
                            could come to West Berlin. If we <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0315"
                            />did not assert our control, then we would be moving rapidly to a
                            Four-Power West Berlin. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1"
                                >Taylor</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1"
                                >Nitze</persName> whether we were not in fact already in this state;
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> thought not yet.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> asked that we return to
                            the question of what should be done now. He would recommend that we
                            request the Russians to return to the use of buses and indicate that we
                            will not permit entry in <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>’s. The
                            President asked whether he would recommend that we require them to come
                            through the Brandenberg Gate as well. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1"
                                >Nitze</persName> said he was willing to wait on this point.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether we have ever sent tanks or other armoured
                            vehicles into East Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRM2"
                                >Brandin</persName> responded that we have sent tanks only as far as
                            the Friederichstrasse checkpoint. Our own patrols in East Berlin have
                            been made in jeeps; the soldiers do carry side arms. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> remarked that if the Soviets come
                            through the Brandenberg Gate, the use of <gloss target="#t_APC1"
                                >APC</gloss>’s is no longer an issue, since they in fact are not
                            going through any significant part of West Berlin. The President asked
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> to repeat his argument,
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> again stated that
                            the central issue was our control of Soviet access for West Berlin. In
                            answer to the President’s question as to whether this was in doubt, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> cited the Soviet
                            protests on the issue of our escorts for their <gloss target="#t_APC1"
                                >APC</gloss>’s as evidence of their efforts to erode our control.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said that we had yielded to this
                            protest, in part at least, by agreeing to describe our accompanying
                            vehicles in other terms than as “escorts.”</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether we should tie permission for the Soviets to
                            use <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>’s to acceptance of our escorts.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> responded that we
                            should not accept any restrictions on the use of our own vehicles in
                            West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The President summarized the issues as follows. Should we do something
                            now or wait? Should we confine the Soviets to the use of the Brandenberg
                            Gate and permit <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>’s? Should we give
                            the Soviets the choice of coming in buses or using the Brandenberg Gate,
                            or should we give them only the alternatives of exclusion or the use of
                            the buses through the Brandenberg Gate? Should the War Memorial be in
                            the category of <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss> and Spandau as
                            points to which we would continue to permit Soviet entry even if we
                            excluded them from the rest of West Berlin, or should it be treated
                            along with the rest of West Berlin? The Secretary indicated that he
                            would have the outgoing telegram re-drafted to request comment on these
                            questions. He agreed that as presently drafted it seemed to reflect
                            decisions on some of them, which in fact have not yet been taken. In
                            response to the President’s question, he said that the draft had not
                            been discussed quadripartitely.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> pointed out that if we
                            are going to make any request, we must be prepared to respond to Soviet
                            refusal to accede to it. He would recommend that we block their access
                            to West Berlin if they do not accede <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294"
                                facs="0316"/>to whatever request we think appropriate. The President
                            again raised the question of whether we should take the initiative in
                            making a request or wait to respond to some Soviet move. His own
                            inclination was to wait. The Secretary pointed out that we were dealing
                            with a symbolic, rather than in a substantive realm. The problem
                            essentially is how do we give the Soviets an unmistakable signal as to
                            our intentions within West Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1"
                                >Nitze</persName> thought it was better to take the risks of action
                            now than to defer them.</p>
                        <p>The President then remarked that he saw no harm in the <gloss
                                target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>’s as such, since we could stop them at
                            any time. They did not limit our vital rights of access or military
                            presence. Further, we could stop them at any time. The Secretary
                            responded that this was just the problem. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> observed that although the
                            initial use of the <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>’s might have been
                            a natural reaction of the Soviet Commander to the violence offered to
                            his troops, their use was no longer justified. The President said that
                            the reaction of the West Berliners to the <gloss target="#t_APC1"
                                >APC</gloss>’s was understandable and not unexpected, but in itself
                            was not a sufficient reason for us to take action. Further, it might
                            have been easy if we had prevented the entry of the <gloss
                                target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>’s at their first appearance, but now we
                            were in a different position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1"
                                >Nitze</persName> pointed out that the West Berliners’ feelings were
                            not the issue, but rather our confrontation with the Soviets. The
                            President again raised the question of whether we should take the
                            initiative, and indicated that he preferred to respond to a Soviet move
                            that went outside the existing rules.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary raised the question of whether it might be useful to move
                            in the opposite direction by putting more American and other Western
                            troops in East Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> pointed out the
                            possible difficulties our troops could create for us. The arrest of a
                            number of American soldiers, in the absence of a Soviet Commandant in
                            Berlin, might well put the President in a difficult position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> went on to review the
                            problem of passes. He pointed out that last year we engaged our prestige
                            on the issue of whether American military personnel would show passes to
                            East Germans, and we succeeded in making our point. If we now retreated
                            from this position, the Soviets and Germans both would read it as
                            weakness. The President agreed that American military personnel should
                            not show passes to get into East Berlin and that we should rather deny
                            ourselves entry. He observed that on the Autobahn the situation was of
                            course different. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>
                            remarked that if we denied ourselves access to East Berlin, in order to
                            avoid showing passes to East Germans, we must at that point cut off
                            Soviet access to West Berlin. Without Soviet presence in East Berlin,
                            there was no justification for a Soviet presence in West Berlin. He
                            repeated Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>’s point
                            that we no longer have any important interest <pb n="295"
                                xml:id="pg_295" facs="0317"/>in access to East Berlin, and therefore
                            we should not trade anything in West Berlin for access to East
                            Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the alternative might be to limit the Soviets
                            to the three areas mentioned, and again raised the question of timing.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> gave his view that now
                            was the time to deal with the <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>’s. The
                            President expressed his preference for staying on our pres-ent position
                            for the moment. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            pointed out that we had a middle course of action; namely, requiring
                            that the Soviets use the Brandenberg Gate for <gloss target="#t_APC1"
                                >APC</gloss>’s going to the War Memorial. The Secretary said that
                            this was also the notion of the British Commandant. He observed that we
                            probably could get Allied agreement to restrict access to the three
                            places mentioned under specified contingencies. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> remarked that in order to come
                            out with this result, we had to push for a great deal more, rather than
                            merely ask for it.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that the message be revised to reflect the
                            discussion and sent out. In response to the President’s question, the
                            Secretary gave his judgment that it was not an appropriate moment to
                            send General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> back to
                            Berlin.</p>

                            <item>We agree that one possible interpretation of recent Soviet actions
                                is that their efforts are directed toward complete elimination
                                Allied position in East Berlin and strengthening Soviet presence in
                                West Berlin. <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0318"/>Even before

                                action against their position West Berlin, by switching equation
                                from Allied position in East Berlin versus Soviet position in West

                                do this in two ways, by increasing our presence in East Berlin
                                and/or by reducing Soviet presence in West Berlin.</item>

                            <item>With regard to Allied presence in East Berlin, we believe it is
                                questionable as to how much we can accomplish. Our presence in East
                                Berlin is not, however, in itself of same fundamental importance to
                                us as Soviet position in West Berlin probably is to Soviets. We
                                believe, however, we might consider expanding our activities in East
                                Berlin, such as uniform personnel in official cars. We have also
                                considered possibility of increasing travel into East Berlin by
                                individuals, but wonder whether this would be desirable.</item>

                                toward control of Soviet movement in West Berlin. On basis that the
                                shorter the distance travelled the less likely there will be
                                difficulty, we could, for example, insist that Soviets enter West

                        <p>The Secretary opened by asking General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1"
                                >Clay</persName> when he was last in Europe.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> said he had been in
                            Europe ten days ago, just after the refugee PETER FECHTER had been shot
                            at the wall. He had seen Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the East Germans had been putting out the line that
                            they had not gone to the assistance of Fechter out of fear of the West
                            Berlin police.</p>
                        <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0320"/>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> said that a similar
                            incident had happened before in the British sector, but there had been
                            no crowds to witness the event.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that one subject that is currently under consideration
                            is how to bring into balance the question of East and West military
                            personnel entering East and West Berlin. He said there were two ways
                            this could be accomplished: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>we could increase our presence in East Berlin; or</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>we could cut back Soviet bloc presence in West Berlin.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>It is feared that the Soviets might achieve a quadripartite West Berlin
                            and then equate their access to West Berlin to our access to West
                            Berlin. He said he would appreciate General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1"
                                >Clay</persName>’s reactions.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> responded that if we
                            were not careful we would soon face the alternatives of either shooting
                            or getting out of West Berlin if we waited until our vital interests
                            were affected. We should try to avoid being faced with these
                            alternatives. He would increase the Western presence in East Berlin. He
                            would put an end to the use of the <gloss target="#t_APC1"
                            >APC</gloss>’s. If the Soviets interfere with our increased presence in
                            East Berlin, he would take action against Soviet personnel in West
                            Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName>’s
                            views about action against the Czech and Polish Military Missions.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> said he did not think
                            such action would have much immediate value concerning Berlin other than
                            to impress the Czechs and Poles with the seriousness with which we view
                            the situation. He added that he would force the Soviets to interfere
                            first with our increased presence in East Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would appreciate General <persName
                                corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName>’s comments on whether or not we
                            would risk increased conflicts with the East German police if we
                            increase our presence in East Berlin, an idea which he, incidentally,
                            found attractive.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> said this would
                            provide a logical excuse for running the Soviets out of West Berlin. He
                            felt that cutting both Western presence in East Berlin and Eastern
                            presence in West Berlin would look like a sign of weakness.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he still got the impression that the Germans and
                            French are not really thinking hard concerning what can be done. We
                            haven’t had any sign of their deep interest. They will say that it is
                            important to keep the Soviets from signing a separate peace treaty, but
                            then they fail to come up with practical measures to this end. The
                            Secretary wondered if General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1"
                                >Clay</persName> had any impression as to what the French and the
                            Germans were thinking about in this connection.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> replied negatively
                            saying that he had stayed away from the Bonn Government on his last trip
                            to Europe inasmuch as it was <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0321"/>a
                            business trip. He said that in his last conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> he gained the impression that
                            the Chancellor was considerably influenced by <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>’s position. He added,
                            however, that he was more concerned about the reactions of the people in
                            Berlin and Germany than he was about the reactions of the Government. He
                            thought recent developments had hurt us with the people primarily
                            because of lack of reaction on our part. The principle now governing
                            seems to be that we do nothing until our vital interests are involved.
                            This really backs us into a corner. We must keep the East off balance.
                            When General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> was in Berlin
                            there was an understanding that an unarmed attempt at rescue would be
                            made in any case similar to the Fechter case. He was puzzled as to why
                            no action had occurred. The Secretary said he did not know whether the
                            necessary information had gotten to the officers concerned in time.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> said he felt that
                            this was no excuse. He continued by saying that the decision to admit
                            the <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>’s had had a very bad effect. The
                            Germans know that we did not send armored vehicles in through Checkpoint
                            Charlie because we considered it would be provocative. And yet we have
                            admitted the Soviet <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>’s. He did not
                            think this could be interpreted as anything except a Soviet move for a
                            quadripartite West Berlin. If we were afraid to move in this area
                            because of fear of retaliation against our autobahn access, we might be
                            afraid to move in cases of harassment of our autobahn access because of
                            fear that this might then threaten air access.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there was no question but that we would react to
                            interference with our access. We would move immediately into economic
                            and other sanctions, but he was not sure how far other nations would
                            follow us. Any time we attempted to take steps in the trade field, the
                            others shied away from this. General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1"
                                >Clay</persName> said he did not think particular blame could be
                            attached to the Germans in this regard because the British have more
                            trade with the Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said this might be right, but it would surprise him.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> said that in
                            addition, the movement of Germans into and out of Berlin is tied in with
                            the interzonal trade. No Allied agreement covers the movement of
                            Germans.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued by saying that one of the difficulties was that
                            so many things were not spelled out in workable agreements in the very
                            beginning of the occupation.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> said there was a good
                            deal to be said for this argument, but he didn’t think this would have
                            made much difference after we demobilized.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked where General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1"
                                >Clay</persName> had been in 1945 and 1946.</p>
                        <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0322"/>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> responded that he had
                            been in Berlin.The Secretary said that he was in the Pentagon and the
                            State Department, and that among the colonels there had been a very
                            strong feeling concerning the demobilization. However, the Pentagon had
                            not put up much of a fight against it.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> agreed but said that
                            US officers in Germany had opposed demobilization. If we had kept ten
                            divisions in Germany, there would have been no Eastern bloc. He said
                            that the only charitable thing he could say was that when President
                            Roosevelt entered into the agreements with the Soviets he intended to
                            keep ten divisions in Europe to see that the agreements were carried
                            out. If this had happened the world would look entirely different today.
                            The General said he was unhappy with the present situation because if we
                            did not take the initiative we would soon be backed into a corner.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he knew the President would be interested in General
                                <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName>’s views.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> said he had been
                            shocked at both the lack of assistance for Fechter and the admission of
                            the Soviet armored cars, but it was difficult to be critical of the
                            people in the field who are trying to comply with what they think is
                            desired of them. The only way we can change the course of events is by
                            taking the initiative.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1"
                                >Clay</persName> would have the Soviet troops for the War Memorial
                            moved through the Brandenburg Gate.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> said there would be
                            obvious advantages in doing so because there would only be a short
                            distance to travel, and there would be no crowds. This would remove the
                            necessity for armed escorts. It would be an improvement over the present
                            situation. In addition, the opening of the Brandenburg Gate would be a
                            boost for West Berlin morale. This idea has considerable merit but only
                            if it were a part of a series of things to be done to establish and
                            maintain our position.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1"
                                >Clay</persName> had any travel plans for the immediate future.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> said he did not
                            except that he planned tentatively to go to Berlin with the Atlantic
                            Council in November.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there seemed to be some difference between Mayor
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> and Bonn. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> was trying to get more
                            circulation across the wall, and this would mean more dealings with the
                            East Germans.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> said the West
                            Berliners were a little more realistic and were unconcerned about minor
                            forms of recognition. This is a political issue in West Germany but not
                            in Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> has to live
                            with the situation, and the Chancellor doesn’t. Increased circulation
                            would have considerable effect in relieving tensions. The Secretary said
                            he had seen <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0323"/>a report that the
                            East Germans were trying to make an assessment of East German feeling
                            about the wall.<note n="1" xml:id="d109fn1">Not further

                            had trouble in getting police to guard the wall. He thought the East
                            German forces along the wall would be tougher without the Russians than
                            if the Russians were there.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked how much effort the West Berliners were putting into
                            attempts to seduce the East German police covertly.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> said he felt they

                                “appreciably” the presence of U.S. soldiers in East Berlin and

                                >Grewe</persName> at 11:30 this morning for his farewell call and

                            being assigned as the German representative. He added that the
                            appointment of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FTK1"
                                >Finletter</persName> indicated our great interest in the <gloss

                            Council will increase.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that his predecessor on the Council, <persName>von
                                Walther</persName>, had been a distinguished representative and he
                            was looking forward to his own work. He expressed the opinion it might
                            be useful to have some representative from the Ambassadorial Group on
                            Berlin speak to the Council from time to time on the work of the group.
                            He thought the Council felt it had not received in the past a full and
                            up-to-date briefing.</p>

                        <p>The President referred to newspaper reports of the Chancellor’s recent TV
                            interview regarding Great Britain’s entry into the Common Market and
                            asked the Ambassador what he thought. The Ambassador somewhat
                            embarrassedly explained that <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
                                >Macmillan</persName> in his answer to a question in the House of
                            Commons in July had stated that entry into the Common Market did not
                            mean entry into a European political union. There then followed
                                <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName>’s letter of July 25
                            to the Chancellor seeking to clarify this statement.<note n="1"

                                123–125.</note> The Chancellor in his TV interview was merely
                            reflecting the earlier <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName>
                            statement. The Chancellor’s remarks had been interpreted in a negative
                            way and perhaps the formulation had been unfortunate. The President
                            asked in view of the Rome Treaty how one could separate the economic
                            from the political union of Europe to which the Ambassador replied that
                            the political union was not formally linked with the Treaty, but in
                            substance, of course, it could not be separated. The German public as
                            well as most of the German political leaders realized this and he was
                            sure Germany supported Britain’s entry.</p>

                            Western Foreign Ministers’ Meeting to which the Ambassador replied that
                            since it was a German suggestion, they had been happy about the
                            President’s press conference statement.<note n="2" xml:id="d110fn2">For

                                <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0325"/>meet in view of the new
                            problems and the new situation which had arisen in Berlin. The President
                            expressed agreement that a meeting should take place some time in the

                        <p>In reply to the President’s general question on this subject, the
                            Ambassador expressed the opinion that the Soviets would not raise the
                            question of Berlin in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in a
                            specific manner since they probably estimate the votes would go against
                            any change in the status quo. The Soviets might discuss Berlin and
                            Germany in general in the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> in order to
                            persuade the neutrals of the justice of Soviet proposals and to create a
                            favorable atmosphere to carry out further Soviet intentions.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador continued that the Soviets would probably emphasize the
                            existence of two German states and the need for both to enter the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. This had a certain appeal to the
                            neutrals. It would be necessary to explain to them that this favors the
                            Soviet viewpoint. Moreover, there was a problem of non-recognition which
                            has become even more difficult.</p>

                        <p>Picking up the Ambassador’s last remark, the President asked whether we
                            could through the years continue to persuade other governments not to
                            recognize the East German regime. The Ambassador said “yes” but that
                            sacrifices would be necessary. Bonn was considering all aspects of this
                            question but it was a painful decision. The President wondered whether
                            the Soviets would pay rather heavily to get this non-recognition policy
                            reconsidered and whether it was possible we might get something better
                            rather than undergo a gradual erosion of our position. The Ambassador
                            expressed some doubt that the Soviets would be willing to pay anything
                            for recognition and pointed out the great difficulty for West Germany
                            because all their old policies and indeed the Constitution would have to
                            be revised if the non-recognition policy were abandoned. The President
                            expressed appreciation of the internal difficulties. The Ambassador
                            added that he was speaking only personally on this subject as he had no
                            authorization to raise the question.</p>

                            Soviet War Memorial in the British sector. There was a question whether
                            we should prohibit or limit them. What were the Ambassador’s <pb n="304"
                                xml:id="pg_304" facs="0326"/>views? The Ambassador felt the problem
                            was the Soviet attempt to equate their access to <gloss
                                target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss>, Spandau, and the War Memorial with
                            Western access to West Berlin. The problem of <gloss target="#t_APC1"
                                >APC</gloss>’s was important from a psychological point of view. He
                            expressed the opinion it was important now to equate Western patrols in
                            East Berlin with Soviet access to the War Memorial and Spandau. The
                            important point was reciprocity. The President remarked the question was
                            whether to prohibit the <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>’s from
                            coming since the necessity for them had passed. Perhaps we should
                            require them to go through the Brandenburg Gate in the future but not to
                            permit them to use <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>’s to Spandau.</p>

                        <p>The President said he appreciated the Chancellor’s reply to his latest

                            believed the exchange had been useful. The Ambassador agreed but
                            expressed the opinion it was necessary to have more personal
                            contacts—not necessarily between the President and the Chancellor but,
                            for example, between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"

                            had arisen from a change in US strategic concepts which was necessary.
                            He was hopeful that viewpoints now had been brought much closer
                            particularly through meetings between <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1"
                                >Strauss</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>. He realized there
                            were different accents in US and European strategic concepts. The
                            President referred to a talk he had with a “European” yesterday<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d110fn5">This conversation has not been further
                                identified.</note> who wondered whether the US would really carry
                            out its nuclear commitment to defend Europe. The President had replied,
                            of course, but the very question revealed a strong current of disbelief
                            which was probably encouraged by the French. The President added there
                            should be no doubt of a US commitment since US security was so
                            intimately tied to Europe’s.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador answered that he fully believed this as his speeches in
                            this country attested. He admitted there was an unhappy influence from
                            the French side which we should try to counter.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous</hi></p>
                        <p>The President referred to the fact the Ambassador had been here during
                            two Administrations and during times which had been difficult and
                            expressed his opinion that relations between the two countries were
                            basically sound though they had their ups and downs like all relations.
                            He commented <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0327"/>that the
                            Ambassador had the chance in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> for
                            very effective service in the common cause.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he looked back with great pleasure on his service in
                            Washington and thought that something had been achieved during his tour
                            of office. The Alliance had passed through difficult times, particularly
                            last year, but had met the test on the whole well. We had agreed on
                            sharing financial burdens, there had been an enormous increase in
                            exchanges, etc.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to a University of Michigan survey on the American
                            mood toward Germany and contrasted it with the Shirer book. The
                            Ambassador replied he thought the mood of the great majority of
                            Americans toward Germany was favorable but a certain circle of
                            intellectuals was quite negative. Their influence was out of proportion
                            to their numbers and they had a certain appeal.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then remarked he wanted to emphasize how much he
                            appreciated the President making himself available to see him on
                            frequent occasions and he wished to stress the good cooperation which he
                            had enjoyed with the Department of State. He said he realized some of
                            the arguments he had used, he would not have used in the President’s
                            position but he hoped the President realized he had to speak of German
                            national interests.</p>
                        <p>The President concluded by again expressing his appreciation of the
                            Ambassador’s efforts through a difficult period. Since 1958 the
                            exist-ence of Soviet missiles had made operations more hazardous and
                            most people did not appreciate that we were operating under a much more
                            difficult pattern than before. He expressed agreement with the
                            Ambassador’s remarks on the usefulness of more frequent meetings and
                            again expressed the thought the recent exchange of letters with the
                            Chancellor had been helpful. The Ambassador remarked that the Chancellor
                            is 86 and had deep-rooted distrust. The President remarked that the
                            period of <persName>John Foster Dulles</persName> was often referred to
                            as “rosy” in our relations but that if we really looked back at that
                            period there had been difficult times too. The Ambassador agreed.</p>
                        <p>The meeting closed with a mutual exchange of courtesies.</p>

                            suggestions made in Berlin’s 307 and 310. As far as General <persName
                                corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName>’s views are concerned I agree with
                            basic thesis but would like to add following observation on tactics we
                            might utilize in dealing with <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>
                            presence in West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The Russians have a real interest in maintaining a presence in West
                            Berlin, not only as a means of influencing a possible Berlin settlement
                            but also in providing themselves with a means to intimidate Western
                            policy and action on access to West Berlin. Course of events since
                            construction of wall, culminating in action of 22 August shows that
                            while they may be willing to liquidate 4-power structure, they strongly
                            wish to retain unilateral right of presence in West Berlin. This
                            presence is important to them not only in symbolic and prestige terms,
                            but in important process of equating their access to West Berlin through
                            Friedrichstrasse with Allied access to West Berlin. As pointed out in
                            previous messages, they are not interested in equating <gloss
                                target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> entry into West Berlin with Allied
                            entry into East Berlin, since East Berlin was sealed off by the wall and
                            would be closed completely at any time by administrative requirements
                            concerning identification. Addition of jeeps to <gloss target="#t_SOV1"
                                >Sov</gloss><gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>’s may indicate that
                            Sovs are attempting to make their “convoys” to war memorial even look
                            like Allied convoys on Autobahn, thus emphasizing that they are seeking
                            to establish this equation.</p>
                        <p>Aside from connection between <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> access
                            to West Berlin and Allied access to West Berlin, presence of <gloss
                                target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> forces at war memorial and Spandau has
                            intense emotional and symbolic significance for Russians. They simply
                            could not leave an unprotected war memorial in West Berlin <pb n="307"
                                xml:id="pg_307" facs="0329"/>or risk the release of Hess, Shirach
                            and Speer without profound effect on their propaganda of unilateral
                            victory in World War II and their charges of continued activity by
                            “Hitlerites” and “revanchists”.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, Soviets would not willingly relinquish their rights concerning
                            memorial and Spandau and I believe they would go a long way in making
                            certain concessions or seeking time before forced to do so. In no sense,
                            would they give up these rights without intense retaliation.</p>
                        <p>I do not place as much emphasis on our presence in East Berlin as a basis
                            for cutting off West Berlin to <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s. Our
                            continued presence in East Berlin serves no definite purpose and actual
                            or symbolic presence of our forces there has only marginal utility in
                            relation to our greater objectives in West Berlin. If we send increased
                            numbers US personnel into East Berlin as a means of policy, we simply
                            invite a program of individual harassment which would immerse us in a
                            maze of protests obscuring our basic objectives.</p>
                        <p>As set out in <gloss target="#t_MYTEL1">mytel</gloss> from Berlin,<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d111fn3">See <ref target="#d104fn1">footnote 1,
                                    Document 104</ref>.</note> we should now concentrate on
                            containment and control of <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> presence
                            in West Berlin rather than to strive towards any symbolic or propaganda
                            advantages in maintaining our presence in the East sector. Therefore, I
                            agree with Gen <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName> that under no
                            circumstances must we show identification as a price of entering the
                            East sector.</p>
                        <p>I agree completely with Gen <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName>
                            about presence of <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss><gloss

                                762.00/8–3162)</note> we have proposed plan which would lead to
                            their removal from scene. While breaching wall at Brandenburg Gate may
                            be too much to hope for, we could settle for Sandkrug Bridge but insist
                            that Sov guards travel in buses rather than in armored cars.</p>
                        <p>For reasons advanced, most effective way to deal with <gloss
                                target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s would be to institute selective
                            controls on entry of <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> war memorial
                            and Spandau guards rather than by instituting a blanket prohibition
                            which would include <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss> personnel. If
                                <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s equate their entry with Allied
                            access to W. Berlin, we could by various initiatives control, or
                            prohibit, their access to objectives in W. Berlin which they too may
                            consider important for their purposes. While we should seek by various
                            means to prevent the Sovs drawing a precise relationship between West
                            Berlin and Allied access routes, we should recognize that this is
                            precisely what they may do. Therefore, we should be prepared to deny
                            them access to West Berlin on same grounds they may hinder our access,
                            rather than becoming involved in East sector.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss> is an entirely different matter.
                            Just as it in Soviet interest to maintain physical presence at memorial,
                            it is certainly in our interest to <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308"

                            in short, do nothing to make Sov presence in <gloss target="#t_BASC1"
                                >BASC</gloss> impossible as long as they wish to maintain it.</p>
                        <p>One way of assuring this for the time being is to treat Sov presence at
                            war memorial, Spandau and <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss> as
                            separate problems rather than as one. What we should seek to prevent is
                                <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> use of entry for changes of
                            guard at memorial as mechanism for supplying personnel for other Soviet
                            undertakings in West Berlin. Provisions for relieving guard at memorial
                            should be confined to that alone. If and when problem arises about
                            Spandau and <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss>, it should be dealt
                            with in terms of situation existing at that time without connection with

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">K</persName>: I know Nixon and Eisenhower,
                            and I must say that <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> is
                            better in this respect. As a President he has understanding, but what he
                            does not yet have is courage—courage to solve the German question. If he
                            resolves this problem, he will rise to the heights. But he is faced with
                                <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0331"/>the necessity of solving
                            it. Because the German situation is no longer tolerable. A treaty will
                            inevitably be signed. If we and the President can agree, then there will
                            be great opportunities for cooperation in science, technology, and outer
                            space. Without a solution to this problem, our relations will continue
                            to be cancerous and exacerbated. So we will help him solve the problem.
                            We will put him in a situation where it is necessary to solve it. We
                            will give him a choice—go to war, or sign a peace treaty. We will not
                            allow your troops to be in Berlin. We will permit access to West Berlin
                            for economic or commercial purposes, but not for military purposes.
                            Everybody is saying nowadays that there will be a war. I don’t agree.
                            Sensible people won’t start a war. What is Berlin to the United States?
                            And a war could easily began there—if someone struck a blow at us, we
                            would strike back. Do you need Berlin? Like hell you need it. Nor do we
                            need it. But the President is not in a position to come to agreement.
                            I’m telling you this off the record—I don’t want to hurt your chances in
                            the November elections. The President is boxed in—he can’t move. To sum
                            it up, Congress won’t let him come to terms. If he had support in
                            Congress, he could come to terms. But as it now stands, if the two of us
                            made an agreement, Congress would veto it. You remember when Nixon came
                            here, and Congress had just declared Captive Nations Week. I asked him,
                            “Was that very smart?” He said, “I never would have done such a thing
                            myself, but I can’t vouch for fools in the Congress.” I’m telling you
                            this just between you and me. But you have many such fools in
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p><persName>U</persName>: There are some who are demagogues in the negative
                            sense.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">K</persName>: They should be gotten rid of.
                            And so—we’ll sign a peace treaty. If any lunatics in your country want
                            war, Western Europe will hold them back. Except for <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1"
                                >DeGaulle</persName>—those two have some unusual ideas of their own.
                            But they will get wise in a hurry. War in this day and age means no
                            Paris and no France, all in the space of an hour. It’s been a long time
                            since you could spank us like a little boy—now we can swat your ass. So
                            let’s not talk about force. We’re equally strong. You want Berlin.
                            Access to it goes through East Germany. We have the advantage. If you
                            want to do anything, you have to start a war. And nowadays that course
                            is insanity. We ourselves will not start a war. We don’t need one, nor
                            do you. The economy of your country is more developed than ours, but
                            ours will be as strong as yours one day. So, let us have peaceful
                            competition. But we can have peace and come to agreement sooner once the
                            Berlin issue is eliminated. Out of respect for your President we won’t
                            do anything until November. If it depends on us, there will be no war. I
                            think the reply of the President to our note on the <gloss
                                target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-2 was satisfactory from this
                            standpoint.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of unrelated subjects.]</p>
                        <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0332"/>
                        <p><persName>U</persName>: Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for the
                            opportunity to meet with you. I will respect your request to keep these
                            remarks off the record, and will convey your messages to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">K</persName>: Yes—tell the press we talked
                            about electric power plants.</p>
                        <p><persName>U</persName>: Yes, I would like to tell them of our discussion
                            of power stations and water development. On Berlin, the President has
                            made his position very clear. He shares your views about the insanity,
                            the suicide of nuclear war. He is a strong leader—a courageous man, a
                            man of steel, just as you are. You, the President, and I myself were all
                            participants in the last World War. The President respects your problems
                            and your position, and you should attempt to understand his position on
                            this grave question. I am sure the President has no greater ambition
                            than to solve the Berlin problem peacefully, and to put an end to
                            nuclear weapons testing, which has been the topic of discussion at
                            Geneva. This is a time of dangers, and he will always do his best to
                            find peaceful solutions to world problems.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">K</persName>: We wish him success. We will
                            freeze the Berlin question until November. Then he and I will continue
                            our dialogue. I don’t know what its outcome will be, but we will sign a
                            peace treaty with Germany. Then we shall see whether you bring us to the
                            brink of war. It takes two to jump at the brink; one person can’t jump
                            alone—and you have many on your side who must jump together (motioning
                            with his hands). I personally do not want to jump. Please give my best
                            personal regards to the President, his family, and his daughter from me
                            and my wife.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary, who had not yet seen the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>
                                communique,<note n="1" xml:id="d113fn1">For text of the September 7
                                communiqué, see <hi rend="italic">Dokumente zur Deutschlandpolitik,
                                    1962</hi>, pp. 1045–1046.</note> inquired of Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> as to its contents.
                            The Ambassador, who had just seen the communique, outlined very briefly
                            its major points. The Secretary commented that it would appear that the
                            communique contained a good deal more than such documents usually
                            do.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> repeated that
                            the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> visit had gone very
                            well especially in its public relations aspects. The fact that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> speaks some German had been
                            helpful. The Ambassador said that the press had played up the dramatic
                            aspects of the visit, noting that this was the first time a French Chief
                            of State had paid a state visit to Germany since 921 A.D.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> said he hoped
                            that the United States would not consider the <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> understandings and the Franco-German
                            rapprochement to be against U.S. interests. The Secretary said certainly
                            not. At the expense of appearing somewhat naive he still felt he should
                            point out that the United States had been engaged in two major world
                            conflicts in which France and Germany were on opposite sides. An
                            understanding between France and Germany for the drawing together of
                            those two countries was therefore very much to be desired. On the other
                            hand, however, if it should develop that there was contemplated <pb

                            and the Atlantic Community, the United States would very definitely be
                            disturbed. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName>
                            emphasized that such intent had been expressly denied.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador inquired as to how the Secretary saw events developing
                            with regard to Berlin. The Secretary said that he had asked our
                            intelligence people to prepare an assessment of the current situation
                            and future probabilities and that we would share this assessment with
                            the French and our other allies in the next meeting on Berlin. The
                            Secretary had a hunch that we are in for a serious time. The Soviets
                            might withdraw from the air security center and attempt to insist that
                            we fly from Schoenfeld. There may also be harassment in the air corridor
                            to Berlin and indications of a Soviet build up of antiaircraft weapons
                            in the corridor pointed this way. The Secretary said he could tell the
                            Ambassador very privately that we may need to ask further congressional
                            authority for calling up reserve troops.<note n="2" xml:id="d113fn2"

                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that we are concerned by the German defense
                            budget reduction which may signal to Moscow a lack of sense of urgency,
                            determination and firm common purpose.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if there were any possibility that an additional
                            French division might be assigned to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. The Ambassador replied that French troops returning
                            from Algeria are being modernized and re-equipped. He was not in a
                            position to say if any additional forces could be committed to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Secretary asked if the
                            modernization of the French troops is something the Soviets could pick
                            up. The Ambassador thought that the Soviets were well aware of this.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> asked if the
                            Secretary anticipated a separate peace treaty between the Soviets and
                            East Germany. The Secretary said that he did not think this likely
                            within the next few weeks but that it could possibly happen before the
                            end of the year. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9"
                                >Alphand</persName> said that the French Foreign Minister shares
                            this view.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would like to comment on the Cuban situation in
                            connection with possible Soviet moves regarding Berlin. It appears that
                            the Soviets are making a hurried crash effort at antiaircraft
                            installations in Cuba. While there have been some tanks and other arms
                            sent to Cuba, by far the greatest part of recent Soviet military
                            shipments to Cuba has been antiaircraft materiel. The Soviets are
                            training Cubans in the operation of this equipment which they have never
                            done before. <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0335"/>This may be a sign
                            that the Soviets expect a serious crisis in Berlin and want to put Cuba
                            in the best possible position to resist any U.S. move which we might be
                            tempted to make as a result of an emergency in Berlin. The Soviets may
                            be trying to anticipate and get braced for a Berlin crisis. We should
                            not link Soviet actions in Cuba too closely to Berlin but they may be an
                            indicator.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said of course the United States would not trade an easing
                            of the Cuban situation for concessions in Berlin. He commented in
                            passing that we do not understand the recurring waves of alerts in
                            Cuba.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed appreciation to Ambassador <persName

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> said the French
                            are concerned for the entire Caribbean area, and for the effects on the

                                    >Alphand</persName> also asked whether the United States was
                                considering bringing the Berlin question before the United Nations,
                                expressing the French view that the United Nations was not competent

                                that the United States would not take such an initiative unless

                            have not been met.</p>
                        <p>Three basic differences remain. First, there is General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName>’s objection to the concept of
                            the sequence paper. General <persName corresp="#p_NGLC1"
                                >Norstad</persName> questions the political and military wisdom of
                            our spelling out in any such form our view of the possible sequence of
                            events in Berlin. He also thinks it unrealistic to attempt to predict
                            such a sequence. Instead, he prefers the cataloguing of possible actions
                            to meet the Soviet challenge without putting such actions in any
                            specific order. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>, on the
                            other hand—and this is also the view of the Departments of State and
                            Defense and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>—denies that the
                            sequence paper is intended to establish a hard and fast line of
                            development. It is a conceptual framework for planning purposes,
                            spelling out challenges from the other side.</p>
                        <p>Second, there is the question of procedure. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName> argues for an oral
                            presentation rather than the tabling of a written document. Apart from
                            his apparent concern about possible leaks, he claims that this effort
                            will be misunderstood and lead to unnecessary confusion and division in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1"
                                >Paul Nitze</persName> denies this. He insists that introduced in an
                            appropriate context, and given a proper explanation of the sequence
                            paper’s uses and limitations, a written document is a more manageable
                            vehicle for these purposes than an oral briefing and less likely to be
                            misinterpreted and/or misunderstood by the individual representatives in
                            the Council.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, there is a remaining substantive difference which is somewhat
                            camouflaged by the language of the paper. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName> objects strongly to the
                            restrictions the sequence paper imposes on the use of nuclear weapons
                            prior to Phase IV. As the responsible military commander <pb n="315"
                                xml:id="pg_315" facs="0337"/>in the field, he feels these
                            restrictions tie him down unnecessarily and deny him the means he needs
                            to carry out his mission. Like the French and Germans, although probably
                            for different reasons, he tends to favor a selective use of nuclear
                            weapons earlier in the scheme, after less extensive non-nuclear
                            combatant action than the U.S. Government (as reflected in <gloss

                                >Nitze</persName>, however, claims that the use of nuclear weapons
                            at a point in the sequence scheme which General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName> seems to prefer, would not
                            really serve the purposes allegedly intended. Moreover, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> denies that the language of the
                            paper dealing with the use of nuclear weapons is over-restrictive. He
                            considers that the language now incorporated at the end of paragraph 2
                            of the general introduction provides whatever leeway is really needed to
                            deal with the problems as they develop.</p>

                            IN A BERLIN CONFLICT</p>

                        <p>1. In its instructions to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military
                            authorities, CM(61)104,<note n="1" xml:id="d115fn1">Not found.</note>
                            the Council expressed several considerations that ought to underlie
                            Berlin planning. One dealt with the need for military and other actions
                            to fit <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0338"/>together in an overall
                            strategy. The Council has previously been informed concerning the
                            tripartite Live Oak military plans, and the Council has before it a
                            paper on the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Tripartite
                            relationship. <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>’s and <gloss
                                target="#t_SACLANT1">SACLANT</gloss>’s plans, along with the
                            appraisal by the Standing Group in consultation with the Military
                            Committee, have now come before the Council. It yet remains to be seen
                            how these tripartite and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military
                            actions might fit in relation to each other and to the various
                            non-military activities that likewise would be part of the overall
                            strategy seeking to preserve vital Alliance interests.</p>
                        <p>2. The Council may therefore wish to give attention to what would be my
                            government’s conception of the preferred sequence of military actions in
                            the event military force must be used in the Berlin situation. It cannot
                            be too strongly emphasized that the account which follows will always be
                            subject to the nature of Soviet action, and in this connection the
                            Allies must be prepared at all times to use nuclear weapons if the
                            nature of the Soviet response clearly requires their use in accordance
                            with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> guidelines on use agreed at
                                Athens.<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2">For documentation on the North
                                Atlantic Council meeting at Athens May 4–6, see <ref

                        <p>3. In the account which follows, the extensive non-military actions which
                            would be taken are broadly described merely to cross-reference their
                            general timing relative to military actions. No attempt has been made to
                            describe Western reaction if Soviet action should threaten <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> territory or integrity beyond the
                            point of a Berlin blockade, since it is assumed that present <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategy would be applied in such
                            event.</p>
                        <p>4. Any attempt to set out a preferred sequence of Western action has to
                            remain rather general and cannot establish firmly separated categories
                            and concepts for various phases. Soviet action against Western access to
                            Berlin can be initiated in various ways whose differing natures would
                            tend to influence Western reactions to a large degree.</p>
                        <p>5. Governmental decisions will be necessary for implementation of any of
                            the military plans at the time. Several factors which bear decisively on
                            such decisions will remain of uncertain nature and indeterminable
                            relative weight. Such factors are, for example: Soviet reaction to prior
                            military and non-military moves in a heightening crisis, the danger of
                            stimulating uprising and revolt in East Germany or satellite areas, the
                            state of world and home opinion, and the relative state of Western and
                            Soviet mobilization.</p>
                        <p>6. Governments will also have to consider whether steps are necessary to
                            ensure that the Soviet Union remains in no doubt as to the continued
                            validity of the existing Western guarantees for West Berlin.</p>
                        <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0339"/>
                        <p>7. The broad, general considerations relating to progress through the
                            several phases are: <list>

                                <item>There is a compelling necessity for the Allies to succeed in
                                    protecting their vital interests relating to Berlin and to
                                    ensure that this success is recognized in the Free World. They
                                    should make clear to the Soviet Union the enormous risks
                                    involved in opposing Allied communications to Berlin by force.
                                    The purpose of Allied operations, however, should not be to
                                    overpower the Soviet Union or to disintegrate the satellite
                                    area, but to make the Soviet government change their policy on
                                    Berlin. Therefore, the Allies should give the Soviet Union
                                    opportunity to draw back and even—without creating the
                                    appearance of failure on our part—help them to cover up this
                                    retreat.</item>

                                    readiness for war. The most effective means of inducing the
                                    Soviet Union to change their policy may be intensive

                                    the military side might include, for example, mobilization,
                                    build-up and deployment of forces, certain alert measures,
                                    certain maritime and air measures, and, on the non-military
                                    side, economic embargo measures and diplomatic actions.</item>

                            other action interferes with Berlin access by ground or air the Allies
                            will initiate action designed to deter Soviet/“<gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>” continued or additional interference and, failing
                            that, to establish the fact that the Soviet Union/“<gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” intends to use force to interfere with
                            Berlin access.</p>
                        <p>9. Planning for the appropriate action to meet a variety of contingencies
                            (interference with air access to Berlin, ranging from minor
                            administrative harassment to a determined Soviet effort to interdict all
                            Allied transport; interference with ground access to Berlin, Allied
                            and/or German; harassments within Berlin) is being conducted among the
                            four governments.</p>
                        <p>10. The purpose of such planning is to agree as far as possible in
                            advance what in each contingency would be the appropriate response and
                            countermeasures, with final decisions, however, being reserved for
                            governments at the time, as is normally the case in contingency
                            planning. This planning is continuous and continuing.</p>
                        <p>11. It is hoped that a quick and determined Allied response to the
                            initial Soviet move will deter the Soviets from continued or additional
                                <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0340"/>interference. This proved
                            to be the case in March 1962 when the Soviets initiated harassments in
                            the air corridors.</p>
                        <p>12. If, however, this hope is falsified, and when the degree of
                            interference reaches a point where continued access is in doubt, an
                            Allied military probe of Soviet/“<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>”

                        <p>13. Control of military operations will remain tripartite, but <gloss

                        <p>14. Western action would either restore access or make it clear that
                            force is being used by the Soviet Union/“<gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>” to deny access to Berlin.</p>

                        <p>15. If the actions under Phase I have shown that force is being used by
                            the Soviet Union/“<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” to deny access to
                            Berlin, the Allies will bring increasing pressure, short of offensive
                            combat, to bear on the Soviets in an effort to induce them to desist and
                            re-open access.</p>
                        <p>16. This phase would be characterized by intense diplomatic activity
                            (e.g. representations in Moscow, mobilization of world opinion against
                            the USSR, and any other action which would seem relevant [,(French would

                            mounting Western pressures. These would include a growing military
                            build-up; naval measures (national, tripartite, and/or <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>) and air measures; and economic
                            countermeasures, including repressive measures against Bloc maritime and
                            air traffic, of ascending intensity up to and including a full embargo,
                            together with restrictions on the movement of Soviet Bloc nationals and
                            officials, with the aim ultimately, in this or a later phase, of
                            isolating the Bloc. The aim of all these measures would be to bring
                            increasing pressure to bear on the Soviet Union to restore our rights
                            and vital interests.</p>
                        <p>17. A major element of military action will be for <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations to mobilize and deploy
                            jointly additional military forces, particularly into the Central
                            Region, at an accelerating rate, while at the same time rapidly <pb
                                n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0341"/>increasing the combat readiness
                            of all <gloss target="#t_M1">M</gloss>-Day forces, with the dual purpose
                            of (1) achieving force levels and states of readiness necessary to the
                            defense of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the launching of
                                <gloss target="#t_BERCONMARCON1">BERCON/MARCON</gloss> operations,
                            and (2) displaying to the Soviets that armed conflict will be the
                            consequence of continued infringement on vital Allied interests.</p>
                        <p>18. Any unblocked access to Berlin should continue to be used fully. In
                            the event of partial or intermittent blockage of air access, the three
                            Powers would if necessary use fighter escorts in an effort to keep
                            flights going. Should the risks and loss of aircraft be too great to
                            warrant further flights unless air operations were deliberately extended
                            outside the corridors (i.e., beyond Jack Pine operations), <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would have to face, in the light of
                            the state of the military build-up and the general situation, the
                            necessity for taking appropriate measures concerning air access.</p>
                        <p>19. The length of this phase cannot be forecast since it will depend on
                            the development of events, notably in the air corridors and in Berlin
                            itself. If the blockage of Berlin is total, and if the pressures applied
                            by the Allies lead to violent Soviet response, the Allies may be
                            compelled to move on the operations envisaged for Phase III. But in the
                            absence of such compulsion, there are advantages for the Allies in not
                            moving too early into Phase III, because the growing military build-up
                            will be a firm demonstration of Allied determination to assert their
                            rights in Berlin, and this and other Phase II measures need time to have
                            their impact on the Soviets.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Phase III</hi></p>
                        <p>20. If, despite Allied actions in Phase II, Berlin access has not been
                            restored, the time will have come to draw on the catalog of plans “from
                            which appropriate action would be selected by political authorities in
                            the light of circumstances and with the aim of applying increasing
                            pressure which would present with unmistakable clarity to the Soviets
                            the enormous risks in continued denial of access” (para. 6 (b) of <gloss
                                target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Resolution 104).</p>
                        <p>21. At the present stage of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            deliberations, there is no question of approving the execution of any
                            particular plan since it is laid down in para. 8 of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Resolution that “the execution of
                            approved plans will be the subject of decisions by governments at the
                            time.” The Council may, however, wish at this stage, in the light of the
                            Standing Group’s appraisal in consultation with the Military Committee,
                            and in view of the fundamentally political purposes of the military
                            operations planned, to consider the preferred sequence in which plans
                            might be implemented.</p>
                        <p>22. If there is consensus on the general considerations set out in the
                            introduction to this paper, it would seem to follow, in accordance with
                                <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0342"/>the concept that operations
                            should be graduated but determined, that the initial operations to be
                            executed by the Allies in this phase (possibly after a further
                            appropriate tripartite probe) should be non-nuclear and should not be
                            open to misinterpretation by the Russians as an attack directed at the
                            stability of the Soviet satellite empire (notably East Germany) or on
                            the Soviet nuclear strike capability. Accordingly, the choice would seem
                            to lie among: <list>

                        <p>23. If these operations fail to make the Soviets back down, the courses
                            of action which might achieve <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> aims
                            would be to increase conventionally the scope of the action, to add
                            another action, or to take some form of nuclear action. Without
                            knowledge of the actual circumstances that would exist in such a
                            critical situation, it is hardly possible to judge which of these
                            courses would be chosen at the time. Whichever course is adopted,
                            general war would be imminent. If the course chosen were conventional
                            action and this fails to make the Soviet Union back down and has not
                            precipitated general war, the last remaining pressure to be exerted will
                            be to resort to some form of nuclear action.</p>

                        <p>24. Whenever nuclear action were taken, and whether it were
                            demonstrative, selective, or otherwise, events would have moved into a
                            new phase, dominated by the nuclear equation.</p>

                            corrected troublesome situation which contained constant danger of
                            incident. At same time Sov attempt to exploit use of armor for
                            political-psychological reasons in West Berlin has been halted.</p>
                        <p>More important perhaps is that Allies have regulated a significant
                            element of Sov activity in West Berlin. On their face the actions the
                            Sovs have been induced to take have been minor. However, that Allies
                            have required Sovs to change place of entry and mode of transport for
                            War Memorial guard is significant. It could put allies in better
                            position to deal with anticipated period of Sov efforts exports exploit
                            presence in West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, Allies’ moves presumably have somewhat improved West Berlin
                            confidence. This regard, difficult to evaluate importance of these
                            moves, but it is not likely that of themselves they will do more than
                            reduce the generally negative balance that now exists, or that their
                            effect will be durable in the face of any further Sov encroachments that
                            West is unable or unwilling to rebuff.</p>
                        <p>Return to buses by Sovs puts heavy responsibility on Allies for
                            preventing even minor attacks by West Berliners on these vehicles.
                            British have taken elaborate police precautions on route to Memorial for
                            initial days, and <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> issued
                            good statement Sept 14 to effect West Berliners should not make task of
                            Allies difficult by untoward behavior in this respect. Acid test
                            efficacy of these measures will be next emotion-laden (Fechter-type)
                            incident.</p>
                        <p>Explanation for Sov decisions to change crossing point and return to
                            buses is probably simplest one, namely that issues were not considered
                            by Sovs as propitious, or as important enough, for making stand which
                            could clearly have escalated and might even have resulted in their being
                            denied access to West Berlin entirely. To this degree Sov acquiescence
                            evidence that they value their presence in West Berlin. In addition, by
                            insisting that Allied messages re changes be conveyed via <gloss
                                target="#t_CINC1">CINC</gloss> channel, and by emphasizing this
                            aspect in press treatment on crossing point shift, Sovs undoubtedly
                            hoped drive home point that Allies were forced to comply practically
                            with recent abolition of office of Sov Commandant in East Berlin. (That
                            there was no East German publicity about <gloss target="#t_UKMLM1"
                                >UKMLM</gloss> call on <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss><gloss

                            Sov loss of face over issue.)</p>
                        <p>It must be anticipated that Sovs will exploit these events in future,
                            perhaps to provide justification for demands of their own re Allied
                            access to West Berlin. They may furthermore have plans for sector/sector
                            retaliatory action, such as further limitation in number of crossing

                            increasingly adverse effect here. I reminded <persName corresp="#p_EL1"

                            that we were getting mighty tired of the recurring cycle of suspicion,

                            was due to particular circumstances “which would be overcome.” He said
                            he would inform Chancellor and his colleagues of our talk, and promised
                            he would do his best personally to ensure that a new note would be heard

                            he left Moscow that Soviet actions leading to the separate peace treaty
                            will begin soon and in time to permit recourse to the U.N. if such
                            action appears appropriate or necessary. He stated that action would be
                            initiated soon to prepare public opinion for the separate treaty, the
                            plan for which is complete. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> noted that the treaty which has been drawn up

                        <p>In what might be another Soviet misinterpretation, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> has come to the conclusion
                            that Western leaders have proven themselves so anxious to avoid conflict
                            that they will accept the treaty and accommodate themselves to it.
                            Nevertheless, he has made the observation that he will take the matter
                            to the United Nations if Western actions present to him an unacceptable
                            risk of war. In any case, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> appears to have concluded after years of
                            talking and pressuring the Allies, coupled with often brazen threats of
                            force, that he can now, with impunity, achieve his avowed purpose and
                            seal another country, including the City of Berlin, within the Communist
                            Bloc. Whether or not the West intends basically to permit this to occur,
                            it has at least permitted <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> to come to the conclusion that he can now
                            proceed with his plan. More resolute actions all along the line—often
                            avoided out of ostensible fear of precipitating conflict or even angry
                            reaction—would certainly have avoided that which appears inevitable. Our
                            diplomats and certain political appointees seem unable or unwilling to
                            accept the fact that it is impossible to negotiate politely with the
                            Soviets on an issue like Berlin. The Russians traditionally, and
                            especially the Communists more recently, understand and respond only to
                            recognized strength and willingness to apply it, and to firmly and
                            clearly stated intentions to do so in support of national policy or
                            position.</p>

                            then would permit it.</p>
                        <p>When battle group moved to Berlin in August 61 it was recognized
                            subsequent withdrawal would pose problems. Move however had definite
                            (and principally psychological) purpose which it by and large achieved.
                            Mission believes withdrawal battle group under conditions of great
                            uncertainty as to Sov intention re Berlin would be most unwise. In light
                            of past experience such move could be interpreted by important segments
                            of public and governmental opinion in West Berlin, the <gloss

                            American intentions. Danger also exists that unintentional disclosure

                        <p>Mission believes that consideration should not be given to withdrawing
                            battle group unless a reasonably long period of calm has existed in
                            Berlin, or else when something positive could be gained from withdrawal,
                            for example as forthcoming gesture in connection with settlement of the
                            Berlin issue. Fact that it may be long time before these conditions
                            exist must be accepted.</p>

                            serious proposals for alleviating tensions, suggests preparation of case
                            for public record. Such approach would be logical preliminary if <gloss

                            is likely Moscow will in fact wait as long as possible before final

                            simultaneously strengthening position in Berlin to put them in more
                            advantageous situation for later action preempting some changes inherent

                        <p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> started the
                            conversation by expressing his appreciation for Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>’s visit. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> responded by stating that Berlin
                            was today the most important place in the world; and that he was glad to
                            have this opportunity to see the Mayor just before his trip to the
                            United States. He indicated that the President very much hoped that the
                            Mayor would be able to come to Washington for a talk with the President.
                            (In a brief meeting with the press following the conference, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> confirmed that, in
                            addition to seeing the Secretary, the Mayor would also be seeing the
                            President.) Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> then
                            outlined the itinerary of his U.S. visit as follows: Saturday, Sunday,
                            and Monday (September 29 through October 1) he would be in New York,
                            conferring with the Ford Foundation on Sunday on the latter’s
                            contribution to the viability program, and on Monday with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName>; Tuesday and Wednesday
                            he would spend at Harvard for his lectures. He indicated he would come
                            to Washington on Thursday morning and would be available to see the
                            President until Friday afternoon, when he was scheduled to depart on his
                            return flight to Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> expressed the admiration
                            of the President, his Administration, and the people of the United
                            States, for the determination and intelligence with which the Berliners
                            and their Government leaders were managing their affairs under such
                            trying circumstances.</p>
                        <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0352"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> then asked the
                            Mayor what possible actions he anticipated from the <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> regime over the next few
                            months. Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> stated that
                            indications had recently been received from the East German regime that
                            some arrangements in the trade field could bring some amelioration of a
                            humanitarian nature with respect to the problem of movement of persons
                            within Berlin. On the trade side, the East was not pressing now for the
                            original credit, but seeking an agreement to increase the swing within
                            the present <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> agreement. Mayor
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> indicated that in his
                            recent discussion with the Chancellor, they had reached agreement to
                            explore this matter in a positive manner to see if the East German
                            regime was serious, and, in exchange for an increase in the <gloss
                                target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> swing, would agree to procedures to
                            bring separated families together and to permit visits to take place.
                            For this purpose they are prepared to give Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LK2">Leopold</persName> an additional authorization as a
                            negotiator to work out an agreement facilitating movement of people.</p>
                        <p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> then outlined three
                            other subjects which he had discussed with the Chancellor. The first
                            dealt with the question of a plebiscite in West Berlin. Admitting that
                            when this was first suggested a year ago the Berlin authorities had not
                            been enthusiastic from the timing point of view, he indicated that they
                            now believed a carefully tailored referendum-type plebiscite could be
                            very helpful. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> indicated
                            that they have a plebiscite law ready; and that all they need is
                            agreement on exactly the right questions to be asked. He indicated that
                            their present thinking was that the questions put to a vote should bring
                            out the unquestioning desire of the Berliners to (1) confirm once and
                            for all Berlin’s existing ties and relations to the Federal Republic,
                            and (2) the continued presence of the three Allied Powers in Berlin.
                            Elaborating on the first point, the Mayor stated it was necessary to do
                            something which would underline the fact that the links of Berlin to the
                            Federal Republic exist not because of some article in a constitution,
                            with respect to which the Allies have had to maintain reservations, but
                            as something which reflects a living and vital element of self
                            determination on the part of the West Berliners. He also indicated his
                            conviction and that of his colleagues, based on their frequent talks
                            with representatives of the important non-aligned nations, that the
                            wartime agreements, now seventeen years old, were no longer satisfactory
                            or convincing as a basis to obtain their support for the maintenance of
                            Berlin’s ties to the Federal Republic and continued presence of the
                            three Allied Powers; and that a new and convincing basis had to be
                            found. He indicated his belief that a popular referendum dealing with
                            these two questions could produce this new basis, which would be more
                            convincing from an international point of view in <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> discussions and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> indicated that the
                            second subject on which he and the Chancellor had reached agreement was
                            that of making the Wall and the <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0353"
                            />inhuman Communist actions connected therewith a matter of great
                            international confrontation. The Mayor indicated that they have received
                            what they consider to be reliable information to the effect that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> has instructed
                                <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> to be more careful
                            and to avoid creating incidents along the wall. He said he and the
                            Chancellor were agreed that pressure should be maintained on the
                                <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> regime to this end,
                            stating that as a first step the Federal Republic would soon be
                            publishing a White Book. He expressed the hope that the Allied
                            Governments would support this campaign with actions of their own.</p>
                        <p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> stated that the
                            third item of discussion, on which he and the Chancellor held different
                            views, concerned the question of whether <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> harassment of German civilian access might be expected
                            in the coming months. He reported the Chancellor as being more
                            optimistic than he, that because of the <persName corresp="#p_UW1"
                                >Ulbricht</persName> regime’s economic situation, harassing of
                            German access was unlikely. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> said that he was not convinced of this; and that
                            in his view it was an urgent matter to determine with the Allies at
                            exactly what point <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> harassment of
                            German civilian access would be considered unacceptable and what
                            specific measures would be applied to counteract such actions. He stated
                            the Germans will take on their full share of the burden; that they
                            regard this as an extremely important question; but that they were
                            genuinely concerned that the discussions so far in the Four-Power
                            Steering Group in Washington have led to the idea of invoking a policy
                            of self denial and blockade too soon. He said a blockade raises many
                            problems, especially a breakdown of Berlin industry and a severe adverse
                            popular psychological reaction which would be much more serious than in
                            1948, since Berlin had now reached a much higher standard of living. He
                            indicated his strong desire to have the Allies, in conjunction with
                            Berlin and Federal Republic officials, reach an agreement on a clear
                            definition of what the common goal would be in the event of self-denial
                            and a blockade, coupled with forthright and convincing counter-measures
                            by the Western powers to achieve this goal. He stated it was not a
                            convincing position to say that preservation of everything as it exists
                            (the status quo) is sufficient and acceptable. He said we must return to
                            demanding something new and concrete to really guarantee free German
                            access. Referring to the Jessup-Malik solution of 1949,<note n="1"

                            this was not specific or concrete enough, having dealt more with broad

                        <p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_AF2">Amrehn</persName> at this point asked
                            whether new negotiations between the President and <persName

                                corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> responded by saying there was
                            nothing new about such a meeting to his <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332"
                                facs="0354"/>knowledge and the matter rested as indicated by the
                            President in his recent press conference statement<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d122fn2">For a transcript of the President’s news conference

                            effect that if <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> comes
                            to the United States for the General Assembly, the President would be
                            willing to see him, just as he would any other head of state or prime
                            minister. If such a meeting should materialize, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> stated that what Mayor <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> had been saying would be more
                            rather than less important, especially with respect to the trade
                            negotiations and the idea of a referendum. With respect to the
                            referendum, as outlined by the Mayor, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2"
                                >Bundy</persName> indicated it would be important to have the
                            support of the free expression of the Berliners’ position on the points
                            mentioned in any future talks or negotiations with the Soviet
                            leaders.</p>
                        <p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_AF2">Amrehn</persName> stated that after the
                            U.S. elections in November, Berlin would probably face a new critical
                            situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> responded by
                            saying that the whole question of Berlin depends upon the will of the
                            Berliners. He commented that the counter-measures taken to meet the
                            Soviet harassment in the air corridors in February and March seemed to
                            have been just about right. He said it will not always be easy to
                            develop effective counter-measures; and that we must be ready to take on
                            the responsibility of effective counter-measures rapidly. Coming back to
                            the question of German access rights, Mayor Amrhen asked whether or not
                            a new codification of these rights would be ready soon. He expressed his
                            belief that the details must be nailed down. Referring to the occasional
                            arrests which occur on the autobahn, Mayor <persName corresp="#p_AF2"
                                >Amrehn</persName> stated that one of the newest harassing
                            restrictions introduced by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> on
                            the autobahn from Berlin to Hamburg was to stipulate that the trip must
                            be completed within a period of four to four and one half hours, and a
                            restriction of halting enroute to the four designated stopping places.
                            Mayor <persName corresp="#p_AF2">Amrehn</persName> insisted that a
                            definite point must be fixed beyond which all agreed the viability of
                            Berlin will be adversely affected. He added that Berlin authorities had
                            some difficulty with the word viability as being too general as a
                            concept to cover adequately the Berliners’ vital interest in access and
                            their ties to the Federal Republic.</p>
                        <p>Governing Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> then
                            referred to the difficulties of last month with respect to the death of
                            PETER FECHTER and the Soviet War Memorial Guards. He expressed the hope
                            that it was understood in the White House that there was nothing serious
                            to back up the news reports regarding a breakdown in morale and
                            confidence in the United States. He said the people were worried, to be
                            sure, but that the majority were in their factories and in their homes,
                            as normal. The demonstrations were conducted largely by young people,
                            the majority of whom hold to <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0355"
                            />the same beliefs and positions as the Mayor does, but on this occasion
                            expressed them differently than he would have. He said the main trouble
                            stemmed from a minority of bad elements among the youth. He felt he had
                            to handle the demonstrations in the way he had, with some delay in
                            introducing severe police measures, so as not to antagonize the majority
                            of the young people and turn them against him and the Allies by giving
                            them the impression that he and the city authorities were placing them
                            in the same category as the small minority of bad actors.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> stated no one in the
                            White House had the feeling that matters had gotten out of hand; that
                            there was agreement that the measures taken seemed to be adequate to
                            cope with the situation. He stressed that there was complete
                            understanding for the political problem of management involved in the
                            situation and that there was full recognition for the courage Mayor
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>’s government had
                            shown in the end. He indicated the President had full understanding for
                            the reaction of the young people and recognized that it was necessary
                            and proper for them to show their feelings under the severe
                            provocations. He concluded by stating that one must be ready in the
                            future for new incidents and be prepared to act more rapidly.</p>
                        <p>With respect to making more concrete proposals for guaranteeing
                            unhindered German civilian access, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2"
                                >Bundy</persName> agreed this was important. At the same time, he
                            said, we must all recognize that the Soviets are not interested in
                            agreeing to anything like this. He took this occasion to stress the
                            necessity for our being frank with one another. He said Berlin
                            authorities should speak up when they think actions are required; and
                            that we must be sure that we have the closest means of communication
                            between Berlin and Washington. He stated that the two most important
                            focal points were Berlin and Washington; that while one naturally had to
                            take into account the views and positions of others (the Federal
                            Republic, Paris and London), they were, in the final analysis, secondary
                            compared to having the clearest understanding between the leaders in
                            Berlin and Washington, who were the most directly involved (should a
                            serious showdown, with all its implications, occur, was implied but not
                            stated).</p>
                        <p>With respect to the plebiscite (referendum), Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> indicated this might have some
                            value, particularly if toward the end of the General Assembly the Berlin
                            question was thrown into the debate. If such a referendum were held, he
                            suggested it might be of value to have observers, such as the Indians,
                            present, and that a free expression of the West German population on the
                            questions suggested might be of some negotiation value in subsequent
                            talks by either the Secretary with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> or the President with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> asked the Mayor
                            whether he thought further actions by the <persName corresp="#p_UW1"
                                >Ulbricht</persName> regime or the Soviets would be more likely to
                                <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0356"/>come before or after
                            conclusion of a separate peace treaty. Mayor <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> expressed his belief it was
                            more likely they would come piece by piece before conclusion of a peace
                            treaty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> then inquired
                            how this might affect the timing of a plebiscite. Mayor <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said he thought it made the
                            holding of a plebiscite more urgent and that one might think of holding
                            it in November, after the American congressional elections.</p>
                        <p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> then turned to the
                            question of internal problems. He said these were not too serious; that
                            the manpower situation had achieved recently an encouraging balance; and
                            that there were slightly more people coming in than going out of Berlin,
                            the influx being predominantly of the younger generation. Senator
                            Schiller stated that the rate of investment in Berlin was slightly lower
                            than that in the Federal Republic; that there was no inflationary
                            problem; that Berlin productivity had improved; but that there was
                            presently a cautious waiting attitude obtaining with regard to new
                            investments in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> concluded by stating
                            that the decision making machinery was very important and that one could
                            not avoid feeling that it takes too long to reach decisions in order to
                            cope with serious developments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2"
                                >Bundy</persName> took this occasion to refer to the <gloss
                                target="#t_S1">S</gloss>-Bahn situation as posing a serious problem.
                            Within this context, he supported the Mayor’s action in stressing
                            publicly the importance of the three power status and rights in West
                            Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The conference was concluded by Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> passing to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2"
                                >Bundy</persName> the greetings of President Luebke and the latter’s
                            desire to meet with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> for
                            an hour or so at Wahn airport enroute to Cadenabbia, if this proved
                            feasible for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>.</p>

                        <p>The President wishes the Chancellor to know of a potentially troublesome
                            matter that has just come to his attention.</p>
                        <p>In the course of investigating the activities of registered agents acting
                            for foreign governments in the United States, the staff of a Senatorial
                            committee has come into the possession of an exchange of teletype
                            messages, dated in October 1961, between General <persName>Julius
                                Klein</persName> and Mr. <persName>Julius Epstein</persName>, who
                            was at that time in the employ of General <persName corresp="#p_KD4"
                                >Klein</persName>. In these messages, General <persName>Julius
                                Klein</persName> reported that during a conversation in the
                            Chancellor’s office he was shown three cables sent by the German
                            representatives in Washington and Paris to the Foreign Office. From the
                            teletype it appears that General <persName corresp="#p_KD4"
                                >Klein</persName>, with the excuse that he could not read German
                            rapidly, asked and received the Chancellor’s permission to take the
                            cables to his hotel for more careful study. Before returning them the
                            following morning, General <persName corresp="#p_KD4">Klein</persName>
                            had photostatic copies made for his own purposes. The teletype to
                            Epstein sets forth the text of the three cables verbatim and uncoded.
                            These cables were No. 1007 of October 5, 1961, from the German <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Delegation in Paris to the Foreign
                            Office, and Nos. 2712 and 2714 of October 8, 1961, from the Germany
                            Embassy here to Bonn.</p>
                        <p>When these teletypes came into the possession of the Senatorial
                            committee, a member of the staff of that committee realized that these
                            cables formed the basis of the articles that have recently appeared in
                            Rheinische Merkur and Der Spiegel. These articles were written by the
                            same Julius Epstein to whom the teletypes were addressed. Epstein is no
                            longer in General <persName corresp="#p_KD4">Klein</persName>’s
                            employment.</p>
                        <p>The cables contain a detailed account of discussions between the Four
                            Powers following the President’s conversation with Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. This account is
                            reproduced almost word for word in the articles, although with a greatly
                            distorted emphasis.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the staff of a Congressional committee now know
                            the source of these articles, the Chancellor’s relations to the whole
                            story may become public at any time. As is well known, the U.S.
                            President cannot control the actions of the legislative branch. Further,
                            so many people are involved in the proceedings of the committee that the
                            risk of public disclosure is great.</p>
                        <p>The President, of course, is concerned that, in the event of a public
                            disclosure, the matter should be handled on this side in such a way as
                            to <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0358"/>minimize its effects. He
                            will do what he can, and would appreciate having by a private channel,
                            if possible, any suggestions on this.</p>
                        <p>The President regrets that the Chancellor should be troubled by such
                            matters at a time when together the Chancellor and he are carrying such
                            a heavy burden of world problems.<note n="1" xml:id="d123fn1">On

                            the Berlin situation, in military terms, was the most severe since

                        <p>I believe that you, Mr. President, like me realize that until a
                            reasonable solution is reached on West Berlin this source will always
                            make our relations feverish. And under present circumstances we do not
                            see any other way out but to sign a German peace treaty. On this basis
                            it would be possible with no loss to the prestige of either side to
                            solve the problem of West Berlin too, to guarantee, as you say, the
                            freedom of the population of West Berlin by stationing there for some
                            not very long time a certain number of symbolic troops under the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> flag. It would seem, what can be more
                            reasonable, if there is a desire to actually reach an agreement and
                            eliminate the hot-beds that from time to time make our relations
                            feverish and sometimes bring them to the red-hot glow.</p>
                        <p>If there is somebody who is interested in preserving those hot-beds then
                            such interest stems from nothing else but a desire to prevent by all
                            means the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the
                            U.S. And I say straightforwardly that it is, of course, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> who is interested in that in
                            the first place. By no means is he motivated by good intentions. The
                            Hitlerite Germany lost the war with all the ensuing consequences. Its
                            plans to expand “lebensraum” at the expense of other states ended in
                            failure. This should be recognized once and for all. In fact, that is
                            what the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and other
                            countries fought for against the Hitlerite Germany. Why then should you
                            and we now reckon with the revanchist strivings of the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and even encourage them delaying
                            indefinitely the conclusion of a German peace treaty and preserving the
                            present indefinite situation, fraught with danger? After all it is the
                            absence of a peace treaty that feeds the hopes of aggressive revanchist
                            circles in West Germany for a possibility to revise the results of World
                            War II.</p>
                        <p>Now in all countries there are more and more people who think of and are
                            concerned with the destinies of the world and who seek not to let it
                            escalate to war. They more and more clearly understand that it is
                            impossible to postpone any further the conclusion of a German peace
                            treaty and to preserve the present dangerous situation.</p>
                        <p>During my conversations on all those questions with your Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> I told him that we

                            things that sow danger of world war. In order not to play in such

                            problem, so to say, on ice until the end of the elections. We had in
                            mind that after elections we would resume the dialogue. We were under
                            the impression that we would meet an understanding on the part of the
                            American side, all the more that on many questions relating to German
                            peace settlement a certain rapprochement of our positions has already
                            been achieved that gives hope for a possibility of an agreement.</p>
                        <p>The only question on which the difference between us still remains is, as
                            we believe, that of the presence of foreign troops in West Berlin. And
                            even not the question of the presence of troops as such because on that
                            we have already made a step in your direction, but only the question—the
                            troops of what countries will be stationed there. You insist that the
                            occupation troops of the U.S., Britain and France continue to stay in
                            West Berlin. But that would not normalize the situation even after the
                            signing of a peace treaty because the main source of friction between
                            our countries—the use of West Berlin under the cover of occupation
                            regime as a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base—would remain
                            unremoved. That is why we considered and continue to consider that the
                            best thing under the circumstances would be to station in West Berlin
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops. To stabilize the situation
                            in Europe it would be also reasonable to have both German states—the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss>—admitted to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, so
                            that they normalize at last relations between each other and with other
                            states—members of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Such is our position. I stated it in detail to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> who, evidently, informed you
                            about it.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow 6 pages on Cuba and a <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-2
                            flight over Sakhalin.]</p>
                        <p>Therefore I would ask you to correctly understand our anxiety and not to
                            do anything that could further aggravate the atmosphere and even explode
                            the world. We on our part again say to you that we will do nothing with
                            regard to West Berlin until the elections in the U.S. After the
                            elections, apparently in the second half of November, it would be
                            necessary in our opinion to continue the dialogue. Of great importance
                            for finding the ways to solve both this problem and other pressing
                            international problems are personal contacts of statesmen on the highest
                            level. I think that if we, persons entrusted with great confidence and
                            bearing enormous responsibility, constantly feel this responsibility, we
                            will have to come to the realization of the necessity of reaching an
                            agreement on West Berlin to eliminate this dangerous hot-bed which
                            spoils our relations all the time.</p>

                            15 minutes. Practically entire discussion centered on Berlin.</p>
                        <p>In response to Sec’s question <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> expressed thought that morale was not too bad in
                            Berlin. Referring to Aug. riots and to criticism of Western powers
                            published by some newspapers, Mayor said this was partly due to
                            misunderstanding of what four-power status is, i.e. difference between
                            four-power status based on agreements in regard to all Berlin and
                            three-power commitments to West Berlin. This was not clear enough to
                            Berlin and German people. It was not clear to them that sector wall was
                            limit to guarantees.</p>
                        <p>In response Sec said in reality limit is what has come to be power to
                            act. Assertion four-power rights can become very important, for
                            instance, if Berlin question introduced into <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. We cannot accept talking solely about West Berlin and
                            this we have always emphasized in our talks with <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. True, steps were taken in 1948
                            and 1955 which removed any effective Western voice in happenings in east
                            Berlin and east Germany.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said he would like to
                            discuss: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Morale in city, and</item>

                        <p>Morale in city would be immensely helped if it would be possible to reach
                            some arrangements with east Germans to counteract most inhumane aspects
                            of wall. He had had 4-hour talk last week with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> and they had just had new
                            information from east Germans in discussing trade that perhaps they
                            would be willing to discuss “other things” though they denied any
                            connection or relation to trade east Germans inferred they had approval
                            of “great ally”. This discussion on trade did not involve credits as
                            previously proposed but larger swing in existing trade. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> favors extension greater swing
                            and this will be discussed through <persName corresp="#p_LK2"
                                >Leopold</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_BH9">Behrendt</persName>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> expressed hope “other
                            things” which east Germans might concede would be permission unite or
                            bring closer divided families (a subject already being discussed through
                            the Red Cross), permission for older people to join families even though
                            not bound by closest blood relationship and finally permission West
                            Berliners visit their relatives in east Berlin. There was another idea
                            which West Berliners had discussed among themselves, namely proposal to
                            establish visiting centers where relatives might visit for two or three
                            hours at a time. Such centers might be established on sector border or
                            in exclaves. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> apparently
                            does not favor this idea referring to this as “prison conditions”. He
                            does not expect very much out of this but said possible church leaders
                            in east Germany could maintain some links with West.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_LK2">Leopold</persName> would be authorized discuss
                            greater swing balance by letter from <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Erhard</persName> and “other things” such as movement of people by
                            letter from <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> and perhaps
                            letter from <persName corresp="#p_GH2">Globke</persName> authorizing
                            talks on all technical matters. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> said this was delicate matter and would be
                            skating on thin ice but Chancellor knows about this. Sec commented that
                            if by using this channel easements of this sort could be worked out, it
                            should be tried even though it will not solve main problem.</p>
                        <p>Turning to plebiscite, <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>
                            said when <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> had brought up
                            this idea in past, he had not favored it expressed opinion it might be
                            useful rather soon have word from West Berliners. It would be good for
                            psychological reasons to have West Berliners expressing their own views
                            instead of others expressing views on their behalf. He had mentioned
                            this to <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName><note n="2"
                                xml:id="d126fn2">See <ref target="#d122">Document 122</ref>.</note>
                            and also to the three Deputy Commandants. Could propose referendum for
                            whole Berlin which, if refused, could be applied in West Berlin
                            requesting vote on (a) continued Allied presence and (b) maintainance
                            existing links with Bonn. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>
                            thought plebiscite on these questions could play important role
                            politically and morally.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said he agreed in one respect, i.e., if Berlin question comes
                            before <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or if there is harsh
                            confrontation with Soviets, one of our strongest points would be to say
                            “ask the people involved.” When this idea had first been talked about
                            between the President and <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                            >Adenauer</persName>, there had been newspaper leaks and it was deemed
                            not advisable to proceed. However, timing was important question.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> may or may not
                            come in November. Question whether vote might be held before he comes or
                            later will need careful consideration. In short, the question was when
                            do you play this card. In response to Secretary’s question, <pb n="341"
                                xml:id="pg_341" facs="0363"/><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> said they would need three weeks after decision
                            taken to hold plebiscite, actually to carry out vote.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> then said he would like to
                            touch on another idea. The Russians have been talking much about Berlin
                            as a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base and asserting that Bonn
                            cannot have any say in West Berlin. He wanted to ask whether we could go
                            back to the 1955 agreements on <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                            independence and examine again annexes how <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> relations with West Berlin could be defined.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d126fn3">For text of these agreements, signed at Paris

                                ff.</note> The Secretary remarked that we would have to look into
                            this in detail before he could comment. (Sec suggests Dept. officers may
                            wish discuss this point in more detail with <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> when he visits Washington toward end week.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary said he wanted to make one point in regard to Allied vs.
                            civilian access to West Berlin. While we do not see in existing
                            agreements clear rights for civilian access, we have insisted in all our
                            talks with Soviets that civilian access goes hand in hand with our own
                            rights for access. Although there is perhaps theoretical difference, we
                            have supposed that in certain circumstances we should have to
                            incorporate civilian traffic into ours as exercise of our full rights.
                            We cannot accept shut-off or close-down of civilian traffic.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> observed difficulty was
                            people do not have clear definition of what is meant by three points
                            Western vital interests: Allied presence, access to Berlin and
                            viability. Asked whether we could not put down on paper clear definition
                            of what is meant by these three points. Cited difficulties arising if
                            east Germans suddenly introduced visa requirement and pointed out they
                            could do this in various ways by which many people in Germany or outside
                            would not really understand import. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> had impression four-power group in Washington had
                            been “going too fast” on ground access measures while relying more on
                            air access. Thought it perhaps not good to talk too much on
                            countermeasures.</p>
                        <p>Sec expressed thought that principal support for expanded civil access to
                            Berlin lies in self-interest of other side in trade agreements.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> thought this was true
                            only to certain degree since if <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> made a political decision to go ahead then he
                            would have already taken into account economic countermeasures. Sec
                            remarked <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had other
                            things to worry about too. Soviet bloc has annual trade of four and half
                            billion with <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OeCD</gloss> countries. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> has said to recent visitors
                            that after signing peace treaty he would cut off military access. If he
                            does there would be “roaring crisis” but it is possible Soviets first
                            target will be military access.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> raised question whether
                            West has given sufficient answer to Soviets at this session <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. He agreed we must not do anything to
                            bring <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> into the question at this time.
                            But many friends from non-aligned countries had asked what they could do
                            for West Berlin, for instance, Malayans on recent visit asked what they
                            might do for <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> in New York.
                            Sec said he would like to state in extreme confidence that <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> relation to Berlin problem was point of
                            difference between US, French and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.
                            When it was question involving US in war, our policy was to give great
                            deal of attention to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is one reason why we are not
                            isolationists. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> had allergy to <gloss

                            though under certain contingencies there was general agreement we would
                            go to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Sec again emphasized
                            confidential nature his comments.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> stated <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> attitude toward America much
                            better than even month ago. Sec added our principal burden is
                            psychological. Some people seem think that unless we repeat every month
                            our assurances, they lose meaning. On the other hand, we believe
                            constant repetition inflates words and they become cheap. Sec
                            complimented <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> on response
                            to press inquiry he had not come to obtain additional assurances, “we
                            don’t need assurances.” This was best thing <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> could have said.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> asked whether in future
                            talks with Soviets we might consider proposing talks at Ambassadorial
                            level in Bonn between three Western Ambassadors and Soviet colleague.
                            Soviet officials on cocktail circuit in Berlin had inferred this might
                            be acceptable idea. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> added
                            that at some point experts from east and West Germany could join in
                            discussion technical matters. Sec said he would be glad to look into
                            this idea. If there were a meeting between President and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> this suggestion might help
                            save <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s prestige.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> then referred to his
                            forthcoming lectures at Harvard which would be mainly concerned with
                            european integration. He would say something on Berlin and since one or
                            two things might be critical he would like to tell the Sec beforehand.
                            He would make point welfare Berlin was more important than wall and
                            hence in present circumstances they could not encourage disturbances or
                            revolt in east Germany. However, there was one exception, if there were
                            military attack against West Berlin he could not ask east Germans to
                            remain quiet. Sec agreed.</p>
                        <p>In subsequent discussion whether east German Armed Forces reliable and
                            would fight against Western forces or against <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> forces, question arose re contingency planning for
                            actions to be taken in east Germany if and when access was blocked. (Sec
                            asked Department consider possibility briefing <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> more fully on contingency
                            planning this point.)</p>
                        <p>Info Officer <persName corresp="#p_BE5">Bahr</persName> remarked
                            difficult understand when access problem would arise, for instance,
                            would it be when passports or visas required. <pb n="343"
                                xml:id="pg_343" facs="0365"/>Sec said <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> must think more about this question of recognition.
                            When we had proposed international access authority, there was sharp
                            reaction from Bonn. We resented this reaction since we were least
                            involved when 11 <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members have east
                            German trade missions in their countries. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> commented he did not know what de facto
                            recognition is though he knows there are certain de facto relations. Sec
                            said we would not extend de jure recognition to east Germany. But we do
                            not wish attempt define de facto recognition which means nothing in law.
                            Furthermore there are certain advantages in not trying to define this
                            point. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> referred back to
                            his idea having Ambassadors meet in Bonn and at certain point bring in
                            German experts. Wondered whether <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> might tell <persName corresp="#p_UW1"
                                >Ulbricht</persName> keep quiet and consider this recognition. Sec
                            said two things bear on this, 1) astonishing failure of east Germany,
                            and 2) speaking entirely frankly, free Germans have not yet developed
                            proper confidence in themselves. The great gravitational force is to the
                            West. He was not suggesting new policy but thought more channels could
                            be opened up and it would be possible to achieve more. Important that
                            barriers do not come from our side.</p>

                            Chancellor had told him he was in favor of a plebiscite and of
                            bargaining with the east Germans to improve conditions for human

                            help Berlin morale, but its wording must be considered carefully. The
                            Chancellor also reported that the east Germans had already made a
                            proposal on the question of contacts. (Memorandum for the President;

                                >Brandt</persName> responded that at present it was good. Morale had
                            recovered from the blow of the wall. The economy was in fairly good
                            shape although perhaps not as well as it could be. He expected that in
                            the near future some pressures would be exercised on access routes but
                            it was difficult to forecast how.</p>
                        <p>The President raised the question of what we were prepared to do to
                            maintain civilian access to West Berlin if the east Germans got control
                            of the access routes. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>
                            said he saw the problem in terms of how to respond in such a way as not
                            to interfere with the viability of Berlin. He thought that many of the
                            countermeasures we now contemplated were deficient on two counts. They
                            were ineffective as a means of pressure on the Soviet Union, and they
                            were bad for West Berlin’s economy. While we had to defend the principle
                            of free access if possible, we had to pay some attention to the
                            realities of the situation. The President asked if Mayor <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> thought it was wise for us to
                            blockade ourselves if the east Germans asked for visas. Mayor <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> responded he would, of course,
                            prefer not to accept visas, but if the choice was presented he <pb
                                n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0367"/>would prefer to maintain access
                            rather than resort to countermeasures. He suggested it would be possible
                            to get a German traffic agency which corresponded to the <gloss
                                target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> and operated at the same practical
                            level. Perhaps the agency could in some way be combined with the Office
                            for Interzonal Trade. In response to the President’s questions on how
                                <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> now functions, the Mayor
                            explained that the two negotiators were located in east and West Berlin
                            and visited each other regularly. Special papers provided for their free
                            access across the wall.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President’s question of what papers were involved in
                            visits to the Leipzig Fair, Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> answered that West Germans show a passport or
                            identity card, together with a letter from the east German authorities
                            giving permission to go to the Fair.</p>
                        <p>The President returned to the question of whether we could get an
                            arrangement on civilian access connected with and corresponding to the
                            arrangement on <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss>. Mayor <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> responded that this was a
                            matter which should be explored urgently now, rather than waiting for
                            the signature of a treaty. The President remarked that, of course, east
                            Germany will ask for the greatest degree of recognition in connection
                            with any such arrangement, and Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> added that they will also ask for a larger volume
                            of trade. The President expressed his view that West Berlin and West
                            Germany should discuss this matter, come to an agreement, and take the
                            lead in developing concrete proposals. He recited the history of our
                            proposals on an international access authority and the German reaction
                            thereto. Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> expressed
                            agreement with the President’s view on the desirability of German
                            initiative in this matter.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> remarked
                            that we, of course, could not predict what form pressure on access would
                            take; that it was obvious that the Soviets regarded military access as
                            more important—perhaps they would start with it. The President responded
                            by stating that military access was our problem; that we would move to
                            an airlift and if this were interfered with, it would mean war.</p>
                        <p>He then returned to the problem of civilian trade and asked for a German
                            initiative before the event. Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> commented that speaking for himself and his
                            colleagues in the Berlin Senate, he would consider it deplorable if the
                            idea of an international access authority is dead. It is better to deal
                            with <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> as one of thirteen
                            than as one of two. The Mayor said it was his own impression that
                            something could be done on this basis and yet we could still preserve
                            the formal theory of Soviet-Allied control.</p>
                        <p>The Mayor then raised the question of the desirability of 4-Power
                            discussions in Bonn among the ambassadors of the Soviet Union, U.S.,
                            U.K., and France. He thought this would be a useful channel now that the
                            Soviet commandant had disappeared from Berlin. Perhaps the 4 Powers in
                            Bonn could agree to instruct German experts to work out a <pb n="346"
                                xml:id="pg_346" facs="0368"/>trade and access agreement. The
                            President commented that this would be good if the Soviets in fact
                            wished to lessen tension. At present, unfortunately, there was no
                            evidence this was so. All our talks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> suggested just the opposite. The Soviets
                            continue to raise the issue of troops which we have stated repeatedly is
                            not negotiable.</p>
                        <p>The President returned again to the issue of civilian land traffic and
                            some degree of acceptance of east German presence. He repeated his
                            comments on the misunderstandings that had arisen in Bonn on our
                            previous proposals and the desirability, accordingly, of a German
                            initiative. He asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1"
                                >Hillenbrand</persName> to comment on this point. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName> distinguished between the
                            German and Allied views on this question and pointed out there were some
                            technical problems of German passport law which stood in the way of a
                            denial policy at the moment. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1"
                                >Knappstein</persName> observed that if the Federal Republic
                            accepted east German visas this would give the east Germans the
                            opportunity to practice selective exclusion against visitors to Berlin.
                            The President responded that they have that power now and they can
                            always do it. We, in turn, can counter by using the air route. The
                            really difficult problem was goods, and not people: people can fly;
                            goods must go by rail, truck or canal. The President reiterated his view
                            that it was much more advantageous for us to take the initiative
                            immediately, than to be put in the position of responding once the
                            Soviets had signed a peace treaty with east Germany. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> remarked how
                            difficult it was to plan ahead on these matters.</p>
                        <p>The President then raised the question of a plebiscite in West Germany.
                            He said he favored a plebiscite and the important problem was one of
                            timing. Should we do it immediately or should we wait until <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> appeared at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and then respond to his actions there in
                            this way? Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said that
                            he himself wanted it as soon as possible, which would be a minimum of
                            three weeks from the day the decision was taken. Unfortunately, a Berlin
                            paper (Tagesspiegel) had benefited from a leak on this story and it was
                            now a matter of public discussion. Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> emphasized the advantages of a plebiscite for the
                            Berliners themselves as a morale builder and argued this as a ground for
                            rapid action. The President pointed out that the other side of the
                            argument was, of course, the desirability of being able to respond to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. Mayor <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said in that case, we might
                            propose an all-Berlin plebiscite to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> and after he rejected it, have one in West
                            Berlin. This course would have the difficulty that the questions raised
                            in West Berlin would be different than those asked in east Berlin. The
                            central questions are the presence of Allied troops and links to the
                            Federal Republic. Neither of these is exactly appropriate to ask in east
                            Berlin. The President said that this was a problem that required more
                            thought. He wanted both sides to think about the timing and come to a
                            conclusion <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0369"/>as quickly as
                            possible. Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> observed
                            that this would be difficult with the Quadripartite planning machinery.
                            The President thought that agreement should be reached between the
                            Federal Republic and West Berlin, there should then be a discussion
                            between them and the U.S. and on this basis a decision should be taken.
                            Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said that 15
                            December was the last date on which it would be useful to hold a
                            plebiscite this year. It was hard to have it in the Christmas season.
                            The President agreed and called for an early decision.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>
                            his evaluation of our contingency plans in relation to the difficulties
                            that he, <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>, expected in the
                            near future. The Mayor responded that, while he expected some
                            interference, it was difficult to predict the kind of interference and
                            that he found it hard to respond to the President’s question.</p>
                        <p>The President turned to east Germany and the state of its army and
                            economy. Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said he
                            thought the army was not too reliable, but that properly deployed with
                            Russian troops stiffening them, they would fight. They would probably
                            fight Americans better than West Germans. In response to a question by
                            the President, Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>
                            stated east Germany would never be able to defend itself without support
                            from the Soviet Union no matter how the Soviets armed it, and the
                            Soviets would not rely on it to do so. He said the east German economy
                            was not significantly worse than it was last year but it certainly was
                            no better. There had been a serious psychological deterioration since
                            the building of the wall.</p>
                        <p>The President commented on two defects in our contingency plans. First,
                            they proved not to provide for important contingencies, e.g., the wall.
                            Second, there was a lack of political commitment. He was especially
                            critical of the lack of political commitment on the military contingency
                            plans. He then went on to remark that we had made our commitments to
                            Berlin clear in terms of our increase in military strength and
                            expenditures. The contrast with the French and even the Germans was
                            clear. Unless we built up our conventional strength, our nuclear power
                            would not really deter. It would be hard for the Russians to believe
                            that we would pause for 60 days of mobilization and then begin a nuclear
                            war. The geography of Berlin was such that the disadvantage lay with us
                            because it was we who would have to make the first military move. This
                            detracted from the credibility of our threat of nuclear war and made
                            necessary readiness to use our conventional forces.</p>
                        <p>The President then summarized the discussion as follows: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Berlin was a key American commitment. Our actions were our
                                    assurances. If it were not for Berlin we could feel free to take
                                    action in Cuba. He thanked Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                        >Brandt</persName> for his airport statement in which
                                        <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> had said that
                                    it was unnecessary for him to ask us for assurances.</item>
                                <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0370"/>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>It was important to make every attempt at a peaceful solution.
                                    If we did not we would defeat our own aims because we would fail

                                    the support of West Berlin, but opposition from the French and
                                    some opposition from Bonn. It is clear that at the moment the

                            leads to the status quo minus. We had to act. The President agreed and

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> denied Soviet Government
                            under impression US speaking only for <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> and had no position of its own, but claimed
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>’s extremist position
                            influenced US position, which evidenced by chain of facts relevant to
                            substance US–USSR talks in Geneva and earlier in New York. Re <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>’s efforts decrease tensions, claimed no
                            evidence to that effect so far. Reiterated standard Soviet argument re
                            existence two independent German states and that Soviet position based
                            on that fact. Stated US–USSR talks so far had produced narrowing of gap
                            on some points but there are still obstacles on road toward agreement.
                            Asserted US–USSR’s first preference still to reach agreed solution and
                            said that if US doesn’t wish sign peace treaty with <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, then agreement could be reached on
                            status West Berlin, presence Western forces West Berlin, and access to
                            West Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thought that
                            if West unwilling reach agreement on these points, the time approaching
                            when one should take stock of situation to see where both sides stood
                            emphasized question of peace settlement with Germany not one of prestige
                            but rather of peace in europe.</p>
                        <p>Secretary recalled Soviet statements that unification should be left to
                            Germans themselves, noted that difficulty was Soviets apparently meant
                            it was up to <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> rather than
                            German people as such, stressed importance of not closing door on
                            unification by what we say or do and pointed to dangers that might
                            emanate in time from divided Germany. Secretary stated our first choice
                            is peace treaty with one unified Germany, but since there is no
                            agreement as to how World War II should be ended legally, we had to look
                            at factual situation, which includes two parts of Germany and Western
                            presence in Berlin as third fact to be fully taken into account.
                            Provided this done arrangement could be reached.</p>
                        <p>Re US–USSR exchanges so far, Secretary deplored lack of reciprocity on
                            Soviet part and noted that the more we tried to close gap the more USSR
                            backed away and attempted put pressure on us to move where we could not
                            do so.</p>
                        <p>After Secretary had reviewed US positions on such matters as status West
                            Berlin and presence Western forces West Berlin, he referred to <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s remark re taking stock of
                            situation and emphasized US prepared sit down and analyze situation at
                            any time. Noted no need wait for US elections.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then reiterated along
                            well-known lines Soviet position re revanchism in West Germany, and
                            respect for sovereignty <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Re <pb
                                n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0372"/>stock-taking, stated he meant
                            no bookkeeping operation but rather political analysis respective
                            positions two sides and drawing appropriate conclusions. Stressed main
                            problem now, which would influence settlement of entire set of
                            questions, was presence Western forces West Berlin. Reiterated Soviet
                            position on that issue and Soviet argument re <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> bases West Berlin. Denied USSR had retreated from
                            points of rapprochement achieved so far.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then summarized Soviet
                            analysis situation as follows essential elements German peace settlement
                            are: (1) Recognition German borders; (2) <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact non-aggression pact; (3) Non-armament
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> with nuclear weapons; (4) Cessation subversive
                            activities West Berlin against <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>; and
                            (5) Complete respect for <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            sovereignty. Asserted USSR would use all its prestige and influence to
                            ensure with Western powers or with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            free and uninterrupted access to West Berlin by land, water and air and
                            noted there were other, minor questions to be resolved such as
                            non-introduction nuclear weapons to West Berlin, transit and customs
                            arrangements, et cetera, but reiterated main stumbling block is US
                            insistence on perpetuation stationing Western forces and occupation
                            status West Berlin. Concluded by saying he had expounded Soviet position
                            again on behalf Soviet Government and <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> in hope it would meet with understanding on
                            part US Government and that both sides would be able move forward on
                            that basis. Said USSR would deeply regret if it had to act without US or
                            its allies. Noted Secretary’s remark that there is no need wait for US
                            elections and stated USSR always prepared exchange views if warranted by
                            situation.</p>

                            at Soviet proposal since it could perhaps accommodate <persName

                        <p>Secretary pointed out <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                            use of term revanchist appeared indicate all Germans who sought
                            unification their country were revanchists. Refuted claim Berlin <gloss

                            were there for political and not military purpose. Stressed fact all

                            undermining Western presence West Berlin and changing character West
                            Berlin. Re Home’s reference to access authority, Secretary stated it was
                            application of idea discussed sometime ago. Soviet suggestion for
                            arbitral <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0373"/>body had not led to
                            detailed discussion because question very quickly arose to what kind of
                            city access would lead. If understanding were reached on that question,
                            then technical problems would be easier to resolve. Secretary wondered
                            how Soviets could expect West rely on fresh agreements at very time they
                            wished break existing agreements. Questioned value suggestion for
                            non-aggression pact between <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                            Warsaw at very time when Soviets applying aggressive pressure with
                            respect West Berlin. Soviets asking for confidence at very time they
                            destroying confidence in existing arrangements. Secretary concluded he
                            would report conversation to President and we would study it very
                            carefully to see whether anything opened up. Stressed, however, we could
                            not leave West Berlin so on that point we were back to Vienna.</p>

                            discussion latter question useful, but agreed it ran into main question
                            of to what access would lead. Reiterated suggestion US take another look
                            at Soviet proposal for arbitration organ and noted that proposal could
                            perhaps be discussed again at later date.</p>
                        <p>Secretary stated we would review carefully problem of access. Believed
                            access as such not impossible to resolve, but pointed out main question
                            would still remain.</p>

                        <p>The President asked the Foreign Minister for his judgment on the
                            situation. He replied that the Soviets seemed not to have made up their
                            minds as to what they would do. The Wall had settled the physical
                            problem of the flow of refugees from east to West. What was now left was
                            largely a question of prestige. He thought the Russians would have to do
                            something one day. The question was how much risk they were prepared to
                            take. He thought they were prepared to take some risk but not a major
                            risk leading to war. He thought <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> would want to pull off something like a
                            treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to show that he had
                            brought about a change in the situation from what had existed
                            previously. He thought it not unlikely that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> would come to New York under cover of the
                            General Assembly in order to talk over Berlin with the President.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if Berlin had been discussed between <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> during the recent German visit.
                            The Foreign Minister said the subject had been mentioned but not really
                            discussed.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was worried about the slowness of measures foreseen
                            under our contingency planning and the time needed for a military probe
                            to be carried out. According to present plans, four days would be
                            required to put our troops onto the Autobahn. He felt we should have
                            improved planning not only in the area of possible contingencies, but
                            with regard to the centralization of responsibilities in Berlin. He
                            thought that the idea of a 60-day pause for mobilization was
                            unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister agreed that the contingency planning was not very
                            realistic. He felt it had been in a direction contrary to what should
                            have been done. He said our present position was to probe the Soviets
                            although we knew what the result was going to be. Then we would get
                            stuck and we would then merely think the situation over. He felt that if
                            something were to be done at all, it should be immediate. He said that
                            in 1948 we had been able to carry out an airlift while accepting ground
                            blockade because the Soviets did not then have nuclear weapons. This
                            time if ground access were cut, we would run the risk of being dragged
                            into war. He thought that our present posture was ineffectual, and
                            potentially more dangerous than something more incisive would be.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said our planning had been conducted on a basis of Allied
                            forces in being. If the West had had more forces under <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, we would have had more choice.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister referred to the reoccupation of the Rhineland by
                            Hitler in 1936, when France didn’t move because of the restraining
                            influence of her military advisers. He felt that military advice does
                            not sufficiently take into account essential political factors. He felt
                            we should not wait and think things over while the Russians were
                            mobilizing. It may well be that the Russians feel we are putting on a
                            show to try <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0375"/>to impress them,
                            but that they would not be persuaded by this that we mean what we say.
                            The President said we ought to have forces ready to go within one or two
                            hours on the Autobahn.</p>
                        <p>Commenting on the small number of French troops on German soil, the
                            Foreign Minister explained that he thought it was a little risky to have
                            such a large concentration of troops in Germany itself and that there
                            might be some advantage for them to be deployed in greater depth. At
                            this point the Foreign Minister sought to buttress this view by
                            referring vaguely to views which he claimed General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName> had expressed to him in the
                            same sense. However when the President commented that he thought he was
                            familiar with General <persName corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName>’s
                            views and that he had always been in favor of forward strategy, the
                            Foreign Minister did not comment further.</p>
                        <p>The President read from and discussed a report by General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> on the time required to move
                            troops in the event of crisis.<note n="1" xml:id="d130fn1">The President
                                is referring to CM–7–62, October 6, which, inter alia, provided an
                                analysis of the actions necessary to put the West in position to
                                launch a battalion-sized probe on the Berlin Autobahn. (Washington
                                National Records Center, RG 330, OSD Files: FRC 66 B 3542, 091
                                Germany)</note> The Foreign Minister said it was evident that the
                            time envisaged was much too long and that we should react within 24
                            hours. He said if ground access was cut, the West needed to move
                            immediately on (1) economic and other measures in the field of blockade
                            and (2) sending a small unit onto the Autobahn within 24 hours. He said
                            it should not be difficult to keep a few hundred men on an alert basis.
                            They need not be massed on the Brunswick airfield but should be in a
                            position to be rapidly transported to the checkpoint. The President
                            commented that point 2 above was more important and urgent than point
                            1.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> commented that
                            one trouble was that governments were unwilling to commit themselves and
                            to delegate authority for action ahead of events, except for matters
                            relating to air access which was a simpler problem. Thus governments had
                            to react and take decisions after the events with which they were
                            confronted.</p>
                        <p>The President said that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            was probably counting on a slow reaction from the West. The President
                            thought he might write a letter to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> setting down some of the things that were
                            bothering him with regard to our present contingency planning, and see
                            whether perhaps General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            would favor the idea of trying to obtain certain advance commitments by
                            governments. The Foreign Minister said he thought this would be
                            useful.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister reverted to the subject of the two French divisions
                            under <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and said he could see that
                            the President was interested and even worried about this matter. He
                            exposed at some length <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0376"/>the
                            political reasons why it was desirable to keep French troops on French
                            soil. Twenty years had passed since the French Army had been stationed
                            in France. It had lost contact with the people of the country and this
                            had caused serious trouble. It was necessary to readjust the
                            relationship between French forces and the French population. If they
                            were on German soil, they would still be in a foreign country and out of
                            touch with domestic sentiment (the Foreign Minister stressed the
                            sensitivity of what he had just said, adding that this was something
                            which General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would
                            never tell the President himself).</p>
                        <p>The Secretary wondered what interpretation <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> would place on the absence of French troops
                            from German soil.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he didn’t wish the President to believe that
                            France was relying on the US nuclear capability as an excuse for not
                            doing her conventional share. He said the problem was to try to prevent
                            misunderstanding on the part of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President said that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            had not moved to seize Berlin militarily because he knew what this would
                            entail but we had a real problem with regard to ground access. He asked
                            for the Foreign Minister’s view as to what we should do on the ground
                            after we found our access blocked.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said things would move fast either we would begin to
                            talk right away or there would be war.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked the Foreign Minister whether he would favor talking
                            at this point. The Foreign Minister’s reply was unclear and generally
                            evasive.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> suggested that
                            consideration be given to a Four Power communication to the Soviet
                            Union, which would include the Germans.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to the points which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> had made to the Secretary in their
                                conversation<note n="2" xml:id="d130fn2">See <ref target="#d129"
                                    >Document 129</ref>.</note> in relation to the withdrawal of
                            troops. He said <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would
                            have to drop his insistence on this point. This was not a matter which
                            could be negotiated.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we were taking an urgent and searching look at the
                            whole access question. He thought there was a possibility of the Soviets
                            dropping the troops issue. He thought study should be given to the
                            possibility of some variant of the Soviet arbitral commission.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> would not wage war over Berlin. What he was
                            doing was asking us to quit. The Foreign Minister thought that there
                            might be the danger of a new uprising in east Germany, as had happened
                            in 1953.</p>
                        <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0377"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> felt we
                            had underestimated the potential role of the east Germans.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that a crisis would not last long, but would
                            come to a head rapidly.</p>
                        <p>The President said that as a result of the Soviet actions on Cuba, there
                            was much less prospect of reaching agreement on Berlin. Thus <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> might try to force
                            something. He asked the Foreign Minister what the French would do if the
                            Soviets were to cut access on the ground. The Foreign Minister replied
                            that if this were to happen both in the air and on the ground, we should
                            begin by taking appropriate action in the air. He said that if they were
                            to cut both military and civilian traffic on the ground, we should use
                            force and go ahead with the probe. If only military traffic on the
                            ground were cut off, we should consider whether it was necessary to use
                            force ourselves by undertaking a probe, because air access could be used
                            for supplying the military garrisons.</p>
                        <p>The President pressed the Foreign Minister again and asked if his thought
                            was that if military traffic on the ground were cut off, we should not
                            have recourse to a military probe. The Foreign Minister’s answer was
                            evasive.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> called on
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> this afternoon at his
                            own request. He said he had not come to make a demarche but to consult
                            on a matter which “worries me a little”. In Mayor <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>’s talk with <pb n="356"
                                xml:id="pg_356" facs="0378"/>the President on October 5, 1962<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d131fn1">See <ref target="#d128">Document
                                128</ref>.</note> the latter had made several statements which
                            “worried us” since it appeared that possibly they had been made on the
                            basis of incomplete information. These statements were that thus far all
                            United States proposals for a solution of the problem of civilian access
                            to Berlin had been rejected by either Moscow or Bonn, that the United
                            States would make no more proposals on this subject, and that it was now
                            up to the West Berliners and West Germans to get together and make their
                            own proposals for a solution.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said he felt that some
                            of these statements were not entirely supported by the facts. He was
                            also bothered by recent newspaper articles reporting a shift in the West
                            German attitude toward the proposal for an International Access
                            Authority. These reports gave the wrong impression that the Germans have
                            been opposed to this proposal. In fact, however, Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> had told Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> last June in Bonn<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d131fn2">See <ref target="#d68fn2">footnote 2,
                                    Document 68</ref>.</note> that the Federal Republic was in basic
                            agreement with the United States draft regarding the composition of the
                            Governing Board for an Access Authority. <persName corresp="#p_KHK1"
                                >Knappstein</persName> said he considered it important to clear the
                            matter up before Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> arrived in the United States. He was most
                            anxious to do away with “these little misunderstandings”. He, therefore,
                            wished to consult us on whether it would not be advisable for the German
                            embassy to issue a public statement to the press setting forth the
                            facts. He then read a proposed statement, which laid stress on the fact
                            that agreement to the International Access Authority proposal had been
                            given by Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> last
                            June.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> said his intial reaction
                            to this suggestion was to wonder whether such a statement might not
                            serve only to stir things up and blow them out of proportion. It would
                            tend to focus attention pointedly on the existence of an area of
                            misunderstanding and might well lead to all sorts of public speculation
                            which could be damaging to our relations. It would tend to revive in the
                            press the ghost of the previous misunderstandings of some months ago. It
                            was possible the current flurry might blow over quickly. He would,
                            therefore, advise against making any such statement to the press at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName> commented that
                            the President’s remarks had been limited to the question of civilian
                            access. It was correct to say that our proposals for an International
                            Access Authority had at one time publicly been shot down by the Germans.
                            Probably the impression which had remained strongest in our minds was
                            the great public hullabaloo which <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357"
                                facs="0379"/>had resulted from the Chancellor’s public denunciation
                            last Spring of the international access proposal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> commented that the basic
                            idea involved here was that we considered it appropriate for the Germans
                            to take a more active role in working for a solution of our mutual
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said that
                            upon reflection he tended to agree with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2"
                                >Tyler</persName> that the suggested press statement might only
                            serve to stir things up. At the same time he was anxious to get the
                            matter in proper focus before the arrival of Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and the latter’s talk with the
                            President. He felt he should consult with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> on the problem right away. He
                            wished the President to be aware before his talk with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> that the Germans had in fact
                            accepted last June the proposal for an access authority.</p>
                        <p>At two separate points during the conversation Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> commented, rather
                            defensively, that he had felt it would have been inappropriate for him
                            to take any major part in the discussion between the President and Mayor

                        <p>Secretary stressed that picture of Western determination as it appears to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> must appear

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> observed that decisive

                            accretions to european forces but US determination and willingness use

                            therefore welcomed indications US prepared to go it alone in defense of
                            Berlin should that be necessary.</p>
                        <p>Secretary agreed US nuclear deterrent ultimately decisive but to be
                            persuasive to Soviets US people and their Government must have
                            conviction their european Allies are making comparable effort.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> noted his belief that

                                >UN</gloss>, Secretary made point we should not fear <gloss

                            might play important subsequent role. Secretary also recalled <persName

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> doubted that Soviets were

                            lost interest since then. Soviets, too, think this is one of matters
                            that is ripe for solution.</p>
                        <p>After this problem, he said, most important is question of
                            Germany-Berlin. President has been heating up atmosphere and has called

                            to President and his remarks have been distorted. When he talks with
                            foreigners, he says Soviets will sign a peace treaty, with all the
                            consequences that would follow, and he also says that any war would
                            inevitably grow into nuclear war. Consequently, anyone who would start a
                            war would be either a lunatic or a coward. In the last couple of days,
                            he read a statement by some US military officer who said US would
                            unilaterally start a war if USSR signed separate peace treaty. This was
                            silly statement. This officer perhaps knows how to talk to his wife, but
                            he does not know how to talk to the press. “We will sign a peace treaty,
                            but no one who is sane will start a war.” Peace treaty does not threaten
                            anyone. People who lose their self-control and talk like that officer
                            are either cowards or lunatics. But if agreement is not reached with US,
                            Soviets cannot postpone signature of peace treaty indefinitely.</p>

                            care. But German people want their children to live. However, Americans
                            listen very carefully to <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>
                            and he is leading Americans. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> said he would give his reply to <persName

                        <p>US elections will take place, he said, and then we’ll try to renew
                            dialogue and reach agreement. Soviets won’t sign peace treaty
                            immediately; they know unilateral signing would be aggravation.</p>
                        <p>He asked what problem still remained. Only stationing of troops; there is
                            no problem on access. Soviets believe access, both by land and by air,
                            should be guaranteed with or without treaty. They have made still
                            another concession by agreeing to presence of troops in West Berlin
                            under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> flag. So only problem is
                            composition of troops, which may include US troops, but must also
                            include others, so that not only <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            military bloc would have troops there. If US doesn’t agree, that would
                            force Soviets to sign peace treaty despite fact US is threatening to
                            start war. Must be recognized that, in our electronic age, when one
                            button is pressed, other button is pressed automatically. There is no
                            sense in dialogue of threats. This is silly policy. So US should take
                            position of reason.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> asked why US needs West
                            Berlin. US, Britain and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            are sticking to West Berlin because <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> interested in it. <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName>’s interest is natural. But why is America
                            interested? No one threatens West Berlin. US says it is for freedom of
                            West Berlin. Soviets are also for that freedom. But we must liquidate
                            state of war and military base in West Berlin, which is a remnant of
                            war.</p>
                        <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0383"/>
                        <p>If agreement can be reached on stopping tests and West Berlin, this would
                            help us to solve problem of disarmament. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> said he thought US not ready for disarmament
                            agreement; Congress is not ready and President’s hands are tied, so let
                            us solve some other questions. Let’s do away with bases and disband our
                            troops. US can send rockets from its own territory. These are not old
                            times when infantry was used, so he was surprised when President called
                            150,000 reserves. These are not times of Kutuzoy or Suvorov, when
                            battles were fought with bayonets.</p>
                        <p>He said probably he would travel to <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>
                            at end November. early in November, he would be busy with domestic
                            problems. If situation were favorable then, he would be glad to meet
                            with President. He had good recollections meeting with President. Then
                            perhaps they could: (1) agree on test ban, which he would like to do;
                            (2) exchange views on disarmament; and (3) he would also alike to agree
                            on West Berlin and create a calmer atmosphere for disarmament. For time
                            being, Soviets would do nothing and make no statements until elections.
                            He had given his word on that.</p>
                        <p>I said I thought President would find his statement interesting and,
                            referring to President’s press-conference comment on readiness to meet,
                            said I would hope meanwhile there would be no developments which would
                            make a meeting difficult. Perhaps progress could be made at a lower
                            level in preparation for such a meeting. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> was to see President day after tomorrow and then
                            have working dinner with Secretary. Berlin would probably be discussed.
                            I should therefore withhold my own comment on his remarks on Berlin.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> repeated that they
                            would not undertake anything to worsen relations. He regretted that
                            things had not worked out in accordance with his discussion with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>. It was
                            regrettable that Cuban question had blown up right in middle of election
                            campaign. He had read accounts of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>’s talks with <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Home</persName>
                            and there was nothing new on West Berlin problem there. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Home</persName> had raised question of control
                            of flights, but this was trifle. If, as result President’s meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, <persName

                                >Gromyko</persName> could agree on something, that would be good,
                            but he doubted they could.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> then noted he had not
                            known earlier that appointment was fixed for <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> with President. I said we had just learned this
                            today. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> said he was
                            glad and thanked President for finding time to receive <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> said he wanted to
                            review these questions today and had not raised any new problems since
                            we had to settle old ones. He wished me good health in Russian climate
                            and hoped political climate would also be good. He said great countries
                            like ours had special responsibilities. For themselves, they wanted
                            peace and peaceful competition. <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0384"
                            />Great ships had to sail in high seas and he hoped they would sail
                            without interference. I said I took good note of what he had said and
                            would report to President his statements on Germany and Berlin. Perhaps
                            Secretary would be discussing this with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>, but I thought I should add that we had gone as
                            far as we could, short of our vital interests, that is, stationing of
                            our forces. We are for co-existing in this situation. I was very glad to
                            hear Chairman say he wanted to talk further about it and was sure
                            President would, too.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> asked me to convey best

                            campaign, as well as wishes for good health and success to his family,

                        <p>The President said he was glad to see the Foreign Minister. He had come
                            at a helpful time, since there was a strong feeling there would be
                            difficulties over Berlin within the next two to three months. He would
                            appreciate hearing the Foreign Minister’s thoughts as to the actions the
                            Soviets were likely to take and on our contingency plans to meet
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister thanked the President for this opportunity to meet
                            with him and said he brought cordial greetings from the Chancellor. He
                            regarded his own visit as a useful preparation for the Chancellor’s
                            visit next month.</p>
                        <p>Regarding Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said he
                            was not certain in his own mind whether the Soviets really intended to
                            sharpen the crisis by their own actions in late November or before the
                            end of the year. He felt it more likely that they would continue to
                            bring various psychological pressures to bear and meanwhile they would
                            wish to keep talking in the hope of achieving their objectives without
                            war. There were several factors to consider: First, the Soviets had thus
                            far received little support from other countries regarding their project
                            for a separate peace treaty with east Germany. From the standpoint of
                            their posture before world public opinion it would not be so attractive
                            to the Soviets to have only themselves and their “sub-contractors” in
                            the Bloc as signatories of the treaty. From our own viewpoint the
                            attitude taken thus far by the non-committed states had been a positive
                            factor. Second, with regard to what specific measures the Soviets might
                            take in Berlin, from their standpoint they did not have a great deal of
                            leeway and there were only a limited number of steps which they could
                            take if they were to avoid a real confrontation. There was also the
                            question of what actions might be taken by the Soviet Zone
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>One big problem in this area related to civilian access, where the other
                            side might introduce a passport and visa requirement. In such event we
                            would have to take care to avoid any deterioration in the access
                            situation. The difficulty was that most of the questions here related to
                            pieces of paper; at the outset the other side, instead of giving the
                            piece of paper now in use, would introduce a requirement for a visa. The
                            problem was that while the change from the standpoint of what met the
                            eye would not be very great, from the legal standpoint the change would
                            be a very subtantial one. To accept visas would mean subjecting land
                            access to the complete discretion of the east Zone authorities and would
                            increase recognition of the east Zone regime. (<persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> referred in passing to the
                            difficulty created by the fact many foreigners traveling <pb n="364"
                                xml:id="pg_364" facs="0386"/>to Berlin, including United States
                            civilians, had already accepted <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            visas, which he said was unfortunate.)</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he was convinced that if we should accept any
                            deterioration in civilian access, we would one day find ourselves on the
                            spot as concerned military access. If new paper formalities were
                            introduced for military access, it would be difficult from the
                            standpoint of international law to reject these if we had already
                            accepted them for civilian access. The Foreign Minister then outlined
                            the hypothetical situation under which on December 1 the Soviets would
                            sign a separate peace treaty with east Germany to take effect on January
                            1. They might specify that for a transitional period of six months
                            Western troops could stay in Berlin, but also that meanwhile a new piece
                            of paper would be required for travel to Berlin which could be obtained
                            either at Pankow or at the border checkpoint. What would the West do
                            between December 1 and January 1 and what would it do after January 1?
                            World opinion would have to be considered; there was the risk that if we
                            decided to keep access open by force, world opinion would say that there
                            had not been a sufficient change in procedures to justify this. He felt
                            we needed to make it perfectly clear to the Soviets that if they tried
                            this game they would not succeed and that any effort on their part to
                            proceed by installment would fail. The conclusion to be drawn was that
                            our contingency planning must consider realistically the matter of
                            reacting strongly to prevent any deterioration in the field of civilian
                            access to Berlin. In the political, diplomatic and psychological fields,
                            we must do everything possible to make clear to the Soviets that we have
                            no intention of accepting the visa requirement and would react strongly
                            if this were imposed. Furthermore, the relationship and interdependence
                            between civilian and military traffic must be taken realistically into
                            account in our contingency planning.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed there was a clear interrelationship between civilian
                            and military traffic, but said there was at the same time a substantial
                            difference in that our military forces could be supplied by air.
                            Furthermore, civilian traffic was now treated on a different basis from
                            military traffic and the east Zone authorities had for some time had
                            considerably greater authority over civilian than military traffic. Was
                            this not true?</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister agreed but said the danger nevertheless existed that
                            once we had accepted a deterioration in civilian traffic, changes in
                            military traffic which were optically minor in character would be
                            difficult to reject. The big question was whether or not we could accept
                            any deterioration in civilian traffic. If the answer was “no”, then what
                            specifically did we do about it? Theoretically, of course, we could
                            resort to an airlift for the transport of personnel, but given problems
                            about the weather, electronic countermeasures, etc., this would not <pb
                                n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0387"/>solve the problem of access of
                            goods. One essential at stake here was the viability of Berlin, which
                            would be threatened by reliance on an airlift. If the airlift and
                            economic countermeasures did not prove effective, we might find that we
                            would have to retreat from our position, which would involve a great
                            loss of prestige. Therefore, the question of how we should react at the
                            outset was extremely important. He was not satisfied with the middle
                            solution being recommended up to now, which was to continue vital
                            traffic to Berlin, accept visas for this under protest, and apply
                            economic countermeasures. He said he felt it was necessary to re-think
                            our whole planning on this question.</p>
                        <p>One additional factor to take into account was the reaction of the
                            Berliners themselves. Their main concern was not the recognition problem
                            but unrestricted access. There was, therefore, some difference in
                            perspective between Berlin’s and the Western position as a whole; it was
                            necessary to try to harmonize these interests.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired: Suppose they insist on visas and we do not accept
                            this and ground traffic to Berlin stops, then where are we?</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said basically the question in such a case was
                            whether we will and can keep access open by force or whether we should
                            resort to an airlift and await the effect of our countermeasures. He
                            himself considered it a dangerous position to think we could solve the
                            problem of access by an airlift.</p>
                        <p>The President said our plans were clear on what to do in the event of a
                            blockage of traffic by force. The basic question was whether, if the
                            blockage was in fact only by paper, we would be justified in using
                            force.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister commented that if we accept visas at this point,
                            even though viability is clearly involved, what are our chances in the
                            military field of refusing procedural changes and what chances do we
                            have to react by force to them if we have accepted the visa for civilian
                            traffic?</p>
                        <p>The President again said that civilian traffic was a different problem
                            since military traffic could be moved by air. If we did not accept visas
                            for civilian traffic then we would have a self-imposed blockade. We
                            might find ourselves in a slightly ridiculous position, and the
                            Berliners themselves might not be entirely sympathetic nor understand
                            why their viability was being threatened merely because of disagreements
                            and too legalistic arguments over whether or not to accept a piece of
                            paper.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he was fully aware this was a difficult
                            problem. He considered that land access was very important to military
                            traffic and that the problem of military access could not now be solved
                            by an airlift. The situation was different from 1948–49. He did not
                            believe that we could now resort to an airlift without suffering a
                            severe diplomatic and political defeat. He stressed again we must get
                            our position <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0388"/>worked out clearly
                            and in detail to cover every possible situation. He again expressed
                            concern over our solution up to now to let essential civilian traffic
                            continue by accepting visas under protest, while at the same time
                            applying economic countermeasures by reduction or termination of
                            interzonal trade and the employment of further measures by the Allies
                            and in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. If all these measures
                            remained without effect we were in a situation where we had reduced
                            access to Berlin dangerously and would still be faced with the decision
                            whether or not eventually to accept the visa requirement. We would be
                            operating on a declining scale.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was not sure we should make visas the great issue.
                            We did not want Berlin blockaded. Was the visa issue the one on which we
                            would employ force rather than countermeasures? Were we in a position to
                            fight our way up the Autobahn over the visa requirement when we had been
                            accepting for a long time a piece of paper for civilian traffic?</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that the problem was whether we should accept
                            the Soviets’ salami tactics of piece-by-piece encroachment. He
                            recognized the great difficulty was in the political-psychological field
                            since people would ask why should we use force over this small matter.
                            The danger in this was that we could lose the game by installments
                            without any really major development having taken place. As for the
                            popular reaction in Germany, it is clear that people would be
                            discouraged over continued acceptance of minor encroachments. The people
                            in Pankow would regard it as a victory for them if the visa requirement
                            were accepted. Furthermore, the Soviets would look on this development
                            as a further success which would encourage them to take additional
                            steps.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he wished to stress that Berlin could be held
                            only if the Soviets could be convinced there was some specific point
                            beyond which they could not go without encountering a strong reaction
                            from us. While <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> might
                            be convinced that at some point the West would be prepared to fight a
                            nuclear war over Berlin, he was likely nevertheless to continue to try
                            to reach his objectives piece by piece. The problem for us to decide was
                            how to deal with each move as it occurs, whether it be a visa
                            requirement or not. He felt that the problem went much further than
                            merely involving acceptance of a piece of paper.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed it was important to reach a decision on this within
                            the next three or four weeks. He said we must be careful not to draw the
                            line at the wrong place. As concerned civilian traffic to Berlin, this
                            was now in fact controlled by the east Germans who issued papers,
                            stamps, etc. It was not clear that an introduction of a visa requirement
                            was a dramatic enough development to set in train all the major actions
                            involved in our contingency planning. If we made a big issue over a <pb
                                n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0389"/>piece of paper and then had to
                            retreat, this would be a defeat for us. We wondered whether the actual
                            movement of civilian traffic in and out of Berlin was not the big issue
                            rather than the acceptance of visas.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said there was one big potential difference between
                            visas and the present documentation requirements. It was not excluded
                            that in issuing visas the east German authorities would eventually
                            require that they be obtained in east Berlin, or possibly in an effort
                            to appear reasonable, they might offer to open visa-issuing offices in
                            West Berlin or West Germany. They could also if they wished impose a
                            limit, such as 50,000 a month, on the number of visas to be issued for
                            travel to Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought that our economic countermeasures would
                            prove sufficiently oppressive so that measures of this type would not be
                            useful to the other side.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he was not convinced that economic
                            countermeasures would prove effective if the other side had already
                            decided it was prepared to run the full risk of their imposition.</p>
                        <p>At this point in the conversation, which had already lasted for an hour,
                            the President suggested we might turn to other matters. He referred to
                            the history of the discussions with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> over Berlin, which had thus far been
                            unsuccessful. There now appeared at least a possibility that the Soviets
                            might withdraw their main condition regarding Western troop withdrawal
                            and shift their accent to the access problem. We had repeatedly made
                            clear that the issue of maintaining our troops in Berlin was not
                            negotiable. It was, therefore, not clear why <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> was coming over. Did the Foreign Minister
                            have any thoughts on this?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said it was not clear to
                            him whether <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would come
                            to the United Nations or not. He had in any event skillfully used this
                            possibility to get the West to indulge in a great deal of unproductive
                            speculation. If he did come it was not clear he would be prepared to
                            steer the hardest course. He would in any event expect that something
                            could be accomplished. In March and July at Geneva the Soviets had
                            stressed that the only crucial issue remaining unresolved was the
                            Western presence in Berlin. He felt that they were too optimistic over
                            other issues, such as nuclear weapons, non-diffusion, non-aggression
                            pact, etc., which they presented as practically agreed. He felt the
                            Soviets were still convinced some further compromise over Berlin was
                            possible. They had probably regarded their original proposal for a free
                            demilitarized city in November, 1958 as a compromise offer intended to
                            serve as a face-saver. At Geneva they had suggested the possibility of a
                            phased withdrawal of Western troops from Berlin concurrently with
                            reduction of troops from other countries which would be introduced over
                            a period of four years, at the end of which the problem would be
                            settled. They <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0390"/>were probably
                            still thinking in terms of a compromise, and he thought that if
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> came to this
                            country he would be thinking in terms of some new compromise offer,
                            perhaps strengthening elengthening] the time period to ten, eight or six
                            years, rather than wishing to run the risk of a showdown over Berlin. He
                            said this was just his personal opinion and he could not prove he was
                            right.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that, returning briefly to the visa problem, it
                            seemed imperative to get this settled before the end of the month. It
                            should be discussed in the Ambassadorial Group with the British and
                            French. (<persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> interjected
                            that the agreement of the Berliners was also important.)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> commented that while our
                            contingency planning had been going on for a year or so, there was still
                            not complete agreement at several points. The time had come where our
                            over-all planning must be brought up-to-date and possibly “streamlined”.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had made this
                            same point to him yesterday.<note n="1" xml:id="d134fn1">A memorandum of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s conversation
                                with <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> is in the
                                Kennedy Library, President’s Office Files,
                                Germany/Security.</note><persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> suggested it might be advisable to conduct war
                            games in which all contingencies would be played through, with our most
                            intelligent players acting in the role of Soviets. (In a further brief
                            discussion of this suggestion the President stated that in fact
                            geography was the greatest asset on the Soviet side of the game.)</p>
                        <p>The President then turned to this morning’s newspaper account of an
                            interview given in Germany by Defense Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> in which he had made two main
                            points: 1) the comradeship established between the French and Germans on
                            military matters, and 2) the role of German troops in the defense of
                            Berlin. On the latter point the President said that in case of a crunch
                            the issue would be decided by which side had the greater strength rather
                            than by legal considerations over our right to be in Berlin.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> replied that he did not
                            have the full text of <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>’
                            interview. As concerned the matter of French-German comradeship in arms
                            (he asked “did <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> really say
                            that”?), he would make only one statement, viz., that on this point he
                            had as realistic a view as the President himself. He considered the
                            second point to be more important. As concerned the German commitment in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, it was the same as that of
                            the United States and there should be no question about this. The point
                                <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> apparently was making
                            regarding the use of German troops over Berlin presumably reflected the
                            actual situation as concerned the relationship between Live Oak and
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. That related to the situation
                            on paper; in practical fact, however, in the event of military conflict
                            over <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0391"/>Berlin the Germans would
                            be in there from the first moment because they were right up in
                            front.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to his recent talk with the French Foreign
                                Minister<note n="2" xml:id="d134fn2">See <ref target="#d130"
                                    >Document 130</ref>.</note> as indicating a sharp division
                            between us over Allied military strategy, particularly as concerned the
                            disposition of forces. We had not been able to convince the French to
                            move their troops forward, and if this could not be done it would be
                            difficult of make effective military plans. The President felt West
                            Germany had an important role to play in resolving these
                            differences.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said the Germans intended
                            to try to make clear to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            that the present situation was not satisfactory. The French had claimed
                            that their problem arose from the need to maintain French forces coming
                            from Algeria on French soil for the time being. This point was not very
                            convincing. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> felt that
                            the French over-all military strategy was based on the premise that
                            there were two battles to consider: the one in Germany, which would be
                            lost, and the one in France, which would be won. This had in fact been
                            the premise of the most recent military maneuver conducted by the
                            French. This seemed to him to be thinking of another century, but also
                            possibly indicated that in such matters the French were great military
                            geniuses.</p>
                        <p>The President said he hoped that Messrs.<note n="3" xml:id="d134fn3"
                                    ><persName>Pierre A. Messmer</persName>, French Defense
                                Minister.</note><persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> and
                            Messmer would be able to settle this matter of troop dispositions.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> commented it would
                            be better to reach agreement with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> than with Messmer.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would have to leave shortly for Connecticut. He
                            much appreciated the efforts which had been made by Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> to coordinate our joint
                            policy. We would consider carefully his views on the visa problem and
                            reach a decision. The basic problem was that we would either have to
                            decide that here is where we take our stand, or else we should prepare
                            the way for playing down the issue and making it unimportant. The
                            President commented that he did not regard the forthcoming <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> visit as particularly
                            desirable in the absence of evidence, which we did not yet have, of any
                            change in his attitude over Berlin. He would not himself encourage
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> to come, but if he
                            wished to come the President would see him. Meanwhile we should improve
                            our planning. There should be more realistic discussions in the
                            Ambassadorial Group. In addition, he felt that Governments should be
                            more committed in advance to actions agreed on by the planners. He cited
                            as an example that until recently he had not realized that it <pb
                                n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0392"/>would take three days before we
                            could mount our initiative probing on the Autobahn. We, for our part,
                            were ready to say what we would do, and he felt that all four
                            Governments should be prepared to give more in the way of firm
                            commitments. In conclusion, the President stated that Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>’s visit had been very
                            useful.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> thanked the
                            President for this meeting and said he hoped that by their next meeting
                            on November 7 we would have our planning perfected and be ready for
                            definitive discussions.</p>

                            President’s approval, he thought he might take those questions one by
                            one and listen to the comments the President might wish to make on each
                            of them individually.</p>
                        <p>The President said this was all right with him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then stated that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had instructed him
                            to take the opportunity of his trip to the United States and to convey
                            to the President that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> continued to hope that the President’s
                            efforts, like his own, would be directed toward the elimination of
                            differences and of points at issue between our two countries. Such
                            elimination had been and continued to be the invariable desire of the
                            Soviet Government and of the Soviet people. The Soviet Government
                            regretted that no agreement had been reached in the course of the
                            exchanges of views between the US and the USSR on the question of a
                            German peace treaty and of normalizing the West Berlin situation on the
                            basis of such a treaty. Unfortunately, the latest meetings with the
                            Secretary had not changed the situation. No progress had been made in
                            spite of the fact that, as had been also stressed by US representatives,
                            West Berlin and its status did not present a major problem and was not a
                            vital issue for the United States or its Allies. Indeed, the West Berlin
                            situation was a legacy of the last war. The Soviet Government had stated
                            on a number of occasions that the Soviet Union had no direct vital
                            interests in West Berlin and did not need West Berlin. The Soviet
                            Government deemed it necessary to conclude a German peace treaty and
                            resolve the West Berlin problem on the basis of such a treaty by
                            declaring West Berlin a free and demilitarized city; such a solution
                            would meet the interests of world peace. Of course, the Soviet Union
                            could never agree to West Berlin’s remaining a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> base, to a continuation of the presence of occupation
                            troops of the three Western powers and to the maintenance of the
                            occupation regime in West Berlin; nor could it agree to West Berlin’s
                            remaining a hotbed of aggressive explosion. The fact was that presence
                            of occupation forces of the three Western powers in West Berlin yielded
                            nothing to the West strategically, and this proved that there was no
                            reason for keeping those forces in West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said that the
                            Soviet Government had already indicated that it would do nothing with
                            regard to West Berlin before the US elections, unless it was compelled
                            to do otherwise by the activities of the other side. However, the Soviet
                            Government proceeded from the fact that it was necessary to hold an
                            active dialogue in November to bring about concrete results with regard
                            to a German peace treaty and to the normalization of the West Berlin
                            situation on the basis of such a treaty. The Soviet Government would
                            like to hope that at that time an understanding concerning a German
                            peace treaty, including the question <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372"
                                facs="0394"/>of the forces of the three Western powers and of the
                            status of West Berlin, would at last be reached. If there should be no
                            such understanding, the Soviet Government would be compelled, and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wished to emphasize
                            the word “compelled”, to sign, together with a number of other states, a
                            peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> without an
                            understanding with the Western Powers. The Soviet Union would also be
                            compelled to take such steps as were integrally linked with a peace
                            settlement, steps of which the United States Government and the
                            President personally had been informed on a number of occasions,
                            including by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            personally. The Soviet Government proceeded from the assumption that the
                            United States Government would take such steps as being only inevitable
                            in this connection and would understand that they represented a peaceful
                            effort. As to the threats that could be heard in the United States in
                            connection with the possibility of the USSR’s signing a peace treaty
                            with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in the event that no
                            understanding with the West was reached, i.e., in the event that the
                            Soviet Union acted as the West had acted with respect to Japan, the
                            Soviet Government wished to emphasize once again that such threats could
                            not produce the effect desired by those who made them. Threats had no
                            effect on the USSR whatsoever; instead of indulging in them it would be
                            better to root out the remnants of World War II.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he was speaking
                            on behalf of the Soviet Government as sincerely as Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had spoken in Vienna when he
                            spoke in favor of an agreed solution of the problem of the German peace
                            settlement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> recalled
                            that the President had said that he appreciated frankness. The Soviet
                            Government also appreciated frankness, because frank conversations were
                            the shortest way to understanding and clarification of respective
                            positions. As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had
                            said, the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military base and the
                            occupation regime in West Berlin represented a rotten tooth which must
                            be pulled out, and no one would be harmed by that. One could not take
                            seriously assertions that it was necessary to maintain a <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base in West Berlin in order to
                            protect the West Berlin population. As a matter of fact, the Soviet
                            Government was in favor of respecting the freedom of the West Berlin
                            population, but no <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base was needed
                            for that purpose.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued that the
                            Soviet Government had some specific points concerning what had been
                            discussed in the course of the US/USSR exchanges of views. Recently, in
                            conversations with <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName>
                            and the Secretary, it had been suggested that an international air
                            access authority be established. It had also been stated that such an
                            arrangement would involve respect for the sovereignty of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The Soviet Union was prepared to take
                            account of this suggestion and proposed the following two alternatives:
                            (a) creation of an international arbitration authority to be concerned
                            with all types of access; the Soviet views on <pb n="373"
                                xml:id="pg_373" facs="0395"/>such an authority had been stated in
                            detail to the Secretary in earlier conversations; or (b) creation of
                            such an authority to deal solely with air access. The latter was a new
                            proposal, and it could be discussed in greater detail later tonight with
                            the Secretary. In making this step forward toward the position of the
                            United States and the United Kingdom, the Soviet Government proceeded on
                            the assumption that at the same time a solution to all other problems
                            relating to a German peace settlement and West Berlin would be
                            found.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then recalled the
                            Secretary’s remarks during the last meeting to the effect that United
                            States favored the development of contacts between West and East
                            Germans. The Soviet Union, he said, was also in favor of such contacts
                            because they would promote alleviation of the situation in Germany and
                            Europe as a whole. However, it went without saying that the development
                            of such contacts did not mean solution of the main problem. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> went on to say that
                            the Soviet Union was also prepared to take into account US views
                            regarding unification and it was prepared to include in a German peace
                            settlement and a German peace treaty provision concerning the
                            possibility of German unification. This could be done either in the form
                            of an agreed joint statement of the powers concerned, or such a
                            provision could be included in a peace treaty with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. As to the Soviet position on
                            unification, it was well known to the United States; the Soviet Union
                            believed that reunification was a matter for the two German states to
                            resolve.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said he wished to
                            stress that when a solution of the West Berlin problem was found on a
                            basis corresponding to the interests of peace and the interests of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty, and when other
                            related problems, on which there had been some rapprochement between the
                            US and the USSR, were also resolved, then actually there would remain no
                            problem on which the two countries were in direct confrontation. Under
                            those circumstances disarmament would also be easier to solve,
                            particularly in view of the invigorated international situation which
                            would then prevail, and particularly in Europe. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that those were the views
                            of the Soviet Government concerning a German peace settlement and the
                            question of West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The President said he knew that the Secretary and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had discussed the Berlin
                            problem for many months; thus the USSR was familiar with our position.
                            Also, he, the President, had discussed this problem with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> here at the White House in
                            September of last year. The US, the President emphasized, was anxious to
                            work out mutually satisfactory procedures on access. The US had made
                            several proposals on this point, and the USSR had made some too.
                            However, the matter which was of greatest concern to us was that of the
                            withdrawal of Western forces. West Berlin was not a <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base and the Western forces there had
                            no offensive capabilities. The United States desired that <pb n="374"
                                xml:id="pg_374" facs="0396"/>West Berlin not be used as a base for
                            subversion. However, we were unable to withdraw our forces and thus
                            endanger the freedom of West Berlin. We were prepared to engage in a
                            dialogue in November, but this of course involved our friends, including
                            the French. However on the question of withdrawing the Western forces
                            from West Berlin we were in disagreement. As to other matters, the
                            President said he thought they should continue to be explored; those
                            matters included access, both air and ground, the role and the juridical
                            status of forces in West Berlin, etc. All of these matters could be
                            discussed. However there could be no discussion of the presence of
                            Western forces, which was a matter of survival; thus we disagreed on
                            that point. If the US were to accept what the Soviet Union had
                            suggested, i.e., if we were to withdraw our forces, the city and access
                            to it would be under complete control of East Germany, and East Germany
                            could also control movement of persons and goods. Under such conditions
                            the city could no longer remain free; our commitments would become
                            invalid, and we would have withdrawn from the positions the US and the
                            West had taken for many years. The President said he did not believe
                            that the Soviet proposal would guarantee the security of West Berlin,
                            and its freedom could not be maintained under such conditions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he wished to
                            comment on one particular remark by the President. He said that the
                            Soviet Union had tried to dispel the apprehensions and suspicions voiced
                            by the US Government concerning the creation of a free and demilitarized
                            city of West Berlin. The President had said that if the Soviet proposal
                            were to be accepted West Berlin would come under the control of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and that the social order of
                            West Berlin would be threatened by this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> asserted that there was no reason for such
                            fears, or doubts, or suspicions, because the USSR was prepared to
                            undertake solemn guarantees, together with the US and the other Western
                            Powers and also with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, insuring
                            respect for the status of West Berlin. He professed not to be able to
                            understand why the President believed that the collective weight and
                            prestige of those nations or the weight and prestige of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would not constitute sufficient
                            guarantees of what the President called the freedom of West Berlin. As
                            to access, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that
                            there was no problem here. The Soviet Union favored unrestricted access
                            to West Berlin as a free and demilitarized city; it was in favor of
                            unrestricted ties between that city and the outer world, and it was in
                            favor of the development of trade and cultural relations with the city.
                            In the course of the US/USSR exchanges of views, the Soviet Government
                            had tried to convince the United States that it was in favor of the
                            strictest possible guarantees in this respect.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he appreciated this, but emphasized that if the
                            Soviet Union desired to continue to permit the people of West Berlin <pb
                                n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0397"/>to choose their fate, he did
                            not see why withdrawal of Western forces was of any importance. Contrary
                            to Soviet assertions, West Berlin was not a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> base and our troops there were symbolic. Since we had
                            said that this point was vital to us, we failed to see why it should not
                            be possible to work out access with our troops remaining in West Berlin.
                            The President reiterated that those troops were a symbolic guarantee of
                            the freedom of the city, and that of course was of great significance.
                            If the Soviet Union desired to let the West Berlin population choose its
                            own government, then presence of those troops should not create any
                            problem. Those troops were not endangering the security of the Soviet
                            Union or any other country in East Europe.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that it was well
                            known, and the President would not deny this, that presence of Western
                            forces in West Berlin was a result of World War II. Both Western and
                            Soviet troops had come to Germany and West Berlin as occupation troops
                            as a result of the defeat of Nazi Germany. However, he wished to point
                            out with the President’s permission that the most dangerous slice of the
                            last war had remained in West Berlin in the form of Western forces. The
                            President was of course right in saying—and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had agreed on this point
                            with the President at Vienna—that the Western forces in West Berlin
                            could play nonmilitary role. However this made the Soviet Union wonder
                            all the more why, despite this fact, the West still insisted on
                            maintaining those forces. Moreover, it should be noted that even a small
                            number of troops can represent a danger of war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued that he
                            wished to emphasize once again—and this was also Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s view—that if the question
                            of West Berlin were to be resolved on a mutually satisfactory basis,
                            there would remain no other questions on which our two states were at
                            loggerheads, with the possible exception of disarmament. If such a
                            solution were found, the peoples of our two countries and of the world
                            at large would sigh in relief and would thank the President and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> for their efforts
                            in bringing about such a success.</p>
                        <p>After some discussion of certain other matters, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that in conclusion he
                            wished to state that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had instructed him to convey to the President
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s belief that it
                            would be useful if the Heads of the Government of the United States and
                            the USSR met to discuss the problems which were dividing the two Powers,
                            and first and foremost the question of a German peace treaty and of West
                            Berlin. If Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> should
                            have an opportunity of doing so, he would come to New York in the latter
                            part of November in connection with the General Assembly. Thus, what was
                            meant was the possibility of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s coming after the U.S. elections.</p>
                        <p>The President said that if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> should come to the United States he would be
                            glad to meet with him again. However, the <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376"
                                facs="0398"/>President thought that it would be a mistake to
                            describe such a meeting as dealing with a peace treaty and West Berlin,
                            since others were involved in these matters and more formal discussions
                            would be required. Thus if the Chairman should come, he would be glad to
                            meet with him and discuss any questions, without however attempting to
                            organize an agenda.</p>

                                >Gromyko</persName> conversed alone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that since he was
                            going to leave soon, he wished to make some clarifications with respect
                            to the points which he had discussed with the President earlier
                                today,<note n="1" xml:id="d136fn1">See <ref target="#d135">Document
                                    135</ref>.</note> and particularly on the question of a German
                            peace treaty and of the normalization of the West Berlin situation on
                            the basis of such a treaty. Reading from a prepared text, he said that
                            the major obstacle to agreement between the two sides was the question
                            of the withdrawal of Western forces from West Berlin. If agreement were
                            to be reached on this question, the Soviet Union believed that the path
                            to agreement would be cleared. The Soviet Union could not accept the
                            present situation, no matter what arguments the U.S. adduced in
                            contending that West Berlin was not a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> military base, because objective reality was objective
                            reality. The Soviet Union did not underestimate, or to put it in a
                            positive way, it appreciated the <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0399"
                            />significance of the rapprochement on a number of questions relating to
                            a German peace settlement, which had resulted from the USSR exchanges of
                            views. The Secretary, of course, knew what those questions were. This
                            rapprochement was a definite and substantial step forward, but it did
                            not resolve the main issue. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> went on to say that during his last conversation
                            with the Secretary, certain important points relating to a German peace
                            settlement had been touched upon. The Soviet Union was prepared and
                            believed it to be useful to clarify the respective positions and to set
                            forth in more specific terms its own attitude on certain points raised
                            by the Secretary. He said that he now wished to discuss certain points
                            in greater detail than he had discussed them with the President.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued that the
                            Secretary, as well as <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord
                            Home</persName>, had touched upon the question of an international
                            access authority and of an international air access authority. The
                            Western side had emphasized that this proposal was based on respect for
                            the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and on the
                            existing international practices. If such were indeed the intentions of
                            the U.S., then, as he had said to the President, the USSR could take
                            account of the Western position. The USSR was prepared to agree to the
                            creation of an international arbitration authority to deal with air
                            access to West Berlin and to act in settling frictions if they were to
                            arise in the course of the actual implementation of an agreement on
                            access. He said he wished to stress that such an authority would be an
                            arbitration body and not a body that would be incompatible with the
                            sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The Soviet Union
                            proceeded from the premise that technical services related to air
                            traffic to and from West Berlin would be handled with the participation
                            of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> authorities. Alternatively, and
                            this would represent a broader arrangement, the USSR could also agree to
                            West Berlin’s being a party to the proposed international arbitration
                            body; the Soviet Union was willing to agree to such an arrangement in
                            order to facilitate agreement. Basically, the Soviet Union proposed a
                            choice between (a) an international arbitration body to deal with all
                            types of access, i.e., land, water, and air access, and the US was
                            familiar with the Soviet proposals for such a body; or (b) an
                            international arbitration body to deal only with air access. Thus, as
                            the Secretary could see, the Soviet Government was guided by the desire
                            of satisfying the wishes of the Western Powers and of meeting the
                            Western Powers half way. The USSR believed that these proposals by the
                            Soviet Union offered a basis for understanding, assuming that a solution
                            of other problems, and primarily that of the withdrawal of Western
                            forces, was found.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the Secretary’s remarks at the last meeting regarding the
                            desirability of contacts between West and East Germans, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> noted that he had already said
                            to the President that the Soviet <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0400"
                            />Union appreciated the Secretary’s statement to the effect that the
                            U.S. Government favored such contacts. He wished to reiterate that such
                            a position of the U.S. could further the alleviation of tensions in
                            Germany and Europe, particularly if measures were taken to stop
                            provocations against the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and to
                            guard the Western side of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            border. Of course, the U.S. Government was aware of the fact that the
                            Soviet Union had always been in favor of the development of cultural and
                            trade relations between the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and between West Berlin and the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Development of such contacts
                            and relations would contribute to a more tranquil situation and to more
                            normal relations between the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and
                            West Germany. However, it could not be overlooked that the development
                            of such contacts would not mean a solution of the main problems facing
                            the U.S. and the USSR in connection with a German peace settlement and
                            the normalization of the West Berlin situation, and above all the
                            question of the forces of the three Western Powers in West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>As to the question of German unification, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> said that he had already indicated to the
                            President what could be said about German unification in the process of
                            concluding a German peace treaty, together with agreed solution of other
                            questions linked with such a treaty. He wished to emphasize that the
                            Soviet Union desired an agreed solution of the questions relating to a
                            German peace settlement, including a peace treaty with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>; if such a solution were reached then a
                            provision might be included concerning the possibility of German
                            reunification. In this connection, he wished to state that such a
                            provision would not be contrary to the position of the Soviet Union,
                            because the Soviet Union had never believed that the door to unification
                            should be shut tight. The Soviet Union had always expressed the view
                            that if the Germans were to agree on a platform for unification, the
                            Soviet Union would accept it as a fact. As was well known, the Soviet
                            Union considered that the question of German unification was a matter
                            for the two sovereign German states to resolve. As to the provision
                            concerning German unification, such a provision could be incorporated
                            either in an agreed joint statement of the Powers concerned or in a
                            peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. In any event,
                            the Soviet Union believed that if agreement were reached with the West
                            on the questions which must be resolved in connection with a German
                            peace settlement, including the major issue of the withdrawal of the
                            occupation forces of the three Western Powers from West Berlin and the
                            elimination of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military base
                            in West Berlin, a mutual understanding on this point would not be a
                            problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he
                            deemed it necessary to make these remarks in the hope that they would
                            find due understanding on the part of U.S. and the other Western Powers
                            and would facilitate agreement on other questions which must be resolved
                            in connection with a German peace settlement.</p>
                        <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0401"/>
                        <p>The Secretary thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            for this further elaboration of the remarks he had made to the
                            President. Referring to access, the Secretary said he believed that
                            agreement on this problem should be possible. Basically, if the
                            Four-Power arrangements contained in the Jessup-Malik agreement on
                            access were to be adhered to, there should be no problem. In other
                            words, access would not intrude in the activities of the East German
                            authorities, nor would those authorities intrude in access. For
                            instance, when planes flew from Vienna to Athens over Yugoslav
                            territory, they did so with the permission of Yugoslav authorities and
                            thus they did not intrude in Yugoslav sovereignty; on the other hand,
                            Yugoslav authorities did not interfere in that traffic. If the Four
                            Powers could agree on a type of arrangement similar to that contained in
                            the Jessup-Malik agreement, there should be no difficulty. We had no
                            intention of intruding in the activities of <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> authorities. It was standard practice for aircraft to
                            fly over the territory of a country without that country interfering in
                            such flights.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then stressed that the major problem was that of the
                            presence of Western forces in West Berlin and stated that in all
                            seriousness there was no agreement on that question. On that question,
                            the Soviet Union must decide whether it wanted to go to war to remove
                            those forces. This point was fundamental to the West, but it appeared
                            that the more we explained our point of view, the greater the appetite
                            became on the part of the Soviet Union to accomplish its objective.
                            There was certainly no agreement on this question. We had sought to meet
                            the Soviet Union on such questions as boundaries and nuclear matters,
                            but on this point there was no understanding. No one could speak in
                            terms of eternity, but at present this was an utterly fundamental
                            question. The Secretary said that the U.S., and the President
                            personally, would study most carefully what Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said to see whether
                            anything could be done.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that when <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord
                                Home</persName> had spoken about air access, he had not been
                            speaking for the U.S. or the Western group as a whole. As far as we were
                            concerned, we supposed that all types of access, and not only air
                            access, should be considered. Since Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> had put forward two alternatives, we wished to
                            indicate our belief that the general problem should be treated as a
                            whole.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then emphasized that he did believe that there was
                            considerable advantage in contacts between West Germany and East Germany
                            and between West Berlin and East Berlin, because such contacts could
                            promote the interests of both sides and decrease tensions. Thus, we were
                            entirely in agreement that steps should be taken in that direction.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that the U.S. had tried to take certain steps in
                            the direction of narrowing the gap between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.,
                                <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0402"/>although this has created
                            certain tensions between the U.S. and some of its allies. However, there
                            was a point where vital interests were involved, and with reasonable
                            effort on both sides a solution to such problems should be found. The
                            Secretary recalled that we had interposed with regard to the provision
                            in the West German Constitution declaring West Berlin a Land of the
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Likewise, we had pursued a
                            policy in the nuclear field which eased the problem the Soviet Union
                            appeared to have with regard to nuclear matter in Central Europe. The
                            Secretary also recalled that he had indicated privately to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that the Eastern boundaries
                            were not a problem in a de facto and practical sense. However, there
                            were some points where we just could not agree. He hoped that the Soviet
                            Union would introduce some evidence of reciprocity in those questions so
                            that vital interests of both sides would be taken into account.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then observed that the President was leaving town tomorrow
                            and that he was to call on him tonight. He said we would discuss access
                            with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. We were
                            already engaged in discussions with our allies and hoped that we could
                            bring the positions of the two sides close together. However, he wished
                            to stress once again that the basic problem was that of the Western
                            forces in West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that as far as
                            the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was
                            concerned, the Soviet Union could never agree to dividing the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty in two parts or to any
                            arrangement encroaching on that sovereignty. The Soviet Union could
                            never sign any agreement providing for such an arrangement. What the
                            U.S. appeared to have in mind was respect for the sovereignty of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in form, with actions which
                            would contradict the principle of observance of that sovereignty. Such
                            plans should be cast aside. What the Soviet Union had in mind was that
                            standing international practices must be applied in full.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued that the
                            Soviet Union was negotiating with the U.S. on a German peace settlement
                            in the hope that a solution could be reached on an agreed basis. If
                            there were no such hope, the Soviet Union would not have negotiated with
                            the U.S. and would not have wasted its time. However, if it were to be
                            impossible to reach an understanding, there should be no doubt in
                            anybody’s mind that the Soviet Union would sign a peace treaty with the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and that all measures would be
                            taken which must be implemented in connection with a peace treaty and
                            which would safeguard the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            sovereignty, including measures related to access. It depended on the
                            Western Powers what would follow then. The Soviet Union wished to sign a
                            peace treaty and proposed peace. The Soviet Union was in favor of
                            reducing tensions in the world. If there was to be war, the West would
                            have to make it, but the Soviet Union would be able to stand up for
                            itself, and this also went <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0403"/>for
                            a number of other states which wished to sign a peace treaty. This was
                            the Soviet position, which he wished to emphasize once again.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> went on to say that
                            the U.S.S.R. could not agree to the West’s maintaining a military <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base in the center of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The West had come to Germany and West
                            Berlin as a result of the defeat of Nazi Germany, and so had the Soviet
                            Union. He wondered why the West wished to stay there indefinitely. He
                            said he wished to reiterate and reemphasize that the Soviet Union was
                            proposing a peaceful act.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stressed that the presence of the Soviet Union in East
                            Germany was also a result of Nazi Germany’s defeat; there was no
                            difference between Soviet presence in East Germany and our presence in
                            West Berlin. He suggested that the possibility of a few survivors
                            deciding who was right on this question be set aside and that both he
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> as Foreign
                            Ministers were in duty bound to avoid such disastrous results. If the
                            Soviet Union meant by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would control access, that
                            was totally unacceptable. Our view was that there should be no
                            interference by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in access, in
                            accordance with standard practice of international law. If the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would not interfere, there would be no
                            problem. However, if the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> wanted to
                            supervise a restricted access there was no prospect for agreement. We
                            agreed that the Soviet Union was a great power; however, the Soviet
                            Union must accept that the U.S. was also a great power.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asserted there was no
                            analogy between Western presence in West Berlin and Soviet presence in
                            East Germany. The U.S.S.R. was in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> on an entirely different basis, on the basis of
                            contractual commitments, just as the U.S. was in West Germany on the
                            basis of some contractual commitments with West Germany. The Soviet
                            Union had proposed that all foreign troops be withdrawn from foreign
                            territories, but unfortunately the U.S. had refused. As to West Berlin,
                            that was an entirely different matter and there was no analogy
                            whatsoever here, because the troops in West Berlin were occupation
                            troops and the occupation regime still prevailed in that city. As to
                            sovereignty, it was easy for the Secretary to rationalize. The Secretary
                            apparently meant if the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> should
                            intervene in access that would be unacceptable and would not correspond
                            to the U.S. concept of sovereignty, whereas things would be all right if
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> refrained from such acts. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he wished to
                            stress that there were no two types of sovereignty; there was only one
                            notion of sovereignty and only one norm of international practice, and
                            such practice must be applied to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            as to any other country. International norms which were standard
                            practice must fully apply to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.
                            Access could not be a barrier here, because the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> had stated its willingness to assume obligations to
                            ensure unrestricted access. The Soviet Union had stated that it was
                            prepared to underwrite those obligations together with the Western
                            Powers or with the <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0404"/><gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Soviet Union had always stressed its
                            belief that it should be possible to make unrestricted access compatible
                            with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty; in fact, the
                            Secretary himself had said this. Thus, he could not understand why the
                            Secretary was taking such liberties in treating sovereignty; little
                            could remain of sovereignty as a result of such treatment, and the
                            Soviet Union could not agree to that. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> said he wished to make these clarifications
                            because there was perhaps some lack of understanding of the Soviet
                            position on the part of the U.S. Both sides were negotiating and their
                            respective positions must be understood correctly. He had been patiently
                            clarifying the Soviet position because perhaps there was some
                            misunderstanding which should be eliminated.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said he wished to ask a direct question. He wished Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would tell him
                            whether today, as of this day, he considered that the Soviet Union had
                            obligations to the U.S., the U.K, and France, with respect to the
                            presence of Western forces in and access to West Berlin. He wondered
                            whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> regarded this
                            as existing obligations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that, speaking
                            briefly, the Soviet view was that the occupation regime in West Berlin
                            had outlived itself and that it could not live forever. The U.S.
                            Government appeared to believe, in spite of the fact that 17 years had
                            passed since World War II, that the occupation regime and the occupation
                            forces in West Berlin represented a normal situation. Yet the Soviet
                            Union believed that this was not a normal situation; indeed it was an
                            absolutely abnormal situation. It was impossible to conceive that the
                            Western Powers could really believe they could tear up such allied
                            obligations as were not agreeable to the West, while insisting on those
                            obligations which were to its liking. The U.S.S.R. could not accept such
                            an approach, which was tantamount to an arbitrary interpretation of the
                            situation. Moreover, a free and demilitarized city of West Berlin would
                            not harm anyone; a German peace settlement and normalization of the West
                            Berlin situation on the basis of such a settlement could not injure
                            anyone. Everybody would gain from a solution of this problem on that
                            basis, and particularly the cause of peace. Whatever concessions, if the
                            term concession could be used at all, that the West would make would be
                            not to the U.S.S.R. but to the cause of world peace, and that would be a
                            significant concession indeed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> had failed to answer his question. He asked
                            again whether the Soviet Union believed it had formal obligations to the
                            Western Powers with regard to the presence of Western forces in Berlin
                            and with regard to access.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asserted that he had
                            answered the question.</p>
                        <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0405"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that leaving aside whether the Soviet Union wanted to
                            change the situation, he wanted a yes or no answer to his question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that, briefly
                            speaking, the Soviet Union believed that the occupation regime in West
                            Berlin with all of its attributes had outlived itself. Seventeen years
                            had passed since World War II and that regime must be ended. This was
                            required by the U.S.S.R., it was needed by the U.S. and it was needed by
                            all countries. The U.S. should not look for any devious motives behind
                            this position. The Soviet Union was against basing foreign policy on
                            such motives and if anybody did so it was not the U.S.S.R. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said he wanted to ask the
                            Secretary a question of his own. He wondered why the West believed it
                            needed a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military base in West
                            Berlin and where were U.S. vital interests in that connection. After
                            all, the U.S. was here and West Berlin was there. As to what the
                            Secretary called freedom of West Berlin, the Soviet Union had suggested
                            that a joint agreement be signed to guarantee West Berlin’s way of life.
                            But the U.S. did not want to do this; it seemed not to trust its
                            prestige and might which would underlie such an agreement. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wondered what was wrong with
                            this suggestion; after all, all of the great powers and, if necessary,
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would back up such guarantee.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested to take the peels off the banana and to look at
                            the heart of the matter. The Soviet Union was a great power and so was
                            the United States. We were in West Berlin, although one could not talk
                            in terms of eternity, which was a fiction in the Soviet mind. At
                            pres-ent we were in West Berlin and we would not be driven out. We were
                            a great power and we would not accept defeat unless the U.S.S.R. fought
                            a war and attempted to defeat us. This was not a threat, it was a fact,
                            since we were committed to the people of West Berlin. The Soviet
                            Government and the Central Committee must consider this. The U.S. wanted
                            to resolve this problem peacefully, but it could not be resolved
                            peacefully on the basis of U.S. defeat. Solution to this problem must be
                            sought on the basis of a mutual recognition of the vital interests of
                            both sides and on the basis of mutual respect. We had gone a long way to
                            recognize the vital interests of the U.S.S.R., and the U.S.S.R. must
                            recognize ours. There was a point beyond which lay surrender and we
                            could not go beyond that point. The Soviet people were courageous, but
                            so were the American people. What we asked for was mutual respect, and
                            without that there could be no peace.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he agreed with
                            the Secretary’s remark about mutual respect. He thought this was a good
                            formula; agreement must be sought on the basis of mutual respect.
                            However, the Soviet Union could not find such respect on the part of the
                            U.S. The Secretary’s remark indicated that the U.S. wished to adhere to
                            a one-sided position. It wished to <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384"
                                facs="0406"/>preserve the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            military base in West Berlin and to preserve Western forces in West
                            Berlin, although U.S. interests in this connection were not guided by
                            the interests of maintaining the freedom of West Berlin or of
                            safeguarding U.S. security. What the U.S. wanted was to maintain the
                            hotbed of fever which was shaking all of Europe. He wondered where was
                            mutual respect here. The Soviet Union had no desire of placing the U.S.
                            in a position of capitulation, and the Secretary had incorrectly
                            described the Soviet position. Quite the contrary, the Soviet Union
                            believed that the U.S. was a great power. The U.S.S.R. was also a great
                            power and had considerable strength. The President and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khru-shchev</persName> had had a frank exchange of
                            views on this point. However, the U.S. position on West Berlin did not
                            indicate that the U.S. recognized this fact and that it based its policy
                            on it. The U.S. had consistently been shying away from any proposal
                            based on the interests of peace and respect for the sovereignty of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Thus, the Secretary’s reproach
                            that the U.S.S.R. wanted to place the U.S. in a position of surrender
                            was inaccurate. The U.S. position only strengthened the Soviet Union’s
                            view that a solution of this problem was required by the security of the
                            U.S.S.R. and many other states, by the security interests of all of
                            Europe, and indeed of the U.S. itself. The U.S.S.R. was convinced that
                            this was so. The U.S.S.R. and many other states wanted to draw a line
                            under World War II. The Central Committee and other leading bodies in
                            the U.S.S.R. had discussed the probable motives by which the U.S. was
                            guided in clinging to West Berlin as a military base. United States
                            security interests were certainly not among those motives. Thus, the
                            conclusion had been drawn that the U.S. wished to retain West Berlin as
                            a hotbed of tensions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> had greatly distorted this question. The fact
                            was that on one side the U.S.S.R. wanted to raise its flag in East
                            Berlin and East Germany and on the other side it wanted to lower our
                            flag in West Berlin. That was totally unacceptable. The U.S.S.R. was in
                            East Germany only because of the Nazi surrender. We had voluntarily
                            abandoned Thuringia and Saxony to abide by the arrangements concluded
                            during the war. We would not allow a situation where the Soviet Union
                            would abandon its responsibilities and obligations in Germany. The
                            Soviet Union must reckon with our vital interests. After all, we were
                            not children, we were adults.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that the
                            Soviet Union did not place this problem in the plane of the U.S.
                            allowing or not allowing something. The U.S.S.R. proceeded from
                            objective realities, which were not contingent upon U.S. actions. The
                            U.S.S.R. did not intend to raise its flag, it only wished to raise the
                            flag of peace. The Soviet Union had never signed any obligation
                            providing for the West’s eternally staying in West Berlin and
                            maintaining a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base there. Nobody
                            in his right mind could have assumed such an obligation. In fact, there
                            was no such obligation. It was <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0407"
                            />the U.S. and its allies who had torn up their obligation and wished to
                            keep only those obligations which were advantageous to them while
                            discarding those which were not to their liking.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then expressed regret
                            that no agreement was discernible on the main question. This was clear
                            from the present exchange of views, and he agreed with the Secretary on
                            this point. This was a regrettable and sad situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the basic problem remained where it had been
                            since 1945, namely, whether the Soviet Union was willing to conduct its
                            foreign policy on the basis of its solemn obligations and agreements or
                            wanted to resort to the law of jungle. The U.S. wished a peaceful
                            settlement, and there was no question about that. If such a settlement
                            should prove impossible, the U.S. would not shirk its responsibilities.
                            The Secretary then reiterated that we had gone a long way to resolve
                            this question and all other questions relating to a German settlement,
                            although our efforts to bring the positions of the two sides closer
                            together had caused tensions with some of our allies. He wished to
                            stress that the heart of the matter was whether the U.S.S.R. would
                            recognize that the U.S. was a great power and could not be pushed
                            around. He could assure Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> that the U.S. public would not be pushed around.
                            Surely, agreement could be reached on the basis of reciprocity, but
                            without reciprocity there was no possibility of agreement. So long as
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> was President and he,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, Secretary of State,
                            there would be no possibility of agreement without reciprocity.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> contended the
                            Secretary’s reproach regarding Soviet policy since World War II was
                            unjustified. The Soviet Union had carried the main burden in that war,
                            and many U.S. statesmen, including President Roosevelt, had correctly
                            and objectively appreciated the Soviet Union’s role and its burden in
                            defeating the Nazis.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary interjected that the Soviet-Hitler agreement had opened the
                            door to World War II, so that not too many tears should be shed over
                            that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> responded that this
                            was an old story resorted to by people when they lost their equilibrium,
                            and suggested that no time be wasted on this point.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that the U.S. had never been an ally of Hitler,
                            whereas the U.S.S.R. had in 1939–1940.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued that the
                            aspersions the Secretary attempted to cast on Soviet policy were
                            unjustified. It was not the U.S.S.R. but the West that had built bases
                            surrounding the territories of other states, it was not the U.S.S.R. but
                            the West that had started raising tensions, and it was not the USSR but
                            the West that had torn up agreements. Thus, if the term law of jungle
                            could be applied, it was the U.S. that had <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386"
                                facs="0408"/>resorted to it in many instances since World War II.
                            The Secretary was incorrect in saying that the U.S.S.R. was not dealing
                            on the basis of reciprocity. The Secretary’s assertion could not be
                            proven in one single instance. The Soviet Union had emphasized and
                            suggested that solutions should be sought on the basis of mutual
                            acceptability and complete equality of both sides. The U.S. was for the
                            observance of this principle only in words, whereas in fact it had a
                            narrow view of problems and looked at them from the standpoint of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Western Powers. The U.S.
                            rejected almost automatically and out of hand Soviet proposals so long
                            as it was able to retain West Berlin as a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> military base.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that in general
                            he wanted to tell the Secretary that solution to the various problems
                            could not be found on the basis of strong language; one must be more
                            reasonable and cooler, because much was behind words and much depended
                            on what one said. If the Secretary and the President sought common
                            ground with the Soviet Union, they would find no lack of similar desire
                            on the part of the Soviet Union. However, unfortunately as of now the
                            Secretary’s remarks did not indicate that the U.S. wished to pursue this
                            course. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> recalled that
                            he stressed to the President today the Soviet view that it would be good
                            if common language could be found between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. on
                            questions dividing them, including the question of a German peace treaty
                            and of normalizing the West Berlin situation on the basis of such a
                            treaty. He observed that apparently this conversation was drawing to an
                            end.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>’s last formulation was the same as the one used
                            in Vienna in 1961, i.e., “German peace treaty and normalization of the
                            West Berlin situation on the basis of such a treaty.” He regretted that
                            not more progress had been achieved, pointing out that the U.S. had
                            tried to meet the U.S.S.R. on many questions involved in this problem.
                            As to the main question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khru-shchev</persName> must decide on what basis they were prepared
                            to reach agreement. We knew on what basis we were prepared to reach
                            agreement. The Soviet Union must decide whether there would be peace or
                            not. We believed that all nations must live on the basis of peace, and
                            if the U.S.S.R. joined <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members and
                            lived in peace, that would revolutionize the world and there would be no
                            problem with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that we would follow up on the points Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had mentioned and try
                            to narrow the differences. We had tried to narrow the differences in the
                            past and would continue to do so in the future, in the hope that common
                            language could be found. The Secretary then recalled Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s remark to one of his
                            visitors that the <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> talks would produce no progress
                            and that the situation would remain more or less as it was. The
                            Secretary regretted that no particular progress on this problem had been
                            made during Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s <pb
                                n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0409"/>stay in the U.S., and stated
                            that both sides must see whether they could bring these matters closer
                            to agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> expressed doubt that
                            the Secretary had any reason to equate U.S. policy with the sentiments
                            of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members. He thought that the
                            Secretary had attempted to place such a sign of equation. The Soviet
                            Union was familiar with the sentiments in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and believed that the overwhelming majority of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members favored a peaceful and just
                            solution of acute international problems. Those feelings were not in
                            accord with U.S. policy on most acute problems. Thus, the Secretary’s
                            attempt to equate U.S. policy with those feelings was unjustified. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then thanked the
                            Secretary for the dinner and his hospitality.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that, to his recollection, not a single
                            proposal or resolution advanced in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            by the U.S.S.R. against opposition by the U.S. had succeeded or been
                            adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agreed and said that
                            the Soviet Union was also familiar with the weaknesses and the darker
                            aspects of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> activities. However, he was
                            speaking of the general feeling of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            members, who were in favor of peaceful solution of international
                            problems, of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states,
                            and of peaceful coexistence. This fact was as unquestionable as the fact
                            that the sun would rise tomorrow. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> concluded the conversation by saying that he
                            merely wished to point out that no sign of equation could be placed
                            between U.S. policy and the sentiments of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> members. Any attempt to do so was a little too much.</p>
                        <p>The conversation ended at 12:20 a.m.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary has approved the Task Force’s proposal to have the

                            for handling the Berlin operation with a view to tightening the plans
                            and assuring that the machinery can provide the most effective responses
                            to Soviet moves in Berlin. (The approved Task force paper is
                            attached.)</p>
                        <p>Despite last week’s loud cries and complaints about our paper<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d137fn1">Not further identified.</note> describing the state
                            of contingency planning, a good part of the contents of that paper are
                            reproduced in the approved Task Force document.</p>
                        <p>This exercise could produce useful results. I am not sure about the
                            recommendations dealing with the single Commander in Berlin and a single
                            Ambassador in Bonn. Something more positive and specific is needed in
                            Berlin. The problem of a single Ambassador is far more complicated than
                            the paper indicates. But we will deal with these as we go along in the
                            exercise.</p>
                        <p>An important question, however, is how this set of proposals fits into
                            the broader scenario which you had in mind. On this we need a reading
                            from you on how this Ambassadorial exercise can be dovetailed with other
                            contemplated actions. One exercise need not exclude the other, but it is
                            important that they reinforce each other. Can we get a reading from you
                            on this?</p>

                            <p>This paper examines three key aspects of planning: (1) organization,
                                (2) planning, and (3) delegation of authority. Organization is the
                                key to the preparation of plans and their application to specific
                                situations by the person to whom authority is delegated. Planning is
                                the key to the delegation of authority. Delegation of authority
                                (advance commitments by government) is the key to rapid response to
                                specific situations.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Organization</hi></p>
                            <p>The present organization for the Berlin problem is illustrated by the
                                attached chart (Tab A).<note n="4" xml:id="d137fn4">Not
                                    found.</note> This, however, over-simplifies the problem, since
                                it implies that Berlin, Bonn, and Washington are organized on the
                                same basis as Live Oak. This is, however, not the case.</p>
                            <p>Live Oak is an integrated, full-time staff, with one man in
                                charge.</p>
                            <p>Berlin is run by three Commandants, with the help of a Governing
                                Mayor. Although there is a Chairman Commandant, he has no authority
                                to deal with most of the problems which arise in Berlin or on the
                                access routes. Although there is provision for a single commander in
                                event of “any grave emergency,” the staff that is supposed to assist
                                him—the Allied (Military) Staff—would be competent to handle only
                                certain problems, such as civil unrest and an armed attack.</p>
                            <p>Berlin problems are handled in Bonn by the Foreign Office and three
                                Ambassadors, assisted by a part-time quadripartite committee.</p>
                            <p>Although the Washington Ambassadorial Group is led by the US
                                Chairman, it has no full-time quadripartite staff. The sub-groups
                                are staffed by very few officers, particularly as far as the
                                Embassies are concerned, who often have other duties and are
                                invariably over-worked. Furthermore, the Ambassadorial Group (State
                                Department) is not tied in with the Live Oak communications
                                system.</p>
                            <p>If maximum improvements were desired in this organization, the
                                following steps should be taken: <list>

                                can be fully effective without the other; on the other hand, we
                                believe that some improvements should be possible at this time.</p>

                            <p>The chart also indicates that delegations of authority are primarily
                                related to military plans (Jack Pine and autobahn convoy rules of
                                conduct). Very little authority has been delegated in the
                                non-military areas, primarily because governments are unwilling.</p>
                            <p>Both planning and the delegation of authority could be facilitated if
                                the organizational suggestions made above were carried out. If there
                                were agreement for the President to appoint a Single Commander in
                                Berlin and a Single Ambassador in Bonn, plans could be prepared on
                                the basis of the assumption that they would exercise certain
                                delegated authority. This would require, however, that the Single
                                Commander and Single Ambassador have full-time staffs, supported by
                                adequate facilities and communications.</p>

                        <p>[Here follows discussion of Cuba.]</p>
                        <p><persName>M. Winckler</persName>: What is your assumption on possible
                            reaction in Berlin?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName>: One of the
                            possible ways in which the Soviets might choose to react would be
                            through measures in Berlin, as for example by harassment, possibly just
                            against the U.S., possibly of a wider scope. However, Berlin isn’t the
                            only place in which they might choose to react.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: They have several
                            alternatives. One of the reasons for the use of “quarantine” and not
                            “blockade” is to avoid the connection which <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> is trying to make between Cuba and
                            Berlin.</p>
                        <p><persName>M. Winckler</persName>: Is your assumption now, considering the
                            present balance of forces, that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> will not move in Berlin?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: I think it is wholly
                            accurate to say that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            stated more forcefully than has been done before the Soviet intention to
                            proceed in Berlin.</p>
                        <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0415"/>
                        <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName>: Regarding the Soviet
                            promise not to act on Berlin before the U.S. elections, they said,
                            “unless the U.S. acts”. This is the “unless”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: It has become clear
                            what they meant by holding off until the U.S. elections. Would it not be
                            useful for us to explore in this group what we judge Soviet intentions
                            are in the steps they have taken?</p>
                        <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName>: Any statements I could
                            make would be off the top of my head.</p>
                        <p>M. Winckler: I think it would be a profitable thing to do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: I can give only my
                            personal feelings, but from a long range point of view the Soviet
                            intention could be to secure the removal of U.S. forces from overseas
                            bases, which would include Western forces in Berlin. As an intermediate
                            goal, the Soviets may be seeking to put pressure on the Alliance
                            structure in the hope of producing fissures in it. The U.S., of course,
                            has been under <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>’s for some time,
                            but this Soviet move in Cuba is a very extreme one. It changes the
                            balance of power.</p>
                        <p>M. Winckler: This is a pretty big gamble.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: Yes, it is a quantum
                            jump on <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s part. This
                            suggests to me, personally, if the crisis has been stepped up by this
                            quantum jump, that the perspective in which to view some of the issues
                            before this group has changed and some of the issues have become minor
                            to the extent that we ought to settle them quickly or forget about them,
                            and also that we have got to deal with some of the major issues. A
                            failure to act is dangerous, and we might proceed on the basis that (a)
                            we must have unity in the Alliance, (b) minor issues must be disposed
                            of, and (c) we must deal with the major issues with both caution and
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>As to the tactical reasons behind this Soviet move, some have suggested
                            that it was necessary to keep the momentum of Soviet leadership. This I
                            regard as questionable, although you may remember the report of a Soviet
                            Ambassador stating to someone that he had seen the Soviet plans for
                            Berlin and they now meet the Chinese criteria. It is possible that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s interests in
                            Latin America are behind this move, and that this is a major ploy in
                            this direction. He may be thinking of setting up a negotiating position.
                            Again, he might have contingent objectives, and depending on our
                            reaction, may pursue one or another.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows additional discussion of Cuba.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Schnippenkoetter</persName>: I have two points. First, are
                            the number of topics to be discussed between Washington and Moscow now
                            wider than before: What does this mean for Berlin? Is Berlin being put
                            aside, or does it come into sharper focus in this situation?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: We can’t tell until we
                            see what the Soviets say.</p>
                        <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName>: Or, even more
                            important, what they do.</p>
                        <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0416"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: I would say that high
                            on the list of probabilities, is some move in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName>: I agree.</p>
                        <p><persName>M. Winckler</persName>: I think this means that we must move on
                            such matters as alerts, etc.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: I think it is fair to
                            expect that our business here will boom.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Schnippenkoetter</persName>: My second point is that Berlin
                            contingency plans have been made in a context which was principally
                            limited to Berlin. Does the new picture which emerges from these actions
                            taken by your government alter the general nature of our plans? Does
                            this place new restraints on these plans or will this situation speed
                            them up and strengthen them?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: Our planning has been
                            based on the development of a crisis, and although the initiation of the
                            crisis could be in Berlin, our planning has proceeded beyond that
                            immediate area. I would therefore say that the basis for our planning
                            has been sound and is not overturned by these recent events. (Discussion
                            then halted so that the group could listen to the President’s speech. At
                            the end of the speech, there was no further group discussion and the
                            meeting adjourned at 7:20 P.M.)</p>

                            <item>The critical factor, however, is not physical or economic but
                                psychological. Everything would depend on the context of the Soviet
                                move, and how quickly and forcefully the US reacted. A total and
                                uncontested blockade would cause the West Berliners to lose all hope
                                in a matter of weeks. A blockade contested by a successful airlift
                                would probably relieve initial apprehension and sustain morale for a
                                few months. Over a longer period, however, morale would deteriorate
                                rapidly in the absence of a reasonable expectation that the US would
                                break the blockade. The West Berliners would become extraordinarily
                                sensitive to, and suspicious of any indication from either side that
                                the Cuban crisis might produce an accommodation at their
                                expense.</item>

                            may blame the US for the Berlin crisis), the US should emphasize that
                            the Soviet actions in Cuba led to a heightened Berlin crisis, and that
                            if we had not acted toward the current Cuban situation the Berlin crisis
                            would have been much worse. Consensus was to conduct a background

                            occasion to complain to Foreign Minister or other appropriate official
                            how this Government has viewed Soviet policy with respect to Cuban
                            crisis.</p>
                        <p>Beginning in middle of summer, there were a number of indications that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> and Soviet
                            Government had concluded there was <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398"
                                facs="0420"/>no possibility Soviet Union could obtain its objectives
                            with respect to Berlin through negotiation. There were also indications
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> felt too
                            personally committed to achievement of his objectives in Berlin to
                            retreat, as well as indications that factors which were pushing Soviet
                            Government to a resolution of this problem were increasing (situation in
                            East Germany, Communist Chinese pressure, etc.) and that Soviet Union
                            had decided showdown on Berlin problem was inevitable within some
                            months. There were also indications that Soviet Government and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> personally had developed
                            doubts as to whether they could win in a showdown and that alternatives
                            might be either an ignominious retreat or nuclear war.</p>
                        <p>Soviet Government privately and later publicly stated that while it would
                            insist upon conclusive discussion of Berlin problem in relatively short
                            period, it would not do so until after American Congressional elections.
                            It maintained this position even though it was made clear to them that
                            so far as US Government concerned, elections had no bearing on the
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>A number of assurances were given by Soviet Government both privately and
                            publicly that it would not arm Cuba with offensive weapons. This was not
                            merely dialectical discussion but specific assurances against weapons
                            that could reach the US. <gloss target="#t_TASS1">Tass</gloss> statement
                            of September 11 said that Soviet Union had no need to take such action.
                            This statement, which was largely concerned with Cuban situation,
                            related it to question of German peace treaty and other international
                            problems.</p>

                            about Cuba: Soviet assistance to Cuba “pursued solely the purpose of
                            contributing to the defense capabilities of Cuba”; that “training by
                            Soviet specialists of Cuban nationals in handling defensive armaments
                            was by no means offensive” and that “if it were otherwise, the Soviet
                            Government would have never become involved in rendering such
                            assistance.”</p>

                        <p>To concede to the Soviets a right on which we have continuously and
                            strenuously insisted during nearly two decades would constitute a marked
                            softening of the Allied position concerning Berlin. Implicit in the
                            right to examine cargo, the Soviets would argue, is the right to
                            determine what sort of cargo may enter. Soviet efforts to assert such
                            rights would infringe upon vital Allied interests regarding the presence
                            and security of Allied forces in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The Berlin population would be seriously upset if the Allies were to
                            allow examination of land cargoes, but they would be deprived of the
                            foundation of their sense of freedom if the Soviets were permitted to
                            examine Allied air traffic. It is the West Berliner’s ability to fly in
                            and out of West Berlin completely free of any Soviet or <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> inspection that sustains him
                            psychologically.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the relationship with the Cuba quarantine, it would be a good
                            thing indeed to know that the Soviets would have no other reaction than
                            a demand to inspect Berlin traffic. But how could one count on it? What
                            justification would there be for believing, and for assuring Allied
                            populations and the West Berliners, that this represented the final
                            slice of salami rather than one more slice among many?</p>
                        <p>If the Soviets were allowed to inspect the cargoes, they could later turn
                            this “right” over to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, thus
                            extending in a major way the de facto sovereignty of the <gloss

                        <p>The quadripartite Allies have quite recently reconfirmed the
                            long-standing Allied position on refusing Soviet examination of
                            cargo.</p>
                        <p>As the US has forcefully and publicly proclaimed, no logical connection
                            exists between a free West Berlin whose people want Allied troops on
                            hand and a Cuba whose subjugated people want Soviet forces and weapons
                            to leave. To make such a trade-off as is suggested would corrupt this
                            main element of the US political case.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Department of Defense has prepared in broad outline a plan for the
                            buildup and deployment of forces which is contemplated, if and as
                            required, in Phase II of a Berlin contingency as described in <gloss
                                target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss>-109.<note n="1" xml:id="d143fn1"><ref

                                185</ref>.</note> It is based on the projection of information
                            provided by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and has been coordinated
                            informally with the Department of State. It does not yet, however,
                            constitute a governmental position.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the plan is to make available on call varying levels of
                            augmentation of forces, and to make possible rapid deployments, which
                            will be appropriate to the degree of threat posed by Soviet action, and
                            to provide alternatives to piecemeal expediency or premature general
                            mobilization. It is intended to provide necessary forces, and their
                            support, to meet a developing situation, and to deny to the Soviets the
                            advantage of the accordion tactic of forcing us to oscillate between the
                            extremes of normal readiness and all-out mobilization, with the severe
                            national disruption this would entail.</p>
                        <p>The plan is divided into four increments, each of which, if ordered
                            directly into effect, would encompass all the provisions of the
                            preceding increment(s). There is no built-in automaticity, however,
                            which would require implementation of a later increment if the previous
                            one has proved sufficient to the need.</p>
                        <p>Each increment includes appropriate reserve alert and call-up and
                            logistic measures. The first increment provides the heaviest force
                            increase (a Corps force of 3 Army divisions, 1 Marine Division/Wing Team
                            with amphibious task force, 10 Air Force Fighter Squadrons and naval
                            units), the second a lesser ground force but more naval and air force (2
                            Army divisions, 1 Marine Division/Wing Team with amphibious task force,
                            the US 2nd Fleet, and up to 25 TAC fighter squadrons with necessary
                            combat and logistic support forces), the third includes 1 Army division
                            force, and the fourth calls for general mobilization. No <pb n="402"
                                xml:id="pg_402" facs="0424"/>increment is directly dependent on any
                            pre-set date or event for its execution but can be implemented when
                            required. Each increment requires approximately 30 days for execution of
                            the measures which it contains; execution of the increments in
                            succession, if so ordered, is on a cumulative time scale.</p>
                        <p>Although the buildup and deployment plan is primarily oriented toward
                            Berlin, it is adaptable in appreciable measure to a crisis anywhere and
                            at any time. For instance, in the present Cuban context there remain
                            substantial US strategic reserves to reinforce Europe on schedule by
                            utilizing expanded commercial air and sea lift. Without regard to the
                            timing of Cuban contingency plans, a modified first increment would
                            include two Army Divisions forces slated to “marry up” with the
                            equipment already positioned for them in Europe, a third Army division
                            without support elements and 10 TAC Fighter Squadrons released from the
                            Cuban contingency or mobilized from the reserves.</p>
                        <p>It would be useful if the corresponding plans of our Berlin partners
                            could be generally built on the same incremental framework as our own.
                            This would ensure that our mutual plans dovetail as closely as possible
                            so as to present a united deterrent if the necessity to implement them
                            should arise. It would, in addition, facilitate development of similar
                            plans by the remaining <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies, and
                            lend added emphasis to the message conveyed to the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>In order to undertake discussions in the Quadripartite Military Sub-Group
                            directed toward this end, authority is therefore requested to discuss on
                            a no-commitment basis with the representatives of France, the Federal
                            Republic of Germany, and the United Kingdom this general outline plan as
                            discussed above, and to solicit from them their plans, in turn, for
                            discussion ad referendum. Plans will be referred to the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff for comment and concurrence prior to progressing beyond the
                            informal discussion stage in the Quadripartite Military Sub-Group.</p>
                        <p>A supporting study is being prepared which assesses the implications for
                            the budget and the Balance of Payments.</p>

                            <item>The Soviets might now—conceivably—push hard on Berlin to offset
                                their Cuban losses.</item>

                            <item>On balance, however, this seems doubtful. A move against Berlin
                                would ultimately end in negotiations (unless the Soviets wanted to
                                resort to the use of force, which hardly seems likely, at least
                                under current Kremlin management). And this is not the most
                                propitious time for the Soviets to enter into negotiations on
                                Berlin. Therefore, if all other things remain equal, admittedly a
                                large assumption, we should not have an early major push on
                                Berlin.</item>

                            <item>The question then is whether we should not try to take the

                            <item>In many ways this is a good time for us, particularly if Cuba is
                                settled on the terms that now seem likely. Our bargaining position
                                is incomparably better than it was several weeks back. And since we
                                would be negotiating from greater strength, we would have a greater
                                degree of maneuverability than we have had at any time since
                                1953.</item>

                                as a means to recover some of the substantial ground he lost by his
                                Cuban adventure.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>If all this is so, might we not try to see what kind of an
                                arrangement we would want in Berlin—an arrangement that was also
                                saleable to the Soviets—and let the Soviets know what was possible.
                                In this connection, a reexamination of the 10-point declaration
                                might be a useful starting point for an internal U.S. exercise which
                                should be fully completed before it is discussed anywhere
                                else.</item>

                            policy with respect to Cuban crisis, concluding that in general terms US
                            tends to believe Soviet action was probably primarily geared to showdown
                            on Berlin, intended to be timed with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s arrival in US and completion of
                            installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba. Following comments are
                            designed to expand somewhat on this general concept as well as to assess
                            possible Soviet resort to “adjustments” in plans for Berlin stemming
                            from US action to eliminate Soviet missile bases. You should draw <pb

                            as guidance for comments in October 30 meeting.</p>
                        <p>General credibility. You should emphasize that in view of previous clear
                            statements that US could not tolerate Soviet offensive-type missile
                            deployment in Cuba, these missiles must obviously be eliminated if US
                            determination to honor commitments, including those concerning Berlin,
                            is to remain credible throughout world. Allies appreciate US firmness is
                            cornerstone their defense against Soviet aggression. Equally important,
                            however, USSR must fully realize there exists no basis for
                            miscalculation of US intentions. Otherwise, gravest possible risk of war
                            might arise from Soviet underestimation US resolve to maintain vital
                            interests of Alliance in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Military significance. You should also emphasize that Soviet nuclear
                            missile bases in Cuba are not just another complex of overseas bases.
                            These bases have special significance since missiles based in USSR and
                            targeted on US nuclear forces are still relatively few in number. In
                            addition, we have radar systems which pick up missiles coming over
                            ice-cap from Soviet Union. The limitations on Soviet intercontinental
                            ballistic missile capability provides West with margin of nuclear
                            superiority which is heart of Western deterrent. If Soviets had been
                            permitted to complete substantial missile program in Cuba, balance of
                            nuclear power could have been significantly shifted. IRBM’s in Cuba
                            would be free of radar detection and with zero alert time both <gloss
                                target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites and <gloss target="#t_SAC1"
                                >SAC</gloss> bases could come under attack without warning and with
                            greater accuracy due to short range. This could seriously prejudice US
                            nuclear posture and with first strike from Cuba Soviets could seriously
                            impair US capability to cover all necessary targets.</p>
                        <p>Timing. Obviously Soviet timetable for Berlin showdown upset by US
                            action. Now remains to be seen whether Soviets will attempt to move
                            against Allied interests in Berlin, as expected by <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. If Soviets now reduced from what we
                            estimated to be larger objectives to level of harassments they may
                            choose to engage in harassment before Cuban missile sites are
                            liquidated. Should Soviet Berlin action be directed mainly at US we
                            would expect full Alliance support. In this respect <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has indicated it would consider Soviet
                            action against US traffic as an action against Allied traffic as a
                            whole.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The principal item on the agenda was maintaining the momentum of the
                            Cuban development, with specific attention to the question of
                            strengthening <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the next steps
                            in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the meeting <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Paul
                                Nitze</persName> suggested, and it was agreed, that insofar as
                            Berlin was concerned, the next step was to examine possible arrangements
                            which would stabilize the Berlin situation for a substantial period, and
                            the tactical means for bringing this about. A primary consideration is
                            to reach such arrangement without, if possible, forcing a direct
                            U.S.-USSR military confrontation.</p>
                        <p>Although Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> went
                            along with the proposed course of action on the understanding that the
                            strictest security would be maintained, he clearly was out of sympathy
                            with the project as proposed. He said that he was reluctant to touch
                            Berlin at this time lest the Soviets become concerned that we were
                            intent upon pushing them—and this time on a very vital issue for the
                            Kremlin. In this context Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                                >Thompson</persName> dwelled at length on the differences between
                            Cuba and Berlin in the Soviet view. Therefore he felt the immediate
                            point of departure and concentration on talks with the Soviets should be
                            disarmament or nuclear testing or non-aggression arrangements between
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw Pact, all of
                            which he believes would ultimately facilitate discussions on Berlin.
                            Moreover, he is concerned that if Berlin is brought under consideration
                            in the present climate, the Germans would push for a substantially
                            harder position than we would want to take.<note n="1" xml:id="d146fn1"

                                it appeared that the President believed the United States could push
                                its Allies harder following the Cuban crisis. (Department of State,

                        <p>598. Sovs must be convinced by this time we really mean that Allied
                            presence in Berlin is non-negotiable. If there to be further talks with
                            Sovs on Berlin, they may come round to recognize this fact, implicitly
                            if not explicitly. While we no doubt prefer press consistent Allied
                            position based on preserving Four-Power status and working out new
                            access arrangements, might be good idea be prepared with alternative
                            package if Sovs show interest in face-saving compromise. Sovs might well
                            refuse discuss any such proposal but suggested approach and reasoning
                            that follows is designed give Sovs chance claim progress toward their
                            goals and at same time maintain our vital interests.</p>
                        <p>Our insistence on Allied presence does not stem from obsolete desire
                            maintain wartime military government in Berlin. We too interested in
                            drawing line under World War II, without abandoning objective of
                            reunited Germany or obligation protect freedom West Berlin. In order
                            narrow difference between us, might find way to end occupation regime
                            and put Allied troops in West Berlin on contractual basis following
                            example Sov troops East Germany. Our troops must remain in order fulfill
                            commitment to defend West Berlin but Sov abandonment responsibilities
                            over East Berlin suggests need for adjustments in West Berlin. Allies
                            accordingly might give up wartime powers and sovereignty in West Berlin
                            except obligation to defend city.</p>
                        <p>Question arises as to where sovereignty would then rest. It could not be
                            given up to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> nor to free city, i.e.
                            third division of Germany. Only logical place for West Berlin, pending
                            reunification of Germany, would be for it to join that part of Germany
                            which has same political, economic and social system, i.e. <gloss
                                target="#t_FEDREP1">FedRep</gloss>. Allies therefore should withdraw
                            reservation to full association of West Berlin with <gloss
                                target="#t_FEDREP1">FedRep</gloss>. This reservation was made on
                            assumption Sov Government was committed to reunification of Germany on
                            basis of free elections, an assumption which since 1958 has lost its
                            validity through unilateral actions by USSR. At same time Allies would
                            make contractual arrangement with <gloss target="#t_FEDREP1"
                                >FedRep</gloss> by which they would retain task of continuing to
                            ensure freedom and defense of West Berlin. In short, Allies would give
                            up sovereignty and all functions of military government except defense
                            which would include ultimate control over West Berlin police forces.</p>

                        <p>A new status for Allied presence in West Berlin and for West Berlin
                            itself must meet squarely the problem of relations with East Berlin
                            regime and access to Berlin. Admitting that there are many contacts with
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> at present especially among
                            Germans and that such relations are bound to increase over the years,
                            Allies might well accept same controls in traveling to and from Berlin
                            that Germans accept, provided free access for both Allied and German
                            traffic is guaranteed. This could be done through a quadipartite
                            commitment and international access and control authority which would
                            also have to be underwritten by <gloss target="#t_FEDREP1"
                                >FedRep</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>To make this proposal more acceptable to Soviets it is assumed we would
                            be willing to go quite a distance to meet their demands for recognition
                            of Oder-Neisse line, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw
                            non-aggression pact, and non-diffusion of nuclear weapons. In addition
                            we might, pending reunification of Germany, give de facto recognition to
                            incorporation of East Berlin into East German state. Might also consider
                            willingness have Federal Republic modify Hallstein doctrine.</p>
                        <p>In suggesting foregoing, part of which inspired by Senator Schiller’s
                            proposal in connection with plebiscite (conversation with
                                <persName>Franklin Roosevelt</persName>), assumption is made that
                            Allies would reaffirm in clearest way possible their guarantee to defend
                            Berlin. There might be some difficulty in defining responsibilities of
                            Allies and those of German authorities under contractual arrangement,
                            but it should be possible to assure overriding authority of Allies in
                            all defense matters both in planning and in emergencies. This might even
                            require closer working relations with German authorities than exist at
                            present in military and police field. Allies would cease to deal with
                            practically all activities that come under Kommandatura. Reorganization
                            on Allied side might even contemplate integrated command.</p>
                        <p>If at any stage in discussions it would seem useful to suggest that
                            Allied forces under contract to protect Berlin might be constabulary
                            rather than army forces, I assume this would make very little difference
                            to us. We could probably only agree to do this in name as in fact they
                            would remain military units.</p>
                        <p>It is recognized that this proposal means giving up Four-Power status
                            which is legal basis for our presence in Berlin. The question is whether
                            gains outweigh this legal disadvantage.</p>
                        <p>This proposal would undoubtedly be hailed as step toward recognition of
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. However, many people including
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> and I hope <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> himself recognize that we must
                            take certain chances in this direction and be willing to make certain de
                            facto arrangements. Modification Hallstein doctrine might permit <gloss
                                target="#t_FEDREP1">FedRep</gloss> to establish diplomatic <pb
                                n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0432"/>relations with Poland,
                            Czechoslavakia, etc., without affecting policies three Allies and <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> toward de jure recognition.</p>
                        <p>Proposal may be interpreted as attempt by Allies to pave way for ultimate
                            withdrawing from their Berlin commitments. It cannot disguise fact
                            Germans would be taking on powers formerly held by Allies. Berlin Senat
                            might welcome greater autonomy but there probably would be real problem
                            overcoming widespread German anxieties. Major effort would be required
                            to show that contractual agreement to defend city affords adequate
                            protection.</p>
                        <p>Sovs might of course refuse to discuss any plan that incorporated West
                            Berlin in <gloss target="#t_FEDREP1">FedRep</gloss>. In that case we
                            would at least have shown our reasonableness and fact we not wedded to
                            status quo. It would appear as serious offer to end what must seem to
                            many people, particularly in uncommitted countries, to be anachronistic
                            prolongation of military occupation.</p>
                        <p>Mission’s earlier suggestions to make Berlin eleventh Land were conceived
                            of as unilateral actions to improve Western bargaining position or as
                            retaliation against some major Sov harassment or against a separate
                            peace treaty. Senator Schiller’s recent suggestion which included
                            contractual basis for Allied forces was proposed as question to be put
                            to West Berlin people in plebiscite. New suggestion is based on thought
                            it might be put up as part of package to the Russians for negotiation,
                            since it goes considerable distance in meeting many of their demands. At
                            appropriate time some kind of plebiscite in West Berlin with reference
                            to this package might be desirable.</p>
                        <p>Before any such package could be mentioned to Sovs even as trial balloon
                            it would presumably have to be discussed with Brit, French and Germans.
                            This in itself could be delicate matter. Discussion among Germans would
                            reveal certain differences in outlook between <gloss target="#t_SPD1"
                                >SPD</gloss>-influenced Berlin and <gloss target="#t_CDU1"
                                >CDU</gloss>-influenced Bonn govt recognition, ties, access, etc.
                            (We submitting separate analysis this trend.) Hence believe somewhat
                            futile to expect much in way of new initiatives from Germans. As in past
                            new proposals unlikely to be made unless they originate from American
                            side.</p>

                        <p>I believe that we should make every effort in good time to find a
                            long-term solution to the Berlin question and, if possible, the German
                            question. Otherwise we may find ourselves someday in a Berlin crisis,
                            where we all will wish we had taken more radical measures to lance the
                            boil despite the recognized risks, costs and difficulties. The view of
                            others of the group is that the attached paper underestimates the
                            difficulties in arriving at long-term solutions and that there are
                            unwarranted dangers in considering what they believe to be impracticable

                            the problem of the inherent impossibility of being sure all warheads
                            have been destroyed. This might involve no more than 500 delivery
                            vehicles of our choice, with warheads of a yield aggregating no more
                            than 50 megatons, on our side, and an equal number and yield on their
                            side, with a complete prohibition on all other nuclear weapons, AICBM’s

                        <p>1. Agreement by the USSR and CPR to eschew any military connection with
                            this Hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>Such arrangements have been unthinkable in the past context. I believe
                            they could be to the interest of both the USSR and the U.S. If both
                            sides agreed that this was so, I do not think it impossible we could
                            bring them about. The competition between the Communist system and ours
                            would continue but on quite different terms than otherwise
                            foreseeable.</p>
                        <p>The above ideas ignore all the tactical problems. The tactical problems
                            are immense and undoubtedly would greatly modify even the substance of
                            any program of action. But one can’t start putting a program together
                            without some idea of the direction one wishes to go.</p>
                        <p>The relation of all this to Berlin is that Berlin has been a focal point
                            in the over-all Western confrontation with the Bloc. The long-term
                            solution of Berlin can hardly take place except as part of a general
                            readjustment of the terms of that confrontation.</p>

                                necessary within a reasonable period, and may be desirable. At a
                                Summit, Berlin would undoubtedly be an important item of discussion.
                                Such Berlin discussions would take place against a variety of
                                proposals from the U.S. and the Soviets on other items of importance
                                to one or both sides.</p>
                            <p>It follows that we need a theory of our Berlin interest from which a
                                variety of positions can be developed, depending upon the actual
                                setting which emerges and which is not now accurately
                                predictable.</p>
                            <p>It would be useful to have the broad lines of this theory tentatively

                                    through a traumatic exposure to the imminence of war, the
                                    relationship of the military situation to the political outcome,
                                    and the necessity for firm but moderate diplomacy. Its
                                    confidence in itself and its leadership has been enhanced. It
                                    does not, however, wish to live indefinitely with a series of
                                    Cubas, one of which might be in a less favorable geographic

                                    accidental aberration. Both this enhanced confidence and
                                    enhanced concern dispose the U.S. to take a firmer line with our
                                    Allies, where this is required to further our aims, as well as

                                        is whether the Soviets will have emerged from the Cuban
                                        experience with the feeling that avoidance of a comparable
                                        crisis over Berlin is paramount and that they must therefore
                                        be prepared to give on Berlin in light of demonstrated U.S.
                                        determination, or whether they will feel they must counter
                                        our Cuban success with gains of their own in Berlin or
                                        elsewhere. While there is great uncertainty as to the Soviet
                                        reaction, it probably combines a new wariness about U.S.
                                        response with a compulsion to recover lost prestige.</p>
                                    <p>At a minimum, the Soviets can probably be expected to take
                                        political and diplomatic steps to counter the effects of the
                                        Cuban back-down on the Soviet power image, and to disabuse
                                        the U.S. of any notion that tactics like those applied in
                                        the Cuban crisis can be used to force concessions from the
                                        Soviet Union on long-standing issues under dispute,
                                        including Berlin. We cannot exclude the possibility that
                                        they may feel driven to exert strong pressures in the
                                        reasonably near future.</p>

                                    <p>The Soviets may estimate that the Cuban crisis will open up
                                        room for maneuver. By making the danger of nuclear
                                        confrontation real and visceral for all the world, the
                                        crisis may seem to them to provide the catalyst needed to
                                        put new flexibility into the stalemated Berlin situation. It
                                        could create an environment where radical solutions are
                                        possible.</p>
                                    <p>The Soviet judgment of this possibility will probably be
                                        conditioned by their assessment of the U.S. temper. If the
                                        U.S. appears firm and sober after the crisis, and if
                                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> feels
                                        impelled to do something about Berlin in the near future, he
                                        may feel that serious negotiation at the Summit would be
                                        preferable to unilateral Soviet action.</p>
                                    <p>The Soviets may well be motivated toward a serious attempt to
                                        stabilize the situation, not only by the prospect of nuclear
                                        confrontation in a disadvantageous balance, but also by a
                                        real desire to focus on economic competition.</p>
                                    <p>The Soviets probably also face reappraisal of their strategic
                                        posture. It was an inadequate deterrent in Cuba; they may
                                        consider the alternatives of even more energetic efforts to
                                        redress the imbalance, or measures to reduce
                                        instabilities.</p>
                                    <p>Finally, having apparently misread our reactions in the Cuban
                                        case, the Soviets may confine themselves to highly tentative
                                        moves until they reassess the situation.</p></item>

                            <p>We should be able to brush aside trivial Allied objections and
                                reservations, and insist on concentrating on major issues.</p>
                            <p>At the same time, while the Allies supported our Cuban actions with
                                minimum consultation, we can expect increased sensitivity about
                                consultation in the future, both because the issues will be closer
                                to them and more within their responsibility and because they
                                naturally oppose any U.S. disposition to act unilaterally. Further,
                                our Allies will be unsettled until they can explore the changed
                                situation resulting from Cuba and can know through consultation our
                                reading of it.</p>
                            <p>On balance, it appears that while our scope for unilateral action may
                                be restricted, we have increased our capacity, with consultation, to
                                bring our Allies along with us.</p>

                            <p>A variety of Allied interpretations of the Cuban outcome is possible

                            <p>The basic source of instability is obviously the division of Germany.
                                Even if East Germany were prosperous, under a more liberal regime,
                                and without the problem of Berlin, it is doubtful that the
                                underlying sentiment for reunification would die out either in East
                                Germany or West Germany.</p>
                            <p>Other important sources of instability are the division of Berlin
                                symbolized by the Wall, the uncertain access to Berlin, the
                                unsettled boundaries, and the absence of a definitive German peace
                                treaty. The interaction of military threat and defense, viewed
                                differently from each side, adds to the seriousness of the other
                                instabilities.</p>
                            <p>Any long-term solution should cut as deeply as possible into these
                                instabilities. The Soviet Union has in the past had a clear and
                                unambiguous policy with respect to Berlin and Germany: a solution of
                                all the above instabilities, perhaps over an extended time frame, in
                                a manner acceptable to it. It has rejected all Western proposals not
                                consistent with eventual progress toward the Soviet objectives. The
                                Western powers, not having the means, diplomatic or otherwise, to
                                reverse this position, have attempted to stand firm against further
                                encroachments.</p>
                            <p>The question cannot now be answered whether Soviet policy on Berlin
                                will have hardened or relaxed as a result of Cuba. Undoubtedly,
                                however, it will be different. It is possible that they too will see
                                the danger of another Cuban crisis over Berlin. If so, it is
                                possible they will want a prompt solution of the important German
                                and Berlin instabilities in a manner mutually agreeable to them and
                                the U.S. Only on this hypothesis, which will be substantially
                                affected by the possibilities of U.S.-Soviet agreement on other
                                important areas of instability apart from Germany, can one see the
                                possibility of a long-run solution of the Berlin situation
                                satisfactory to the West.</p>

                            <p>Possible long-term approaches toward stability include All-German,

                            <p>Objectively, and certainly from the U.S. interest, the best end would
                                be an all-German solution in which, ultimately, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would in effect be absorbed by The
                                Federal Republic. It would remove all the instabilities listed in
                                III (above).</p>
                            <p>Such a solution, running directly counter to central Soviet
                                objectives, would probably be considered by <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> only in the context of
                                broad European security arrangements. To achieve it, we should be
                                prepared to make substantial concessions on our side, short of
                                removing Germany from the Atlantic and European political and
                                economic communities.</p>
                            <p>Some form of merger of the existing two states would seem called for
                                initially, and a wide variety of sequences and phasings of the
                                various steps toward eventual unification would be possible. The
                                nature of the arrangements, and the duration of the process would
                                have to be designed to reduce Soviet resistance. Among the steps
                                toward, or elements of, an all-German solution would be: <list>
                                    <item>—Increased economic intercourse between the two Germanies,
                                        with substantial economic aid from West to East designed to

                            <p>If the unity of Germany cannot be achieved, the other major sources
                                of instability could be removed or mitigated through an all-Berlin
                                solution. It would eliminate the wall dividing Berlin, though it
                                would probably require, from the Soviet viewpoint, maintenance of a
                                barrier surrounding all Berlin.</p>
                            <p>The instability of access could be greatly reduced by the cession, or
                                perhaps long-term lease, of an autobahn corridor to the city. Were
                                this not obtained, access instability would remain high. An access
                                authority with clear non-bloc control would mitigate but not
                                eliminate the instability.</p>
                            <p>Under an All-Berlin solution with a corridor, we might be able to
                                force through a definite peace treaty signed by both East and West
                                (or perhaps parallel treaties), a settlement of German boundaries,
                                and the recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. It

                                a serious effort to resolve the whole East-West tensions problem,
                                the USSR would prefer some such long-term solution to those

                                we have been seeking without success to establish such an agreed
                                modus vivendi, but it may be that the Cuban crisis will increase
                                elasticity to some degree on both sides. The Soviets have had an
                                example of U.S. firmness. They could now feel that rather than test
                                us again, closer to the jugular, it would be preferable either to
                                continue the debate, in the vicinity of the status quo, or to agree
                                on a workable modus vivendi. On the Western side, the Cuban success
                                has made less compelling the need to avoid any appearance of
                                elasticity in order to preserve Allied confidence in our

                            <p>On the other hand, if the Soviets feel their recent losses strongly,
                                they may find it even less possible to make concessions on
                                long-debated issues.</p>
                            <p>Components of a modus vivendi have been combed over many times,
                                especially in the last year. Aside from significantly reduced
                                tension in Berlin and prospects for reasonable stability there,
                                several other general criteria would have to be met. Allied vital
                                interests would have to be safeguarded; these appear to be unchanged
                                by the Cuban outcome, so that the presence and security of Allied

                                side, assured control over East Germany and some enhancement,
                                possibly nominal, of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> status
                                appear to be minima. Having these in hand, and depending on how one
                                assesses the likely tone of Soviet policies toward Berlin,

                            <p>A third broad line of approach is to refrain at this time from
                                further initiatives on Berlin, on the assumption that the Soviets
                                will also be willing to let the atmosphere cool before making new
                                moves in the hyper-sensitive Berlin area.</p>
                            <p>This approach aims at allowing both sides to reassess the situation
                                without altering the outstanding issues which underlie instability
                                in Berlin. It attempts to create a more favorable environment for a
                                Berlin solution by progress toward agreement and easing of tensions
                                elsewhere.</p>
                            <p>Since the status quo is the essence of the existing Western Berlin
                                position, this approach might seem to appeal more to us than to the
                                Soviets, but it leaves us still exposed to the basic dangers of the
                                situation.</p>
                            <p>Soviet receptivity to a hold-off approach on Berlin is uncertain. It
                                might appeal to them as a way to dissipate U.S. momentum from Cuba,
                                and to allow time for strengthening the Soviet posture against a
                                future confrontation. Apart from possible repercussions of the Cuban
                                crisis upon the Soviet attitude toward Berlin, a Soviet hold-off
                                position is supported by some evidence that <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                    >GDR</gloss> and Soviet propaganda is stressing that further
                                delay must be expected before the signing of a peace treaty. It
                                would also be consistent with the trend noted in current discussions
                                between West and East German representatives on the inter-zonal
                                trade.</p>

                            <p>The effects of the Cuban crisis cannot yet be accurately seen. In any
                                event, many elements of any solution are not under our control. In
                                this situation, we must clearly analyze and be prepared to work
                                toward a full spectrum of outcomes.</p>
                            <p>Insofar as we do control the movement of events, it would seem
                                desirable to aim at a long-range solution. Long-range solutions face
                                much the greatest obstacles; they may well, in the event, prove
                                impossible to achieve. Lesser measures, however, and in particular
                                the hold-off approach, leave us with the possibility of a Cuba-type
                                crisis over Berlin only postponed. Even if there is a Soviet
                                disposition to avoid Berlin initiatives for the time being, an
                                extended moratorium is unlikely, and we could be faced with a
                                challenge under no better conditions, perhaps with some of our
                                bargaining counters expended on peripheral issues. It would
                                therefore appear improvident to overlook any chance to get an
                                enduring solution.</p>
                            <p>(Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>, on the
                                other hand, holds in general that in the present tensions, and in
                                the face of the present obstacles, acceptable movement in the Berlin
                                problem is unlikely to be possible, and attempts in this line could
                                do damage by arousing Allies and USSR alike. He would therefore
                                support a hold-off approach, seeking to get useful agreements in
                                other areas, improving the climate generally, and approaching the
                                complex of Berlin issues later.)</p>

                        <p>While Soviets themselves first suggested a relationship between Berlin
                            and Cuba in September 11 <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> statement
                            Moscow has, since outbreak of Cuban crisis, carefully avoided any hint
                            of a direct link between events in Cuba and Berlin situation.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d150fn1">In an earlier telegram on November 7 the Department
                                of State had informed the Mission at Berlin that it had consistently
                                sought to discourage press speculation about links between Cuba and
                                Berlin. The telegram continued that the Department of State was
                                taking the line that it had no indication of Soviet intentions to
                                resume harassment of the Allied position in Berlin in the immediate
                                future. (Telegram 440 to Berlin; ibid., 862B.181/11–662)</note>
                            Various Soviet officials abroad evidently reflecting instructions have
                            also indicated that USSR would not move against Berlin should it
                            retaliate because of Cuban developments.</p>
                        <p>Moscow appears to be anxious that tension generated by Cuba not spill
                            over into Berlin; whether because of fear of possible US reactions or to
                            avoid prejudicing post-election negotiations (to which Moscow remains
                            committed) or a combination of both factors remains to be seen. In any
                            event Soviets continue reaffirm publicly their commitment to a “German
                            peace treaty and resolution of Berlin situation on that basis” (Brezhnev
                            October 30), and now avoid any public reference to a separate <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> treaty. Vigorous Polish support of
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> aims and interests up to and
                            including separate treaty is thus all more striking in view of recent
                            Soviet reticence.</p>
                        <p>We had previously thought Soviets were likely to set stage for coming
                            round of talks with some gesture directed toward improving atmosphere in
                            Berlin, most probably some minor alleviation of border traffic situation
                            within Berlin. Arrangements toward this end now appear to be well
                            underway. Desirability of a gesture of this nature would from Soviet
                            standpoint appear to be even greater now than it was previously if USSR
                            actually does desire to keep Berlin situation calm for time being.</p>
                        <p>And since Soviet moves to ease pressure on Berlin are usually accompanied
                            by overtures to West Germans, some relaxation of travel restrictions of
                            persons between East and West Germany similar to that in Berlin is also
                            conceivable under present circumstances if it can be engineered in
                            manner which does not endanger <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            security.</p>
                        <p>As a further element in Soviet calculations on Berlin, seeming Soviet
                            retreat in Cuba will almost inevitably have repercussions in East German
                            party organization and complicate its already almost insurmountable
                            tasks. And uncertainty already evident in functionary corps will in turn
                            feed and stimulate existing popular dissatisfaction with regime. If past
                            experience is any guide, <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> would
                            perforce be compelled <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0443"/>to
                            maintain a semblance of closed ranks to protect its position and
                            preserve <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> dominance.</p>
                        <p>Whether in long run position of <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> can
                            be maintained with such methods in view of changing political climate
                            and anti-Stalinist campaign in bloc is questionable however. It may be
                            that after initial shock of Cuban events has been overcome Soviets may
                            seriously consider liberalization of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>If this actually were Kremlin’s plan of action, radical change in
                            circumstances now underway will require revision of Soviet planning on
                            Berlin and probably cause at least considerable postponement of
                            scheduled denouement outlined above. At this point however indications
                            are that Soviets have been caught up short by US reaction in Cuba and
                            are as yet undecided on specific courses of action with respect to
                            Berlin other than avoiding tension in that area for time being.</p>
                        <p>Soviets have with foresight been careful to tie themselves to no
                            timetable on Berlin and thus are free to procrastinate by a variety of
                            means without serious loss of face.</p>
                        <p>In any event further US-Soviet exchanges on Berlin following US elections
                            still seem almost certain and there is still a possibility that this new
                            round will be initiated by a <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> visit to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                            (Current Soviet propaganda line attributing preservation of world peace
                            in Cuban context to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            personal statesmanship may well be intended in part as buildup for

                            Soviet and bloc commentaries does not however suggest USSR intends—in

                            before General Assembly. Emphasis appears instead to be tending toward

                                xml:id="d151fn1">The negotiating paper, entitled “Negotiations,”
                                November 9, is not attached to the source text, but is printed in

                                The paper described a series of topics (bilateral, arms control, and
                                Germany and Berlin), which had already been staffed and which were
                                generally familiar to the U.S. Allies, that might be the subject of
                                negotiations with the Soviet Union (Track A) and a more radical
                                series of proposals on Germany and Berlin (Track B) that might be
                                the subject of informal U.S.-Soviet discussions to see if progress
                                might be made leading to a summit. (Department of State, Central

                            read. (I attach a copy of our paper. You’ll be getting five copies

                        <p>The supplement is <persName>Tommy Thompson</persName>’s concept of a West
                            Berlin solution. It is virtually the same as our expanded Berlin/Germany
                            proposal in Track B, except that it does not provide for the 7–10 year
                            stretch-out of the Western Peace Plan.</p>
                        <p>In addition, we shall be giving some thought to the possibility of a
                            bolder diplomatic initiative which the U.S. might take beyond the quite
                            radical proposals in Track B. Their weakness, as pure initiatives, is
                            that (except for the radical disarmament proposal) they could not be
                            surfaced with our allies until there is clear evidence that Mr.

                            serious business indeed.</p>
                        <p>There is, within our group, a desire to explore whether there exists some
                            course of action or initiative we might take which would: <list>

                            <p>The following is a possible package deal on West Berlin, which
                                attempts to take account of Soviet and East German interests as well
                                as United States and West German interests. The general idea would
                                be to make a number of changes which would have the possibility of
                                removing the Berlin problem from the area of contention for a
                                considerable period of time. The general approach would be that of a
                                scale balance in which the weights on both sides could be changed
                                without upsetting the overall balance. The following are only
                                suggestive and in actual negotiation, if a concession on one side
                                proved impractical, the offsetting concession on the other side
                                would have to be dropped.</p>

                            <p>It will be noted that such a package would enable the Soviet Union to

                                the hook he is on, but it may well be that if agreement reached
                                along lines set forth above that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                    >Khrushchev</persName> may not attach so much importance to a

                            <p>For the West, the chief advantage would be acquiring secure access

                        <p>At his request Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName>
                            called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName> to
                            deliver a book which Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SVS1"
                                >Semenov</persName> had said he would send to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName> during a conversation at
                            the Secretary of State’s dinner for Foreign Minister <persName

                            out to be “West Berlin—The Facts”, issued in English by the Foreign
                            Language Publishing House in Moscow in 1962. It apparently has been
                            distributed fairly widely in New York in connection with the General
                            Assembly Session.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName> observed that it now
                            seemed appropriate that the dialogue on Berlin should be resumed between
                            the Soviet Union and the United States. It appeared to him that each
                            side was waiting for the other to take the initiative to resume contacts
                            on this subject. Speaking personally, he did not believe that Chairman
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would be coming to
                            the General Assembly Session. Purely from a timing point of view, this
                            would be very difficult. The Central Committee would be meeting in
                            Moscow for a week or so starting on the 19th of November and the <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> Session was supposed to end around
                            December 10.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName> commented that we
                            seemed to be at a somewhat interdeterminate stage as far as Berlin
                            discussions were concerned. It was not clear precisely how these should
                            or would be resumed. After all, the leaders of both countries had been
                            concentrating on other problems during the past month, and as he was
                            aware, the Cuban question had to date not been satisfactorily
                            settled.</p>
                        <p>As to summitry, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName> said
                            that the positions of the United States and the Soviet Union now
                            appeared to be the same in considering <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426"
                                facs="0448"/>that a summit meeting might be useful under two sets of
                            circumstances: during a crisis in order to avert conflict, and after
                            substantial agreement had been reached at a lower level in order to
                            confirm this agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1"
                                >Hillenbrand</persName> observed that, in the past, we had sometimes
                            had the impression that summit meetings were thought of in terms of
                            their propaganda effect or as useful in creating a mood which was not
                            necessarily in harmony with the nature of the issues under dispute.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName> referred to press
                            reports this morning of Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName>’s views, and noted that he was quoted as being
                            opposed to any negotiations on Berlin and Germany at this time. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName> said we would,
                            of course, be hearing directly with the Chancellor on these matters.
                            This would be a more authoritative version of his views than those in
                            press reports as to the accuracy of which we had no guarantee.</p>
                        <p>Referring to a recent Flora Lewis article in the <hi rend="italic"

                                corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName> noted that, apart from the
                            Chancellor’s opposition to discussions now, he appeared to have accepted
                            the four points mentioned by Miss Lewis. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName> observed that the points
                            mentioned in the article had been contained in one form or another in
                            the informal working paper which the Secretary had handed Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at Geneva last
                            March on a personal basis. <persName corresp="#p_KGM1"
                                >Kornienko</persName> said this was true, but these matters had not
                            really been discussed in subsequent meetings between the Secretary and
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName> commented that this was
                            true, but as the Soviets were aware, the issue of Western troop presence
                            in Berlin had been singled out by mutual agreement as the crucial
                            one.</p>
                        <p>After a further exchange as to why the previous discussions on Berlin had
                            not seemed to make any headway, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KGM1"
                                >Kornienko</persName> noted that a few points seemed to have emerged
                            which might provide a basis for further discussion. Apart from the idea
                            of an Arbitration Commission, to which Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had called attention, the
                            President had made a remark during his October 18 conversation with
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName><note n="3"

                            about the possibility of discussing the status of the Western troops in
                            Berlin which had been noted with interest.</p>
                        <p>The conversation concluded with <persName corresp="#p_KGM1"
                                >Kornienko</persName>’s remark that it now remained to be seen how
                            the discussion between the Soviet Union and the United States on Berlin
                            would be resumed.</p>

                                (Ibid.) On October 25 the Chancellor thanked the President for the

                        <p>The private talks were held at the request of Chancellor <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> while he was walking with the
                            President to his office.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> congratulated the
                            President on the success achieved in the Cuban situation and indicated
                            that this was the beginning of a new epoch for the West. He also stated
                            that the President could rest assured that he would always find Germany
                            firmly on his side in situations like this.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that he was very appreciative of this stand
                            expressed by the Chancellor. He also appreciated the Chancellor’s
                            remarks to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName>
                            when the Cuban affair first got started. It was obvious, of course, that
                            the Cuban situation could have resulted in serious repercussions on
                            Berlin, and everyone was aware of that at the time.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor replied that he is well familiar with the world situation
                            and realizes that the President had to make his decision on Cuba not
                            with reference to any one single problem but in the light of the overall
                            world situation. Thus, he could not be concerned only with the German
                            question at the time. The latter is just one of the big problems which
                            Providence has placed on the shoulders of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>. With reference to today’s
                            reception, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> recalled
                            his visit to Paris a few <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0450"/>months
                            ago and a parade held in his honor on that occasion, showing French
                            tanks and other military equipment. Chancellor <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> had stood side by side with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, and he
                            termed the occasion an historical event. Today’s ceremony at the White
                            House, too, he did not consider just a colorful show, but a truly
                            historical event.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed his appreciation for this sentiment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> then made the request
                            that he be given the opportunity to discuss his ideas on Berlin in only
                            the smallest of circles.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> indicated that
                            he would honor this request. He stated that he wished to get the
                            Chancellor’s ideas on what Western procedures should be from this point
                            on with regard to Berlin. He asked for the Chancellor’s comments and
                            what he considered the best timing with regard to arrangements which
                            might give us hope to achieve some kind of a permanent settlement of
                            that problem.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor replied that he would like to express himself very
                            cautiously on this point. He himself had no knowledge to what extent the
                            Cuban situation could actually be considered solved. For that reason the
                            decision as to what to do vis-a-vis the Russians, even on possible
                            German initiatives, was up to the President. If the President were of
                            the opinion that all his demands with regard to Cuba had been fulfilled
                            by the Soviets, then he might try to proceed on the question of Berlin.
                            If, however, he did not feel that his demands there had been fully met
                            by the Soviets, then Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>
                            felt it was better to wait.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that he had been interested in a statement made
                            to the press by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> not
                            long ago in which he expressed the opinion that not all missiles had
                            been removed from Cuba. The President stated that no one knew of course
                            with complete certainty whether all missiles had been removed. For all
                            we knew some might have been hidden in caves or other spots on the
                            island. It was our judgment, however, that the missiles had, for the
                            most part, been removed. We had counted thirty-three of them from the
                            air and supporting equipment for forty-eight, in other words two
                            regiments. We had now counted forty-two missiles being taken out. The
                            President did not believe that there was much advantage to the Soviet
                            Union in keeping a few missiles in Cuba. If another missile attempt were
                            to be made in Cuba at a later time, it would be better to take
                            everything out now and start anew some other time. He was pretty sure,
                            however, that the Cuban missile episode was ended. The Soviets knew now
                            that the next time they started something of this sort we would invade
                            Cuba. While we were pretty sure that the missiles had been removed, we
                            had not achieved any agreement as yet on the bombers, which we
                            definitely wanted removed. We were also insisting on inspection. At the
                            same time we felt that our own system of air inspection is much better
                            and surer than having <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers on the
                            spot for inspection purposes. We <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0451"
                            />felt that we could rely better on our own cameras. The second problem,
                            however, at present really the chief one, was that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had grossly lied on the
                            Cuban situation and the President therefore had no confidence in
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> at all. For this
                            reason also he was not interested in the West taking the initiative
                            vis-a-vis the Russians in the Berlin question, but rather favored
                            waiting for their moves.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor fully agreed with this opinion. He felt that it was not
                            very important whether any remnants of equipment had been left in Cuba
                            to salve Castro’s feelings. He also considered that the chief thing was
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had lied dismally
                            to the President. He had tried to launch as criminal and as dangerous an
                            attack on the United States as anyone had ever undertaken, and the
                            President had been successful in warding it off. If the President were
                            to resume talks with the Soviets at once after all these happenings,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would think that
                            the President was willing to let bygones be bygones. He would therefore
                            be encouraged to start trouble somewhere else. In this connection the
                            Chancellor pointed out something he had learned from Nazi times. A
                            dictatorship completely changes the moral fiber and manner of thinking
                            of the person involved, for example <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>, completely warping the personality so that
                            his way of thinking will be entirely different from that of the
                            President or Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> for
                            instance.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that there is ample evidence that the aim of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> is the same as the
                            aim of the Chinese Communists, only his methods are somewhat different.
                            His long range ambitions remain the same but his tactics have been
                            somewhat complicated by the setback he has suffered in Cuba. Three
                            factors in the world situation are different from what they were about
                            two months ago: One was the failure of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s designs in Cuba; the second was his
                            difficulties with the Communist Chinese; and the third was the
                            complications arising out of the Chinese-Indian conflict. The importance
                            of these was how they would affect <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s further actions. One thing was clear, of
                            course, he wants to get both the United States and Germany.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor concurred and went on to say that a slow revolution was
                            taking place in Russia. No one knew how far this revolution had
                            progressed. Of one thing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> felt sure, however, namely that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would not risk all his
                            achievements by starting a war. He will try to achieve further successes
                            by intrigue and through cold war. This needs to be watched very
                            carefully. He, too, was of the opinion that we should take our time and
                            carefully observe developments but not act as though nothing had
                            happened. As an outsider, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> wished to say that the United States had been
                            in very grave danger indeed and the President had averted this danger.
                            This constituted a tremendous victory for the President himself and for
                            the American people. On the other side, however, there was a real
                            criminal, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, who needed
                                <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0452"/>careful watching.
                            Therefore, the Chancellor advised observing developments carefully
                            before having any further dealings with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>. The Chancellor was speaking as a German, of
                            course. His opinion, however, differed from that of his own Foreign
                            Minister, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>, who would
                            act differently in this matter. The latter might be inclined to draw up
                            a new memorandum on German-Soviet relations. Germany had done this in
                            1958 and still had had no reply from Moscow. Now, however, the
                            Chancellor felt that the decision on whether to proceed with regard to
                            the Soviets was up to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName>. At the same time the Chancellor felt that Cuba
                            from <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s standpoint
                            should be chalked up as a failure. Likewise, the Chinese situation
                            presented grave difficulties to him as did the Chinese-Indian conflict.
                            Perhaps it would be well for us to sit back and wait and let <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> think matters over a bit and
                            see what happens.</p>
                        <p>The President then stated that no one seems to be able really to read the
                            Soviets; certainly no one in the United States. None of the Soviet
                            experts in the United States would ever have imagined that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would undertake to station
                            missiles in Cuba. On the other hand the Soviets would never have thought
                            that we would react the way we did or else they would not have placed
                            the missiles in Cuba. Thus, neither side appears very adept at
                            interpreting the other, and both sides are to some extent blind.
                            Nevertheless, within the limitations of our judgment, we must try to
                            evaluate what effect the previously mentioned factors will have on
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s reactions, and
                            then decide on the basis thereof whether it might be advantageous to
                            talk with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> on the
                            Berlin question now, or whether it might be better to wait say six
                            months or even longer. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> doubted that we would be able to tell anything
                            certain until the bomber question had been settled. The Chancellor
                            replied that most people do not judge <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> correctly, since they generally talk in terms
                            of what he has not achieved or wants to achieve and rarely speak in
                            terms of what he has achieved. The Chancellor believes that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> has achieved a great deal
                            during the past ten years for instance. In 1953 Russia had no atom
                            weapons, but in 1962 she was sending nuclear missiles to Cuba. The
                            Chancellor is convinced that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> values very highly what he has achieved so
                            far. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> recalled that he
                            had previously told the President about his meetings with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> in 1955, when for a period
                            of six days he met with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> as many as three times a day, experiencing
                            all of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s moods.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> is smart,
                            completely ruthless and has no conscience whatsoever, but he is a Soviet
                            patriot at heart and he will not risk his achievements in a war. Only
                            now he has understood the determination of the United States and US
                            strength and he will have to digest this for awhile before he can adapt
                            his actions to this in the future. The Chancellor considers it
                            definitely a mistake to resume dealings <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431"
                                facs="0453"/>with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            at once because, he repeated, then <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> would feel that everyone is willing to forget
                            what happened and he will act accordingly. The Chancellor agreed that
                            perhaps his reactions with reference to the bomber removal might
                            indicate what conclusions <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> is drawing. Also the Chinese situation should
                            make him think. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>
                            recalled that in 1955 <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            had actually asked Germany to help him against Red China and <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> was convinced that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> lives in real fear of China.
                            Therefore, the Chancellor advises dragging our feet vis-a-vis the
                            Soviets. If <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> swallows
                            all of Cuba including the bomber question then the President will have
                            time to think matters over. If then he decides the time is ripe to take
                            further steps, he may count on Germany to live up to its obligations.
                            But the time is not ripe now.</p>
                        <p>The President reiterated that he felt it was important to decide whether
                            the happenings of the last two months might have made <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> more vulnerable to pressure
                            and therefore more ready to enter into an agreement on Berlin than he
                            might be six months hence or in a year. The President realized that we
                            could never be really sure that the right moment was at hand, but he was
                            certain that he would not be able to tell anything for at least three
                            more weeks.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor thought the idea was very simple. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had disgraced himself before
                            the world and his people. If there were to be any talks with him at the
                            present time, he would try to do everything in his power to prove that
                            he was not getting soft or too old in order to wipe out his disgrace.
                            Therefore, we could expect that in any talks now on any but the Cuban
                            question Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would
                            take a very unyielding stand.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed that this might be the case. On the other hand, he
                            felt that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had talked
                            about Berlin for so long that he might be willing to accept some kind of
                            a settlement precisely in view of the difficulties he had had in Cuba,
                            with the Chinese, etc. Perhaps, he would value getting some kind of an
                            agreement on paper which might strengthen him domestically and which he
                            needed vis-a-vis China. Thus, perhaps, he might be willing to accept
                            something now that he would not be willing to accept later. Therefore
                            the President felt that we should watch Cuban developments carefully and
                            be ready for any indication from Moscow that might give us a clue
                            whether it would be better to act now or later. Not that the President
                            felt we should start; we should wait to see what they might be intending
                            to do.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor agreed that if <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> felt the need for domestic reasons to achieve
                            a settlement of some question he would come and seek the agreement on
                            his own. If, however, the United States and Germany would approach him
                            as partners, as it were, then <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> would become very hard and unyielding.
                            Therefore the Chancellor <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0454"/>fully
                            agreed that it was necessary to wait and to watch for <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s reactions.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor then indicated that there was another matter that he
                            wished to raise privately. He said that Germany, historically, has good
                            relations with some of the Latin American countries. These are based on
                            human rather than political considerations. Thus a Minister from Brazil,
                            whose name the Chancellor could not at the moment recall, visited the
                            Chancellor recently. This Minister had started a Christian Democratic
                            Union in Brazil and was getting the German party’s publications in that
                            connection. In his talk with the Chancellor he discussed some of the
                            Latin American attitudes toward the United States, and the Chancellor
                            wished to propose an idea for the President to examine. It was not
                            necessarily his own idea. His proposal envisaged establishing vis-a-vis
                            the South American countries, started by the United States and Europe, a
                            kind of <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that he was convinced that Europe should play a
                            much more important role in South America. That hemisphere represented a
                            real danger spot, especially Brazil. At the same time there were many
                            common factors between Europe and Latin America such as language,
                            religion and culture. Moreover, the historically conditioned hostility
                            vis-a-vis the United States does not exist with reference to Europe. He
                            then asked the Chancellor to indicate the areas of disagreement or
                            attitudes which the man from Brazil had mentioned.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor stated that the Brazilian had complained about the
                            patronizing attitude displayed by the United States vis-a-vis Latin
                            America. The Latin Americans considered themselves on a par with the
                            Europeans and resented such attitudes. At the same time the Brazilian
                            had indicated that he had been in Washington and complained of the
                            treatment received, either at the White House or the State Department,
                            the Chancellor could not remember which. The Brazilian was therefore
                            complaining out of hurt pride. The Chancellor then pointed out that the
                            Brazilian in question is now in Washington and if the President permits
                            he will pass the man’s name to the Secretary of State who could then
                            perhaps ask the Brazilian to come and see him.</p>
                        <p>The President thought that this might be a good idea. Then, he stated
                            that as regards Berlin, he felt there was agreement that we should wait
                            until the complete solution of the present Cuban problem. We should not
                            make any approach to the Russians on Berlin but stand ready to listen to
                            their proposals and consider what our position should be in case they
                            came up with proposals that were different from those made by them in
                            the past. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had visited the
                            President in October and had voiced proposals which were completely
                            unreasonable and downright insulting. There was no point discussing
                            proposals of that kind. If, however, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> came up with different proposals we should be
                                <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0455"/>prepared to exploit them.
                            Until then we would have to wait. Also since no one appeared to be very
                            good at reading the Communist world we should be prepared to deal with
                            the possibility of one or more different reactions. Thus we should be
                            ready to deal with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> if
                            he turned out to have become more unreasonable on the basis of his
                            pres-ent difficulties, but we should also not discount the possibility
                            that he might be prompted to want to seek some kind of a settlement. We
                            should be ready in either case.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor then indicated that the Soviets were definitely having
                            economic difficulties. He made reference to the West German trade
                            agreement with the Soviet Zone. He stated that some time ago the Soviet
                            Zone representative approached West Germany expressly with the consent
                            and knowledge of the Soviet authorities, stating that if West Germany
                            were to give the Soviet Zone several hundred million <gloss
                                target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss>’s they would be ready to enter into an
                            agreement giving permission to the West Berliners to come and go in the
                            Zone undisturbed, but not the other way around. The Chancellor had
                            expected that this matter might have been settled by the time of his
                            trip to the United States, but this was not the case. He therefore
                            proposed to keep the President informed of developments. He felt however
                            that the fact that these questions were raised at the Zone’s initiative
                            with Russian approval was an encouraging sign.</p>
                        <p>Before joining the larger group in the Cabinet Room the President
                            indicated that he and the Chancellor would have further private
                                talks.<note n="1" xml:id="d153fn1">In the meeting with the larger

                        <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> indicated that
                            he had had a chance to discuss the question raised during the morning
                                meeting<note n="1" xml:id="d154fn1">See <ref target="#d153fn1"
                                    >footnote 1, Document 153</ref>.</note> with General
                                <persName>Heusinger</persName> and had found that views concerning
                            this matter had been clarified considerably since the Cuban crisis.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that he had had the opportunity to discuss the same
                            question with General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> and
                            wished to inform the Chancellor of the following: (1) Our troops are
                            equipped with some Davy Crocketts but it is our opinion that the Soviets
                            do not have much similar equipment; (2) If our troops were to use some
                            of this nuclear equipment in the case of an emergency, the same type of
                            equipment would immediately be released on the same basis to the other
                            forces fighting together with us so that there would be no difference in
                            their equipment.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor expressed his satisfaction at this news.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that he had asked General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> to come and discuss this matter
                            with the Chancellor. He wondered, however, whether the Chancellor might
                            prefer to have General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            speak with General <persName>Heusinger</persName> and then have
                            Heusinger inform the Chancellor about the discussion.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor answered that he would prefer the latter since he himself
                            is no expert in these matters.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he understood Defense Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would be the Chancellor’s
                            dinner companion this evening and they would therefore have a chance to
                            discuss this matter too.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> then stated that he
                            briefly wished to explain a few things about <persName corresp="#p_DGC1"
                                >De Gaulle</persName> in this small group in order to contribute to
                            a better understanding of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>’s position. <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> had chided <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> in 1959 for committing so few troops to <gloss

                                Gaulle</persName> had answered: I do not know your opinion of
                            generals but if you commit them to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>, you lose control over them completely. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> stated that he had not really
                            understood the meaning of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>’s words until the troubles later with the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he did not really see the connection because
                            having the generals in Algeria was quite a different matter, since that
                            problem was one in which much emotion was involved. Committing troops in
                            Western Europe is an entirely different problem since there <pb n="435"
                                xml:id="pg_435" facs="0457"/>they are used in our attempts to tackle
                            our major problem, namely the Soviets. The President conceded that the
                            uncertain disposition of these troops might possibly have some political
                            implications, but the danger of not having sufficient troops available
                            to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in our dealings with the
                            Soviets was far more dangerous.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor then stated he felt that the President did not quite
                            appreciate the French situation. If it were left to the National
                            Assembly, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would be
                            overthrown at once. The parties represented in the Assembly are rooted
                            back home, and the officers come from those same areas. This is where
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>’s concern came
                            from. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> indicated that the
                            political situation in France is extremely weak. We should not forget
                            that the Communist Party in France is the second largest party and that
                            they are the kind of Communists who are willing to fight on the
                            barricades. It is a little known fact that three military depots were
                            plundered by <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> revolutionary forces
                            only a short time ago without meeting any resistance. One of them was in
                            Versailles. This was done obviously to get arms for the revolutionary
                                <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>. The Chancellor was convinced
                            that if <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> were overthrown
                            the result would be a catastrophe for France. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is really trying to give
                            France some inner strength. He told the Chancellor that this is at the
                            bottom of his disagreement with the Parliament. If France had even one
                            party ready to assume sole responsibility then the situation would be in
                            good hands. There was no such party, however, and the six or seven
                            parties in existence were all alike. Each knew that when one government
                            fell the other one would come in and each in turn would have a chance to
                            furnish the Prime Minister. Therefore things kept going around like a
                            merry-go-round. The situation in France had really been desperate until
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> took over and if he
                            had not come in when he did, there was real danger of a true civil
                            war.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that this problem was related to another one which
                            he wished to discuss with the Chancellor. This was the matter of our
                            dollar balance, which of course always affects the burdens we are
                            carrying overseas. Under no circumstances did we want to retrench in our
                            overseas defense efforts, which were costing us about $3 billion
                            annually. (The Chancellor expressed surprise that it was so little. He
                            had thought it would be considerably more.) For this reason the United
                            States greatly appreciated the <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1"
                                >Strauss</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>
                            arrangement whereby German orders would be placed in the United States
                            in the amount of $250 million per year. Since our difficulties in
                            October we had had to draw on our dollar resources even more and had
                            since then heard the disquieting rumor that for budgetary reasons the
                            Federal Republic was expecting not to fulfill this agreement this year.
                            This would mean that our deficit would be that much higher this year and
                            this would have a <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0458"/>very bad
                            psychological effect. The President hoped that Germany could see its way
                            to making the purchases as anticipated. The Chancellor indicated that he
                            was not informed in this matter and that he would look into it on his
                            return. He would do everything in his power to see that Germany’s
                            promise was kept.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that we were appreciative of the aid extended so far
                            in this respect by the Federal Republic, for instance their percentage
                            of dollar holdings. It was important that our deficit did not go up over
                            last year. If it remained the same, it was tolerable, but if it
                            increased it constituted a worsening of the situation. He had heard that
                            Germany expected to make up next year what they would not be buying this
                            year but it would be better if it were done this year. The President
                            then stated that he would like to give the Chancellor a one-page
                            memorandum on this matter to take home with him.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the Cuban situation, the President indicated that it was
                            still very much unsettled. The possibility existed that we might have to
                            resort to more drastic steps, if the bomber situation was not solved
                            satisfactorily. The future was therefore still uncertain. The President
                            then reiterated the consensus reached at the morning meeting concerning
                            Berlin, namely that both he and the Chancellor thought that it was
                            inappropriate for the West to undertake any initiative vis-a-vis the
                            Soviets until a final solution had been achieved in Cuba, and future
                            Soviet intentions became more clear. After successful completion of the
                            Cuban affair we should be prepared with our position in case the Soviets
                            came up with proposals that were better than what they had come up with
                            in October. Perhaps the right moment for this might come in two or three
                            months. No one could know the exact time. Perhaps it might be less.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor then said that he thought the President might be
                            interested in hearing the German ideas about a possible cooling off
                            period of ten years and asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Carstens</persName> to present this problem in English.<note n="2"

                                here, together with a paper discussing it, drafted by <persName

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> stated that this
                            matter was being treated as highly confidential in Germany and that the
                            United States was the first one to be told about it. It had not been
                            discussed with either the British or the French and even in Germany was
                            confined to a very small circle. Germany felt, however, that if the US
                            approved, this plan might perhaps be submitted to the Soviets but it had
                            probably best come from the United States. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> then briefly enumerated the
                            eight points of the proposal: <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0459"
                            />(1) A ten-year standstill period on Berlin and the German question in
                            general, i.e., no peace treaty, etc.</p>
                        <p>(2) This point is one well known to all parties concerned. It deals with
                            an international access authority with administration and control over
                            certain traffic routes. (In reply to the President’s question whether
                            they had thought about who the members of the authority would be, Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> replied that they had
                            avoided this, since the plan was meant to be a very general one in order
                            not to get bogged down in all the difficulties which would be created by
                            too much detail.)</p>
                        <p>(3) Establishment of two mixed German commissions with representatives
                            from both West and East Germany. These commissions were to handle two
                            problems: (a) Increase economic exchange between the two parts of
                            Germany; (b) Establish a free movement of persons between the two areas;
                            talks on the latter subject have been going on between the two parts of
                            Germany for some time.</p>
                        <p>This third point would actually meet the Soviet demand that East and West
                            Germany get together to work out some of their problems themselves, and
                            so far the Federal Republic had always refused. If these two commissions
                            proved successful, this plan envisaged setting up additional mixed
                            commissions to handle additional problems of a limited nature.</p>
                        <p>(4) A non-aggression declaration by the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw Pact powers together with a statement
                            renouncing the use of force to solve international questions, especially
                            frontier readjustments.</p>
                        <p>(5) After the ten-year cool-off this plan envisaged a plebiscite under
                            international control on the question of German reunification.</p>
                        <p>(6) and (7) These two points dealt with the two possible results of the
                            plebiscite. In case the majority of both areas voted for reunification,
                            then free elections were to be held to elect a German government which
                            would then send representatives to a German peace conference. At the
                            same time certain arrangements would be made to ensure that the
                            resulting military strength of Germany could not be shifted in such a
                            way as to create any more favorable or unfavorable situation for the
                            military alliances to which either East or West Germany belong at the
                            present time. Later, this unified Germany would then become a member of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The second possible result being provided for under these two points was
                            in case the majority of the Eastern Zone would vote against
                            reunification. In that case, the Western powers agreed to recognize the
                            existence of two separate Germanies, which, after the necessary
                            intermediate steps, would both become members of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and a peace conference would be held with
                            representatives of both Germanies present. <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438"
                                facs="0460"/>The problem of Berlin would still remain in this latter
                            case, and a plebiscite would probably be suggested to determine the
                            city’s status.</p>
                        <p>(8) During the ten-year cooling-off period there would be in operation a
                            four-power committee composed of Deputy Foreign Ministers which would be
                            dealing with the problems arising during that time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> stated that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> was the only person
                            with whom he had had occasion to discuss this German proposal very
                            briefly since his arrival in Washington.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he had not heard of this as yet. On the surface
                            it appeared to him that this 8-point proposal would give us all we want
                            without giving the Soviets much of anything. The Soviets would not buy
                            the idea, he thought, of a stand-still because that would mean the
                            continued presence of Western troops in Berlin, and the Soviets wanted
                            these definitely out. Moreover, we had renounced the use of force
                            before. All the Soviet Union would appear to be getting out of this plan
                            would be the somewhat uncertain Eastern German status under an access
                            authority. The President thought that we could live with this 8-point
                            agreement. As an argument vis-a-vis the Soviets we could state that we
                            are giving up our claim to immediate reunification, but the Soviets
                            might not be impressed by that. Moreover, if the Soviets hold to their
                            October demands that Western troops be withdrawn, we will not get
                            anywhere. If they change their attitude on troops they might be willing
                            to sign an agreement of this sort. The acceptability thereof would
                            probably depend on the status of West Berlin and what that is called and
                            the status of the Western forces in Berlin. In this connection, he
                            indicated, the suggestion relayed by Sir <persName corresp="#p_RSF1"

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> inquired about East
                            German views on the political implications of the access
                            arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>
                            indicated that what had been envisaged so far in this matter was very
                            limited in scope. The primary aim was for family reunions, and nothing
                            pertaining to general access had been touched upon.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor then suggested that the United States might perhaps
                            examine the access implications of the US having turned over to the
                            Soviets such territories as Pomerania and Thuringia. While the US had
                            held these areas, free access to Berlin should have been assured. West
                            German law experts had looked into this matter without coming up with
                            anything useful. Perhaps American experts of international law were more
                            clever.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that the presence of Western forces in Berlin had
                            been the key question in that situation for the past year. It was the
                            primary concern of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            proposal in October, and the President was not quite sure what Sir
                                <persName corresp="#p_RSF1">Frank Roberts</persName> had meant.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister indicated that there were two reports on this
                            matter: one, the report given out by Sir <persName corresp="#p_RSF1"
                                >Frank Roberts</persName> to his fellow ambassadors in Moscow;<note

                            had used the word “temporarily,” and apparently had spoken only of
                            exchanging the flag of the Western powers for the United Nations flag.
                            It was not clear whether this was meant to be a face-saving device or
                            not. However, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> was
                            fearful that once the change in flag had been made, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> might feel encouraged to
                            raise new problems every day, using the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> as an additional lever. This possibility could be
                            excluded only if the changeover were accompanied by an explicit
                            statement that all other bases remained unchanged. He feared, however,
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would not go
                            along with the latter. The President expressed agreement with this point
                            of view. It was his understanding, too, that <persName corresp="#p_RSF1"
                                >Roberts</persName> had said the word “temporarily” was used only
                            once. He felt the proposal was worth considering provided we ensured
                            that West Berlin remain free and that the commitments of the US, France
                            and the UK remained clear without the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            being able to take them over. Under those circumstances it might be
                            useful to make the change for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            flag. But the three powers would have to be carefully watching any
                            infringement of their rights and if the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> should act counter to these rights, the former status
                            would be reverted to at once. Perhaps we should listen somewhat more to
                            find out whether the Russians are interested merely in a face-saving
                            device, and if it were possible <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0462"
                            />to omit the word “temporarily,” some progress could perhaps be
                            achieved.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>
                            explained that he thought perhaps a sort of combination of the eight
                            points in the German proposal and <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s suggestion to Sir <persName
                                corresp="#p_RSF1">Frank Roberts</persName> might prove useful. If
                            there were agreement on that, the tactical question to be decided upon
                            would be the timing of the Western proposal to this effect. He hastened
                            to say that everything would, of course, have to wait until a settlement
                            in the Cuban affair.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that there was no indication how soon the Cuban
                            problem could be considered settled. Serious consequences might result
                            if the Soviets refused to take out the bombers. If this were the case,
                            the US was faced with several alternatives. They could reimpose the
                            quarantine at full force, which was not good psychologically because
                            world opinion might state that the missiles had been taken out and that
                            Russia should not be expected to back down twice, as it were. Thus it
                            might be difficult for us to keep the backing of other countries. On the
                            other hand, we might eliminate the quarantine which was not really in
                            operation at the present time, and, without invading Cuba, maintain our
                            overflights to keep the situation in check. The decision may be forced
                            upon us within the next ten days to two weeks. If the Soviets agree to
                            take the bombers out of Cuba, then we can consider that particular
                            chapter closed. Thus the President was of the opinion that the Cuban
                            situation should be resolved one way or another first. If <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> refuses to meet our
                            requirements there, then there is no point to try to discuss anything
                            with him. If, however, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            agrees to our requirements in Cuba, then we might inquire as to Soviet
                            proposals without, however, making any of our own for the time being. If
                            the Soviets put forth proposals on Berlin, then we should try to clarify
                            the status of Western troops in West Berlin. The answer to that will be
                            the decisive one.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor wondered what the possible implications might be of Soviet
                            fears of Red Chinese progress in Asia.</p>
                        <p>The President was of the opinion that it was very difficult for us to
                            determine this. Perhaps his fears in Asia might force <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> to be more reasonable at
                            this moment, and if this were the case we should certainly seize the
                            moment. In summary, the President reiterated that we should continue in
                            the Cuban matter to see what Soviet reaction will be there. If we fail
                            there, all further dealings with the Soviets will by necessity need to
                            be delayed. If we achieve a reasonable solution in Cuba, let us await
                            Soviet initiative on Berlin, see their attitude concerning Western
                            troops in Berlin, and then, if the time appears right, come back at them
                            with something like the 8-point proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor indicated that this appeared the correct approach. The
                            President was of the opinion that conversations concerning the
                            suggestion <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0463"/>reported by Sir
                                <persName corresp="#p_RSF1">Frank Roberts</persName> should be
                            expanded to see whether there might be some acceptable formula behind
                            it, and if there was, consideration should be given to the way in which
                            the Western Powers could give way to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> flag under full assurance, however, of the three-power
                            status. In any event, however, he felt that any progress in this respect
                            was possible only if <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            actually was inclined to relax the Berlin situation.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor pointed out that patience and more patience was
                            indicated.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed, provided it was coupled with a willingness to take
                            the necessary chance if and when it came.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State felt that it might be useful to discuss the
                            8-point proposal in the quadripartite Ambassadorial Group. The 10-year
                            cooling-off period actually was not such a revolutionary idea from the
                            Soviet standpoint. Actually they had been talking about a four to five
                            years delay, and it was therefore not unthinkable that they might agree
                            to extending this period to ten years. Moreover, consideration of this
                            plan might lead at an early date to a meeting of the Deputy Foreign
                            Ministers over an extended period, as in the case of Austria.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that it would be very important to keep this
                            entire matter out of the press, or it might create grave problems.
                            Therefore, he felt that only after preliminary discussion and
                            deliberation should this plan or idea be put into the machinery, as it
                            were, but not before.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> pointed out that it
                            would be difficult to keep these plans from our Allies for any length of
                            time.</p>
                        <p>The President repeated that he felt it was important to keep this out of
                            the press. He stated that it happened frequently that the Quadripartite
                            Group would get into an argument over a given idea and this would leak
                            to the press, only to have the Soviets come out with a statement that
                            they are not interested in this proposal at all.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor stated that the proposals in question are sort of day
                            dreams which it is better not to talk about.</p>
                        <p>The President again reiterated that it might be best perhaps for US and
                            German representatives to go further into the possible implementation of
                            the 8-point proposal, but to bring in the Allies only when it was time
                            to work out the details.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State stated that it was important to avoid the
                            impression that the plan that will be proposed is something new and
                            tremendous. He felt it was better to launch this thing quietly and
                            without fanfare and not as a new plan.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that he would be agreeable to whatever procedures
                            appeared best, but he felt that it was important that controversy <pb
                                n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0464"/>on the plan among the
                            Quadripartite Group should be kept to a minimum.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State suggested that the Quadripartite Group, when the
                            time came, should not be confronted with this plan as a systematic
                            8-point program, but rather only the ideas contained therein should be
                            communicated as such.</p>
                        <p>Again the President reiterated that it was important not to make anything
                            spectactular out of this new project because then the Soviets would get
                            wind of it and would be certain to say that they are not interested. In
                            any event we should put forth any kind of project only after the Soviets
                            had put forth proposals different from their October proposals, because
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s demands in October
                            had been something fearful.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor repeated that we should wait for <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s reaction and appear ready
                            to talk further only if the situation appeared favorable.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> then stated that
                            French Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> had
                            asked to see him the next day. What should or could <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> tell him in view of the present
                            discussion? The Chancellor stated that he felt it was easy. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> should tell <persName
                                corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> that until the Cuban situation
                            was solved it was wrong to begin discussions on anything else and
                            therefore it was decided to let matters rest until a solution of the
                            Cuban situation had been achieved.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> added “and until the
                            presence of Western troops in West Berlin had been clarified.”</p>
                        <p>The President agreed. He added that it was clear that we would have to
                            consult the French and the UK before we did any talking with the
                            Soviets. In the meantime, the whole matter had to be kept out of the
                            press because otherwise it would be made to appear as a new Western
                            initiative, and then <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            would come out, to begin with, with the statement that this was wrong.
                            And then we would be in another deadlock.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor indicated that under the circumstances it might be well to
                            break up the meeting since, the longer it lasted, the more suspicious
                            the press would become of what was going on inside.</p>
                        <p>The President then summed up that it was the consensus of the meeting
                            that it should not be made to appear as though the Chancellor’s visit
                            had resulted in a decision to take the initiative anew with regard to
                            Berlin. We might state that we exchanged views on the Berlin situation
                            and that the exchange was satisfactory. He then outlined once more the
                            steps to be taken, depending on the Cuban outcome, to await a Soviet
                            proposal, etc.</p>
                        <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0465"/>
                        <p>The Chancellor suggested that one sentence be added to the communiqué to
                            the effect that the question of Berlin and Germany had been touched upon
                            in the general discussion.<note n="5" xml:id="d154fn5">For text of the

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> then asked whether it
                            might not be advisable for the Germans to draw up another memorandum
                            outlining Western Germany’s views with reference to a separate peace
                            treaty and general German-Soviet relations.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor jumped in to say that as long as the Cuba situation was
                            not settled no such steps should be taken.</p>
                        <p>The President also indicated that he could not see the advantage of any
                            such action and that it would be best to wait for Soviet reaction before
                            any steps are undertaken on the side of the West.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State pointed out that it was important to note that all
                            during the Cuban crisis both Moscow and <persName corresp="#p_UW1"
                                >Ulbricht</persName> had been very quiet about Berlin. They had not
                            stirred up any excitement about it in their public speeches. Perhaps
                            they had been caught off timing in general, or perhaps off their timing
                            on Berlin; and therefore, perhaps, they wanted to wait and see what
                            would happen.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said that West
                            Germany had received only one indication from a representative from the
                            Soviet Zone to the effect that the matter of the draft treaty was not
                            acute at this time.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor reiterated that it was clear no move should be undertaken
                            vis-a-vis the Soviet Union until the Cuban situation became clear,
                            because any such step on the part of the partners of the US might be
                            interpreted as criticism of US measures, and the West could not afford
                            to have this impression created. The Secretary of State stated that it
                            was well to continue the talk about the 8-point program but he warned
                            the German representatives to be careful about what they said about any
                            possibility of formal recognition of two Germanys. That was, after all,
                            a major trump to be played at the very end.</p>
                        <p>The President, in closing, stated that when the Soviets had tried to
                            insert new topics in the discussions on the Cuba question between
                            Kuznetsov and <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>,<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d154fn6">Documentation on these discussions at the United

                                    >volume XI</ref>.</note> they had been told repeatedly that we
                            refused to discuss anything in these talks except Cuba. Therefore it was
                            wise, as agreed, to refrain from raising any other issues with the
                            Soviets until after the settlement of the Cuban crisis. This was a
                            protection for the US.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor indicated that he considered this standpoint correct.</p>

                        <p>I think that on the plebiscite question you should continue to try to
                            develop unified German proposals, as we agreed in our conversation here

                            such a plebiscite. With regard to access questions I agree that we
                            should give high priority to resolving differences in viewpoint as
                            quickly as possible. It is imperative that the contingency planning in

                        <p>It is also too early to tell what effect recent events may have on a new

                            after that, I agree, there may be some chance of more realistic talks,

                        <p>As I said yesterday, I am gravely disturbed by reports about the level of
                            German defense expenditures, and I want to state my concern <pb n="445"
                                xml:id="pg_445" facs="0467"/>frankly. It appears that the German
                            defense budgets for 1962 and 1963, as they now stand, will not finance
                            the scheduled build-up of German forces to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>-agreed force goals, and will not meet the scheduled
                            payments for military goods and services received from the United States
                            under the <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> agreement.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d156fn1">Not further identified.</note></p>
                        <p>A high state of readiness of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            forces—and most particularly those of Germany and the United States—is
                            essential if we are to be able to defend Berlin. This requires all of us
                            to maintain the necessary level of defense expenditures. We cannot talk
                            with firmness unless we act with firmness.</p>
                        <p>We, for our part, despite a serious balance of payments problem, are
                            maintaining major military forces in Europe which, in Germany alone,
                            entail an annual United States balance-of-payments expenditure of about
                            $700 million. We feel we have the right to expect Germany, in turn, to
                            do its full share.</p>
                        <p>The arrangements under which Germany is procuring military goods and
                            services from the United States have mutual advantages; they enable the
                            Federal Republic to procure these items at the lowest costs, and they
                            help to offset the balance-of-payments costs of United States defense
                            expenditures in Germany. If the Federal Republic did not meet its part
                            of the military procurement arrangement this year, important payments
                            which the United States expects during the rest of this year would be
                            postponed. This would not only add to our balance-of-payments deficit;
                            it would have destructive psychological effects.</p>
                        <p>I trust the German Government will meet both its <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> commitments and its procurement arrangements with us.
                            We understand this will require an immediate supplemental appropriation
                            of two billion D-Marks to the 1962 German defense budget, and a
                            comparable supplemental figure to the 1963 budget. We believe total
                            German resources are ample to meet these needs, if the necessary
                            measures are taken. We are sure the German people will respond
                            generously if the real nature of the need is made clear to them by an
                            act of political leadership.<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">On December 12

                                    they have embarked upon a fairly radical course of policy change
                                    within which eventual discussions on Berlin would fall into
                                    natural place, or (b) more likely, in absence of such broad
                                    policy change, reopen talks on Berlin within the framework of
                                    previous exchanges but possibly with some changes in past

                                    we want to take advantage of opportunity provided by <persName

                                <item>A solid settlement in Berlin on terms that keep the city free
                                    and viable is a target of high priority for us, and we do not
                                    wish to miss any opportunity that may now exist for a Berlin
                                    settlement. You should maintain the position that since the
                                    Soviet Government started the Berlin crisis, the initative for
                                    new proposals should rest with Moscow, but you should leave no
                                    doubt that we are much interested in a workable settlement. You
                                    should point out that we see no good in facing difficult
                                    negotiations with Germans and French except in terms of a real
                                    prospect of settlement.</item>

                                <item>As we see it, there are two broad possibilities for such a
                                    settlement. One is a de facto continuation of the status quo, in
                                    which any <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0469"/>peace treaty
                                    would leave the real situation unchanged, and each side would
                                    interpret the position in its own way. This is probably easier
                                    to negotiate but less satisfactory for the long pull than a
                                    broader settlement. The terms of a wider agreement must include
                                    for us plainly acknowledged right of Western troop presence and
                                    improved access rights like those proposed under our
                                    international access authority. A number of adjustments of
                                    interest to the Soviets could be made in return for improved
                                    access and wholly accepted presence. Without communicating all
                                    of the above to <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName>,
                                    you should make it plain to him that any Berlin settlement which
                                    shifts from the status quo must include advantages for us as
                                    well as for them, and that the advantages of greatest interest
                                    to us are improved access and a wholly acknowledged right of
                                    Western presence. It would be appropriate to indicate that we
                                    would be interested in knowing how Soviets would construct a
                                    wider agreement including these two features.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>Since <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> will
                                    probably not be able to respond immediately to this hint, you
                                    should also endeavor to draw him out as to the significance of
                                    his remark that the Cuban crisis was not without its
                                    implications for German problem. As you know, lessons which
                                    Soviets have presumably drawn from Cuban experience have been
                                    subject of considerable speculation but of little hard
                                    information. One line which had been put out through both
                                    satellite and direct sources is that lesson of Cuba is that, if
                                    both sides are prepared to make concessions as in Cuban case,
                                    then similar willingness of both sides to make concessions on
                                    Berlin should likewise lead to resolution of that problem.
                                    Should Senenov take this position, you might point out that, in
                                    discussions of past 16 months, we have already indicated a
                                    number of areas in which West has indicated willingness to make
                                    accommodations. However, compromise cannot extend to what we
                                    have defined as our vital interest in Berlin situation, although
                                    even here we are willing to look at situation in endeavor to
                                    examine modalities provided any changes are consistent with
                                    safeguarding of those vital interests.</item>

                                <item>A further point which it might be useful to probe would be
                                    role now assigned to peace treaty by Soviets. We have noted
                                    recent deemphasis of peace treaty in both Soviet and <gloss

                                    interested in your impressions from talking with him that this
                                    is definitely on back burner.</item>

                                    face-saver for Soviets while Allied troop presence and guarantee
                                    remain, this proposal is of real interest to us. A major purpose
                                    of your talks with <persName corresp="#p_SVS1"
                                        >Semenov</persName> should therefore be to ascertain whether
                                    this suggestion represents a real shift in the Soviet position
                                    or is merely a device for limiting both the duration and the
                                    effectiveness of Western presence. You should make it clear that
                                    we cannot express any judgment on what they have in mind until
                                    they have spelled it out. You might, for example, seek to
                                    determine what the Soviets have in mind among such possibilities
                                    (without offering them a catalog for shopping) as following: (a)
                                    simple registration of any agreement on Berlin with <gloss
                                        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, (b) agreement to report to

                                    size, composition, and activities of forces in Berlin, (c) some
                                    form of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representation and
                                    authority in West Berlin, (d) some new status involving West
                                    Berlin request for Allied troops under some <gloss
                                        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> umbrella, (e) a move of elements
                                    of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> itself to West Berlin, (f)
                                    a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role in other respects than
                                    troop presence—as for example access or perforation of wall. You
                                    should probe as to the role and authority of West Berlin Senat,
                                    Western garrisons, and Federal Republic under any such
                                    arrangements. In all this, you should make it clear that we

                                    and we repeat that you should avoid any suggestion of a US

                                <item>You are familiar with standard arguments made repeatedly by

                                    arguments as appropriate. We would want to avoid giving

                            them. In talking with them, you should be careful to avoid giving
                            impression that you are in any way negotiating rather than engaging
                            purely in probing operation on informal basis at Soviet initiative.
                            President is dubious about possibility of carrying out really useful
                            exchanges with Soviets if we follow usual procedure of full briefings

                            this has led either to leaks and public discussion <pb n="449"

                        <p>Turning from the discussion on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said he had another
                            question to raise. The Cuban question, he observed, could have brought
                            us to nuclear war, but now the crucial period was over and we should be
                            able to settle this question peacefully. However, there was a second
                            question which could lead us to war, and this is Germany. We have
                            consulted with, and submitted many proposals to our World War II Allies.
                            Two or three years have <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0472"/>passed
                            during which there have been extensive negotiations with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> in Moscow and
                            between the Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>. This has brought about considerable progress.
                            When Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> complained about the Soviet
                            ultimatum of six months in the first Soviet proposal on Germany and said
                            it could not possibly be worked out in this time, the Soviet Union had
                            not insisted. Moreover, it was not an ultimatum. A time limit is not as
                            important for us as the willingness of our World War II Allies to
                            finalize this question. Looking back, we do not regret postponing the
                            issue because in our discussions certain progress has been made.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union could not, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1"
                                >Mikoyan</persName> continued, go beyond the proposals already made
                            by Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. The
                            Soviet Union was concerned by the presence of Western troops in Berlin.
                            He would like to ask a question: since the Western powers were not
                            making new proposals, or apparently making any constructive efforts, did
                            the United States think that this situation could be frozen in
                            perpetuity? Did the United States expect the occupation forces to remain
                            in West Berlin for all time? All these questions were legitimate but the
                            United States did not answer them. If the Soviet Union became convinced
                            that their World War II Allies don’t want an agreement, then the Soviet
                            Union would proceed alone. It did not wish to do so but we could not
                            live together with an occupation regime in West Berlin and no peace
                            treaty. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>
                            concluded, he would not repeat the thoughts in Chairman <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s messages to the President
                            on this subject.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that we had had many discussions in the past but he
                            was glad to tell Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> of
                            our position. In the course of these past discussions a number of points
                            had arisen on which considerable progress had been made. We had tried to
                            meet the USSR in a spirit of reciprocity. Now we have come to a point
                            where in trying to meet the Soviet Union on one point, it is then set
                            aside and the USSR moves on to another point. In all frankness, more
                            genuine reciprocity from the Soviet side is needed. For example, we were
                            told East Berlin cannot be discussed, i.e., Allied interests in East
                            Berlin are not for discussion. We were told we must discuss West Berlin.
                            This position reflects an absence of the spirit of reciprocity. We have
                            said for years that the presence of Western troops and a guaranteed
                            freedom for Berlin is a vital interest of the United States. We haven’t
                            said that this situation will be perpetuated for eternity. We would like
                            to see a peace treaty for all Germany and we have made many proposals,
                            but we are faced with the fact of disagreement between us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> asked on what basis
                            did the United States intend to keep its troops in West Berlin and for
                            how long.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded that time limits were difficult to talk about
                            except in terms of a general settlement of the German question. At this
                                <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0473"/>point there is a sharp
                            difference between the Soviet Union and the United States. This can be
                            managed so as not to produce other crises while we proceed to other
                            questions which might help our relations. In this way time can be of
                            help, and in the long run will improve the possibilities of agreement.
                            Also the time factor can be affected by relations between the East and
                            West Germans, for instance, in the matter of trade, which would indicate
                            they were prepared to live in peace. Again time would be a factor when
                            the West Berliners no longer have the threat of a man with opinions and
                            objectives like <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> hanging
                            over them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that our approach had been broadly along three
                            lines: First, to settle the German question as a whole, which would mean
                            the end of the occupation; secondly, recognizing existing facts, of
                            which there are three important elements—the existence of East Germany,
                            West Germany and West Berlin; thirdly, given the fact of disagreement,
                            we must consider how we might manage this problem in order to promote
                            the possibilities of agreement in the long run, but handle the fact of
                            disagreement peacefully. This was one of the reasons why we had proposed
                            Deputy Foreign Ministers. Unfortunately, we had not been able to reach
                            agreement on any of these three variants. Both of our countries possess
                            great power and Berlin was important to both. Therefore we must prepare
                            to discuss the question with great care. We feel that if the Soviet
                            approach is the same, we can find a way to deal with this issue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said the Secretary’s
                            last remark was constructive and he entirely shared it. With many of the
                            Secretary’s past remarks he could not agree. West Berlin was situated in
                            the territory of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. East Berlin is
                            the capital city of a sovereign state. Accordingly, by all the rules,
                            West Berlin should be considered a part of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>, and it could have claimed West Berlin. But the USSR
                            and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, understanding the position
                            of the Western Powers, had agreed that West Berlin remain a special unit
                            without becoming part of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. There
                            was no intention to interfere with West Berlin unless it became a member
                            of military pacts. The Soviet Union had agreed to talk with the United
                            States on how to finish the occupation status. It would be much better
                            if a peace treaty were signed by all the Allies against Germany in World
                            War II, but if this were not possible, because of the stubbornness of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> or other Western
                            Allies, the Soviet Union could sign a separate treaty. But the Soviet
                            Union would prefer to find an agreed solution. Time does settle
                            questions, but time can also create contradictions and explosions can
                            occur. The Berlin and German questions have been delayed for a long time
                            but such delay makes the situation more dangerous. The United States
                            should give more thought to its position but it should not delay too
                            long.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we were prepared to go into this question at any time.
                            If there was introduced an element of genuine reciprocity, he <pb
                                n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0474"/>thought a solution could be
                            found. However, he felt that we had had agreements in the past on
                            questions with the USSR but these agreements haven’t lasted very long.
                            In this connection the Secretary referred to the 1945 agreements when
                            Allied troops had withdrawn from a considerable portion of East Germany,
                            and to the 1949 agreements which through certain events we felt had been
                            violated to some degree. The United States wants to remove Berlin and
                            Germany as a constant source of difficulties, but we must recognize the
                            difficulty in finding a solution.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wanted to comment on Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>’s remark about delay. The
                            United States is not attempting to delay discussions. The delays which
                            have occurred are bilateral responsibility. One can always hurry into a
                            crisis, but it is much better if we can find a way to resolve this
                            question without a crisis. The Secretary said he was confident that he
                            could speak for President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                            in that he wants to find a satisfactory solution to this issue. Both the
                            Soviet Union and the United States have many other things to do for
                            their peoples.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> responded that in
                            order to find an end to this issue, questions must be discussed. The
                            President should not expect from the Soviet Union additional proposals.
                            The Soviet Union expects constructive proposals from the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed the United States had made quite a few proposals
                            but received the reply that these could not be discussed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said it was really the
                            other way around and urged that the United States think the situation
                            over. The Soviet Union believes that there must be movement ahead. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> disclaimed any
                            intention of conducting negotiations, but he wanted the Secretary to
                            understand the seriousness of this issue for the USSR.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed the hope that Moscow would give a great deal of
                            thought to this issue; indeed all of the Powers concerned must give hard
                            thought to it. Referring to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1"
                                >Mikoyan</persName>’s remark about <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName>, the Secretary emphasized that the United
                            States was not speaking on behalf of our Allies or their interest, but
                            rather of the vital interests of the United States. It would be a great
                            mistake to think the United States was paralyzed or tongue-tied by the
                            attitude of one or more of its Allies. The United States still hoped
                            that progress could be made on this issue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> jokingly remarked “so
                            there is an independent policy of the United States”. He concluded by
                            remarking that Soviet interests and ours could be reconciled, which was
                            a good omen.</p>

                                corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> said peaceful resolution of

                            be solved. I noted that question of <gloss target="#t_GB1">G/B</gloss>
                            not really dwelt on in exchange of letters, but only one element
                            entering into discussions of past year seemed to be singled out, namely
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact relationship.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> replied this did not
                            lessen urgency of resolution problem West Berlin since forces involved

                                <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> has gone but his
                            theme remains with Weinstein serving as principal instrument of pursuit
                            this policy. I said I had many discussions with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> and never heard anything along
                            lines mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out US interest is workable solution of Berlin problem. Thus
                            far, however, USSR proposed four formulae which emphasized word
                            “temporary” and which constituted variation on theme to oust US from
                            West Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> said that
                            this view incorrect and that Soviets not attempting get someone out of
                            Berlin and assured me this is view of Soviet Government. If he reported
                            to Soviet leaders that aim was to oust US, they would say it isn’t so.
                            It is not question of pushing US out but normalizing situation in West
                            Berlin. I itemized four formulae presented by Soviets and said these
                            contained no element of compromise. They all involved the withdrawal of
                            Western forces either now or in future. <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454"
                                facs="0476"/>Such an event would completely remove protection now
                            accorded West Berlin and this was certainly one of most dangerous
                            developments that could occur in Central Europe.</p>
                        <p>Recalling previous conversations, <persName corresp="#p_SVS1"
                                >Semenov</persName> said political-social system in East Berlin same
                            as in <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. On other hand, West Berlin
                            has social system differing completely with that within <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Thus there are now three separate
                            entities in Germany, consisting of West Germany, <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> and West Berlin. An attempt must be made to assure
                            peaceful coexistence these three entities. One can only speak of
                            protection when an attack against something is contemplated, which is
                            not the case. USSR believes West Berlin should be free and independent
                            as long as sovereign rights <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            protected. Neither USSR nor <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> has
                            slightest need for West Berlin and both are prepared provide guarantees
                            to West Berlin. US believes guarantees should be in form of troop
                            contingents. Although USSR does not think so, it is willing to meet US
                            half way. US side itself has said troops should not remain in West
                            Berlin ad infinitum; therefore US also recognizes principle of
                            temporariness of troops. In essence question is one of peaceful
                            coexistence in which both sides will observe international obligations.
                            USSR wishes to see greater degree of trust and to insure that events do
                            not lead to explosion. Latest events attest to fact that this is
                            reasonable position.</p>
                        <p>I agreed trust desirable if explosion to be avoided. Speaking frankly,
                            however, Cuban situation has improved matters in this regard. Our aim
                            must be seek guarantees which are obvious and self-enforcing. In broader
                            context, problem is less how several parts divided Germany will live
                            together than how US and USSR will live side by side. USSR can have
                            peaceful existence in this area and has it at moment because both sides
                            are observing mutual obligations. Attempt by USSR however to oust
                            Western presence from West Berlin contrary to mutual obligations and
                            peaceful coexistence. If two sides can’t coexist peacefully in Berlin,
                            question arises what this term means.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> said general question of
                            peaceful coexistence between USSR and US involves broad issues which
                            would involve wide exchange of views. His personal attitude toward me
                            made such an exchange possible and he would do utmost to have frank
                            discussions, proceeding from normal positions of both governments.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> said developments in
                                <gloss target="#t_GB1">G/B</gloss> are of concern to USSR since they
                            have evolved in abnormal manner. In instances where troops are in direct
                            confrontation with each other, situation could become dangerous should,
                            for example, officer on either side undertake irrational act or should
                            third parties continue their provocations. USSR intends to ensure
                            freedom of West Berlin and to permit it to have ties with all countries.
                            Development should proceed in such way as to preclude collision because
                            this could have dangerous implications, especially since West <pb
                                n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0477"/>Berlin located in heart of
                            Europe. Soviet Union preoccupied by militaristic and revanchist
                            tendencies in both West Germany and West Berlin. USSR worried and
                            preoccupied not because it is afraid but because these forces are
                            seeking to set US and USSR against each other. In past ten years these
                            tendencies have strengthened and problem must be viewed not only with
                            respect to past but with respect future probabilities. USSR doesn’t want
                            situation to develop into thermonuclear war. Therefore remnants World
                            War II must be removed and situation in West Berlin normalized on basis
                            of peace treaty. <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> agreed
                            that both sides have been abiding by international obligations but these
                            obligations entered into as result Second World War and included German
                            settlement. Situation however now changed and new obligations must be
                            undertaken. USSR proposing that both sides undertake new obligations on
                            basis of existing situation. The occupation in West Berlin cannot last
                            forever. Soviet Union ready to assume new obligations and US side has
                            indicated new settlement possible and expedient. In any case, he and I
                            might make useful contribution by weighing what has been said by two
                            sides and bringing positions into accord.</p>
                        <p>On question of peace treaty, I agreed both sides obligated seek peace
                            settlement with Germany. From our point of view, peace treaty with two
                            parts of Germany or separate peace treaty would not represent settlement
                            but legalization of partition of Germany to which US cannot be party. US
                            profoundly believes partition Germany not in Soviet interests since
                            division only sows seeds of revanchism. In my view, peace treaty
                            appeared more a slogan than practical approach to peaceful resolution of
                            problem. I then stated presence Western forces not negotiable. We are in
                            West Berlin by same force circumstances USSR in East Berlin and East
                            Germany. US deeply committed to protection of two and one fourth million
                            West Berliners. We consider troop presence essential guarantee of our
                            commitment. It likely that direct confrontation our troops represents
                            better situation than if Germans confronted one another since latter
                            might not be as responsible as US and USSR. US desires to reach
                            understanding as to how two sides can live together in Central Europe.
                            We could either live as we are or, since Soviets wish to change
                            situation, reach broader modus vivendi which would take into account
                            interests of both sides and lead to more peaceful atmosphere. If Soviets
                            sincere regarding mutual concessions and attempt to solve problem on
                            broader basis, this would interest us. In past sixteen months, Soviet
                            side has not reciprocated US attempts to meet interests which USSR
                            consider vital.</p>
                        <p>After <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> said he did not
                            understand broader measures to which I had referred, I listed items
                            contained in Principles Paper given Soviets at Geneva, noting that these
                            were advanced on assumption Soviets would recognize our vital interests
                            in West Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> noted he
                                <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0478"/>had taken part in recent
                            exchanges of view and added exchanges had not been in vain. A
                            rapprochement had been registered on some questions by two sides and
                            statements of President and Secretary indicated attempt being made to
                            reach mutually acceptable solutions. He commented that my statements
                            seemed step backward, although he appreciated it was sometimes necessary
                            to go back in order to make a big jump ahead.</p>
                        <p>I said key point made by President and Secretary was that US in West
                            Berlin and that we would not get out. Soviets would have to use force to
                            evict us. If Soviets accept fact of our presence in West Berlin as we
                            accept fact of theirs in East Germany and East Berlin, then would be
                            possible for two sides live together in Central Europe.</p>
                        <p>When I asked <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> whether my
                            recollections correct, he answered that I knew as well as he.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> then read statement
                            referred to in <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 1410 and

                        <p>I said I appreciated clarification of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> remarks to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RSF1">Roberts</persName> since they evidently different
                            than <persName corresp="#p_RSF1">Roberts</persName> understood them.
                            Speaking personally, however, I said I didn’t see how this represented
                            concession since it was still aimed at removing our troops from West
                            Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> replied goal is
                            quite different and what is sought is peaceful settlement and
                            normalization of situation in West Berlin. Statement requires careful
                            examination and study in all its aspects and represents concession to
                            US. I then repeated view that US cannot accept peace treaties with two
                            Germanies since this would legalize partition and added that signature
                            of peace treaty by USSR and others with <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> did not represent peaceful settlement German problem.
                            On contrary, it could lead to dangerous provocation of peace. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> then said that US in 1947
                            considered it possible sign peace treaty with separate parts of Germany
                            and that Dulles and Murphy were exponents of this view. Stalin, however,
                            maintained different viewpoint which Soviets now consider to have been
                            mistake. Life has borne out that US was correct. US however has
                            retreated as USSR approached once-held US position. Secondly, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> said USSR wished register
                            existing situation. While US not prepared sign peace treaty under
                            existing circumstances, US has not opposed signature of treaty by USSR
                            and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. USSR believed it good thing to
                            have such questions as frontiers, access and respect for sovereignty
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> agreed upon prior to signature
                            of separate treaty. Soviet <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0479"
                            />Union considered it in its interest to agree on certain arrangements
                            prior to signature separate treaty with <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I said signing of such treaty would be meaningless in itself. However, we
                            consider it dangerous if USSR would thereby try to change US position or
                            Western position in West Berlin and with respect to access. If we could
                            have accord which would protect our vital interests that would be
                            acceptable to us.</p>
                        <p>What concerns us is implied threat that signature of separate peace
                            treaty would bring with it certain consequences which would affect our
                            vital interests. US not seeking to change situation to disadvantage
                            USSR. Dramatic illustration of this attitude demonstrated by our conduct
                            in events of August 13 last year, which we hope will not be
                            misinterpreted. This experience indicated US would not move against USSR
                            where it has physical control. If USSR seeking change, US willing to
                            listen to and study proposals which take our vital interests into
                            account. We are looking for such proposals but haven’t found them. All
                            those advanced attempt to bring a change to our disadvantage.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> said he did not want to
                            repeat Soviet positions and merely wanted to point out that all that has
                            been said by Soviet leaders retains its force. He hoped contacts would
                            be continued in order to bring sides closer together although he was
                            mindful of humility of his position and does not count on possibilities
                            being too great. I noted that I would be going to Paris next week where
                            I would see Secretary. I would send clarification of what <persName

                            <item>On several occasions in the past few months the Joint Chiefs of
                                Staff have expressed their concern to you that little, if any,
                                progress is being made toward a solution of the Berlin problem. At
                                best, our most comprehensive plans aim at a limited objective of
                                return to the status quo ante following some infringement by the
                                Soviets on our vital interests related to Berlin. Recent exhaustive

                                we have extremely limited leverage, short of serious military
                                action, to balance the unfavorable tactical situation resulting from
                                the physical location of Berlin so far within the borders of the
                                Soviet Bloc. Consequently, our necessarily limited responses in the
                                Berlin situation do not consistently convey an adequate impression
                                of our determination to defend our vital interests. This may have
                                influenced Soviet thinking with respect to Cuba. Knowing that you
                                share this concern, the Joint Chiefs of Staff forward in this
                                memorandum the results of a recent Joint Strategic Survey Council

                            <item>The present United States political initiative seeks to take
                                advantage of the lull in Communist aggressive actions against
                                Berlin. Discussions at several diplomatic levels are probing to
                                clarify Soviet intentions and possibly changing policies. Current
                                United States efforts appear to include some degree of international
                                participation in Berlin and its access routes. The Joint Strategic
                                Survey Council study introduces an alternate to the “international”
                                type of solution, and provides a basis for eventually diminishing
                                rather than maintaining our military presence in Berlin. While most
                                of the features in this proposal have previously been considered, as
                                far as we know they have not been presented in a coordinated package
                                in which both the early and later stages have been

                            <item>In forwarding the proposal outlined herein, the Joint Chiefs of
                                Staff would emphasize that any agreement sought for the Berlin
                                problem <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0483"/>must be developed
                                within the framework of continuing struggle between the Free World
                                and the Communist Bloc. The German question is pivotal in this
                                struggle; and West Germany’s economic, political, and military
                                assets remain important ingredients in the power equation. In this
                                context, while the German and Berlin questions represent immediate
                                manifestations of East-West divergencies, they should never be
                                regarded as the basic source of these divergencies. Any plan,
                                including that outlined below, which ignores this premise could be

                                            military, political, and international positions. In
                                            Laos, to illustrate a different situation, both the
                                            United States and the Soviet Union have an interest, but
                                            neither has a vital interest. Neither would welcome a
                                            loss, but either could, if necessary, afford a loss
                                            without irreparable damage to its own security or to its
                                            own network of the international power

                                            there is a sort of equilibrium-of-interests. In the one

                                            therefore, each must consider carefully the effect of
                                            its own moves on the other. In the other case (Laos),
                                            neither has vital interests, and, therefore, neither is
                                            induced to put forth its utmost effort with all forms of

                                            important difference between the two types of interests
                                            is that there is much more freedom of action in the
                                            situations which are not vital. The possible actions and

                                            power has a vital interest are much narrower and at the
                                            same time much more predictable because of the narrowed
                                            range of alternatives.”</item>

                                    necessarily involve a certain degree of disengagement of vital

                                    reverse of the process of involvement of vital interests such as

                            <item>In furtherance of this theme, it is quite apparent that the
                                Soviets, in proposing a treaty with East Germany, are in reality
                                trying to disengage their political vital interests in Berlin by
                                absorbing them into their vital interests in the East German
                                Government. The price they would like us to pay for this is our
                                military withdrawal and sacrifice of our military interests in
                                Berlin. Since they are asking that a military vital interest of the
                                United States be sacrificed for the disengagement of a political
                                vital <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0484"/>interest of the
                                Soviets, the power equation would be out of balance, and the
                                proposition is unacceptable. The only basis on which we can
                                seriously consider negotiations would be that of a political
                                disengagement for a political vital interest or a military
                                disengagement for a military vital interest.</item>

                            <item>To illustrate this thesis, it would be appropriate to reverse the
                                Soviet proposal and offer the Soviets Allied political disengagement
                                in Berlin for a major Soviet military withdrawal (such as their
                                military withdrawal from East Germany). Naturally, this would be as
                                outrageous a proposal to the Soviets as their proposal is to us; for
                                here we would be trading a political vital interest for their
                                military vital interest, and, consequently, the equation would be
                                out of balance. To keep the exchanges equitable, we could offer to
                                accept the Soviet’s East German treaty scheme expanded to include a
                                comparable West German treaty scheme with neither side forsaking its
                                military vital interests. This, then, would result in a political
                                disengagement by both the major powers without the sacrificing of
                                any of their military vital interests.</item>

                            <item>On the face of it, the equation is now in balance. Political
                                disengagement on both sides and military involvement on both sides
                                should be an acceptable solution to each. Some additional safeguards
                                to make it palatable to each will be necessary. For instance,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> has referred
                                to a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact nonaggression
                                agreement; there might be ways in which this could be worked out.
                                But most importantly, the problem of access to Berlin must be firmly
                                nailed down.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item><p>a. If Berlin were on the border, the access problem would be
                                    easy. It is not, and this is the problem. Most suggestions up to
                                    this time have tended toward some sort of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                        >UN</gloss> or other international supervision of access. An
                                    “international” solution would bring more, rather than fewer,
                                    fingers in the pie. Any form of international management would
                                    serve to perpetuate rather than eliminate Berlin as a point of
                                    international friction (the examples of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                        >UN</gloss> interposition in the Gaza Strip, in Korea, in
                                    Laos, and in the Congo all point to this tendency). Therefore,
                                    it is proposed that we move in the other direction, away from
                                    the “international” type of solution. Since Berlin cannot be
                                    brought to the border, we propose taking the border to Berlin by
                                    creating some sort of an umbilical cord, a guaranteed access
                                    corridor, between West Germany and West Berlin controlled only
                                    by West Germans, with no intermediate accesses and no
                                    checkpoints. It is not implied that this guaranteed access
                                    should be the only access; the present water, air, rail, and
                                    road accesses could and should be continued with detailed
                                    arrangements worked out by the West and East Germans on the
                                    basis of their mutual self interests. But the insurance policy,
                                    the umbilical, would have to be in existence in addition to
                                    these. This umbilical cord could perhaps be a long-term lease,
                                    guaranteed by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the
                                    Warsaw Pact, of a strip of land on each <pb n="463"
                                        xml:id="pg_463" facs="0485"/>side of an existing autobahn
                                    (with new by-passes around towns and cities); or it might be a
                                    new autobahn, perhaps with a parallel railroad or a monorail,
                                    perhaps even an elevated autobahn, inside a leased strip all the
                                    way from the West German border into West Berlin. Rough cost
                                    estimates are $550 million for an elevated autobahn and less
                                    than that for a new autobahn on the surface. Neither of these is
                                    an exorbitant price for prospect of settlement of this thorny
                                    question, and the cost could be distributed at least between the
                                    United States and West Germany and perhaps throughout <gloss

                                <p>b. The right of way through East Germany could be closed off by
                                    fences, mine fields, or whatever the East Germans may want; and
                                    non-access bridges or tunnels would ensure free East German
                                    crossings. But, whatever the detailed arrangements, this one
                                    insurance access must be guaranteed and must be under the
                                    exclusive control of the West Germans. By this means we have, in
                                    effect, moved West Berlin to the border. This establishment of
                                    the two parts of Germany in juxtaposition to each other with the
                                    basic political barrier of the opposing great powers removed
                                    leads naturally to an evolutionary development of the next step.
                                    We can assume that the arrangement will be peaceful, because it
                                    is guaranteed by both sides. We can hope that, since the
                                    external political barriers would have been removed, the
                                    physical barriers might break down. Inevitably Germans will talk
                                    to Germans and, quite reasonably, interflow between East and
                                    West Germany would develop and should be encouraged.</p></item>

                                A phased back-up, a reduction on a geographic or numerical basis of
                                non-German forces, might be accomplished by substitution of West

                                disengagement by both powers in Berlin. It does not appear practical

                                    offer this proposal today, there are good indications that
                                    thought in West Berlin and West Germany is moving in this
                                    direction. Opportunity to offer it may come in the near future,
                                    and will almost surely come at the time when political forces or
                                    the actuarial tables provide a successor to Chancellor <persName

                                <p>b. It is recognized that use of such a proposal would depend upon
                                    its acceptance by our Allies. The proposal in this study
                                    includes concepts which may require further development. Since
                                    the Berlin problem is under continuous and extensive study
                                    within the United States Government, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                                    suggest that the proposal be transmitted to the Secretary of

                        <p>Let us, Mr. President, eliminate promptly the consequences of the Cuban
                            crisis and get down to solving other questions, and we have them in
                            number. As far as nuclear test ban is concerned this is a minor question
                            on the whole. I am going to address to you a confidential letter and
                            proposals on this question<note n="1" xml:id="d162fn1">For text of this
                                letter, dated December 19, see Department of State <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Bulletin</hi>, February 11, 1963, pp. 198–200.</note> and I
                            hope that we will overcome difficulties existing in this question. The
                            problem of disarmament is a different matter; it is a major and
                            difficult question now.</p>
                        <p>But, of course, the main question is the German question and it is an
                            easy and at the same time difficult one. I say that it is an easy and at
                            the same time difficult question. But this is really so. It is easy
                            because our proposals for concluding a peace treaty do not demand any
                            concessions from either side, neither do they demand any losses from
                            either side. These proposals only fix the situation which has developed
                            as a result of World War II.</p>
                        <p>After the talks that our Minister of Foreign Affairs <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">A. Gromyko</persName> had with your Secretary of
                            State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">D. Rusk</persName>, only one question
                            in effect remained unresolved—that of troops in West Berlin: troops of
                            what countries, for what term and under what flag will be stationed
                            there.</p>
                        <p>I would like you to understand me correctly on this question. Let us
                            solve it. We will not escape the necessity to solve this question
                            anyway. To tell the truth, this question is not worth an eggshell if a
                            realistic approach is employed in appraising the situation in Germany
                            where two sovereign German states have developed and if a course
                            followed is aimed at an agreement on West Berlin and not at leaving it
                            to remain a dangerous hot-bed of collision between states. Should really
                            you and we—two great states—submit, willingly or unwillingly, our
                            policy, the interests of our states to the old-aged man who both morally
                            and physically is with one foot in grave? Should we really become toys
                            in his hands? By concluding peace treaty we would lose nothing but we
                            would gain a possibility to strengthen friendly relations between our
                            states, would untie the knot in Europe which is fraught with danger for
                            the whole world only because most extreme aggressive militarist forces
                            in West Germany are interested in this.</p>

                        <p>After dinner four Foreign Ministers had lengthy private discussion. In
                            larger group, Secretary subsequently summarized conclusions reached
                            noting they had agreed that Ambassadorial Group in Washington should
                            review Berlin contingency plans in order to insure promptest response to
                            Soviet actions. This would include improvement of communications among
                            governments, timing of appointment unified command in Berlin, assembly
                            of Autobahn probe units and timing and application of economic
                            sanctions. Objective would be to reach larger measure of previous
                            agreement among governments. Home commented that with respect economic
                            sanctions emphasis should be on Western response to total blockade of
                            access.</p>

                            crisis management. Goal should be establishment of possibility of
                            conference type consultation between four governments. This might
                            involve teletype system, classified telephones, etc. Our Cuban
                            experience had shown how communications could fall behind requirements.
                            Both sides had had to resort to public statements, as for example
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> on December 28.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> said he hoped
                            communications could be telegraphic rather than telephonic. Secretary
                            commented that technical means for establishing such communications
                            existed. Governments would have to be willing to consider costs. He
                            noted that fairly good communications now existed between Washington and
                            three capitals as well as Bonn and other capitals, but interlocking
                            systems still required. If crisis occurred today he estimated it would
                            take at least six hours to arrange hook-up for conference type
                            discussion between Ministers. More rapid facilities should exist.</p>

                                >NATO</gloss> Ministerial Meeting following day, Ministers concluded
                            there was no need for particular emphasis but that something would have
                            to be said about Berlin in communique, since absence would otherwise be

                        <p>The following are only the highlights of a dinner conversation, as no
                            notes were taken:</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> raised the question of
                            Germany and the Berlin problem and asked if there were anything we ought
                            to be doing. He expressed his own opinion that in view of the attitude
                            of our French and German allies, it did not seem possible for us to take
                            any initiative at the moment—which he thought was a pity. He had hoped
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            conversation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSF1"
                                >Roberts</persName> would have provided a basis for tackling the
                            problem but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had
                            backed away from his own proposal.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> thought that some
                            provision for some <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence in Berlin
                            would be useful in any plan for settlement. He indicated that what he
                            had in mind was moving various bits and pieces of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> organizations to West Berlin. He also touched upon the
                            question of what flag Western troops would be under.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> expressed the
                            view that although the Soviets had made much of the troop issue, the
                            heart of the matter was their desire for greater recognition of the
                            sovereignty of East Germany and their desire to establish greater
                            stability in that area.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> gave a long
                            exposé of his views on the German problem upon which the Prime Minister
                            congratulated him after dinner, describing it as a brilliant
                            presentation. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>
                            thought <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0491"/>any prospects for
                            German reunification were virtually nil. He discussed the possibility of
                            an all-Berlin solution and thought personally that one of the few
                            possibilities of a settlement which might work would be to move the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> headquarters to Berlin. He paid
                            tribute to the role Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> had played in keeping postwar Germany on the
                            right track.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName>
                            pointed out that an important factor in the situation was the psychology
                            of the population of West Berlin. He did not think that they would feel
                            secure unless American and other Western troops remained and did not
                            believe they would consider we had upheld our commitment to them if the
                            security of Berlin were turned over to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>The President said he wondered if we were not making a mistake in always
                            treating the Soviet leaders with consideration and courtesy.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said he
                            thought that our doing so had a definite effect for the good on Soviet
                            policy. He pointed out that the orthodox communist view was that the
                            capitalist—or, as they would call it imperialist world—was out to
                            destroy them. Moreover, they were extremely sensitive and had a
                            deep-seated inferiority complex. It was therefore important to get
                            across to them that we were prepared to negotiate as equals. He cited
                            the fact that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had
                            on a number of occasions, publicly and privately, referred to the fact
                            that President Eisenhower had called him “friend.”</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question from <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord
                                Home</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                                >Thompson</persName> said he thought that the Soviets would try to
                            seek an agreement with the West in some other area before bringing the
                            Berlin problem to a head. He thought that in view of the current state
                            of Sino-Soviet relations, that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> must badly want an agreement with the West.
                            He also mentioned the great strain on Soviet resources. He said he
                            thought we should not take any initiative on Berlin at this time but
                            should be preparing the position we would adopt when the Soviets did
                            seriously raise the matter again, as he felt certain they would before
                            many months had passed.</p>
                        <p>The President said the Soviets had had many opportunities to settle the
                            Berlin problem but had, in the past year, gone even further out on a
                            limb by making an issue of the presence of Western troops.</p>

                            <item>In response to your request for my views on the subject paper, I
                                think it is an imaginative initiative which deserves a decent
                                hearing that it is not likely to receive. Attached at Tab A is a
                                brief memorandum on the paper which I sent to Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> on 12 December, hoping to
                                stimulate his interest without asking him to focus on the entire
                                paper itself.<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">Not printed.</note> As you
                                will see from my memorandum to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2"
                                    >Bundy</persName>, I think that the paper represents the sort of
                                proposition which, even though it may appear initially to be
                                “non-negotiable”, in the sense that the <gloss target="#t_SOV1"

                            <item>Since my 12 December memorandum to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2"
                                    >Bundy</persName>, I have talked further with Mr. <persName

                                the “Old Chinese Hands” of yesteryear, in that they have been in the

                            <item>Paragraphs 10 and 11 strike me as “pussyfooting” a little, at a
                                point where I think the paper should call a spade a spade. In my
                                view, <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0493"/>the paper should be
                                crystal clear at this point in the development of its logic that
                                what the paper is proposing is a stark withdrawal of all US, UK,
                                French, and Soviet troops from both Berlins, and, what is more, I
                                think that this withdrawal or disengagement feature should be made a
                                part of the initial package offer to the Soviets. The reason for
                                this latter view of mine is that it would increase the likelihood of
                                Soviet acceptance or serious consideration, and would also tend to
                                pull the teeth of some of the opponents of the paper, such as Mr.

                            complete break would be prefaced by purge of pro-Chinese elements in

                            papers are quadripartitely agreed.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> raised question of US
                            attitude toward <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> initiative on Berlin
                            in light of sentence in Cuba agreement on “other subjects.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said US had no formal
                            position as yet, but obviously we did not want to take “too negative”
                            position if <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s really want serious
                            discussion. For the moment, however, we see no such <gloss
                                target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> desire. <persName corresp="#p_AH9"
                                >Alphand</persName> replied that while French see no threat from
                                <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s neither do they see any change
                            in <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> positions, thus no new openings
                            for Berlin negotiations are available to West.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> then read what were
                            obviously Bonn instructions on negotiations. Exploratory talks have been
                            “fruitless” and thus there is no reason go into negotiations. Should
                                <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s indicate willingness resume
                            exploratory talks, West should insist on precondition that Western
                            troops remain West Berlin. This means remain under present conditions
                            and not for an interim period or under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            flag. If Soviets accept this precondition, West should begin
                            negotiations with maximum rather than minimum proposal but one which
                            should appeal to public and enhance ability to reach modus vivendi.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> replied that <gloss
                                target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s unlikely accept this precondition.
                            Also pointed out that US has continually made clear to <gloss
                                target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s in all talks that Western troop
                            presence not negotiable. On maximum negotiating position, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> noted Secretary’s belief we
                            might go back to all-Berlin proposals to remind <gloss target="#t_SOV1"
                                >Sov</gloss>s that East Berlin is also negotiating material.
                            However, problem of advancing a maximum position which is also credible
                            must be faced.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Kuznetsov</persName> observed that as he had said to the
                            President yesterday,<note n="1" xml:id="d167fn1">A memorandum of
                                    <persName>Kuznetsov</persName>’s conversation with the President
                                at 5 p.m. on January 9, devoted to Cuba, is scheduled for
                                publication in <ref target="frus1961-63v11">volume XI</ref>.</note>
                            the USSR and the United States must put more effort into the attempt to
                            solve outstanding international problems. He said that he had mentioned
                            the two most important as those of a German peace treaty and general and
                            complete disarmament. With regard to Germany, he wished to stress that
                            in the Soviet view the necessity of solving this question <pb n="475"
                                xml:id="pg_475" facs="0497"/>and removing the last traces of World
                            War II must have priority as life requires this. It was clear, in Europe
                            at least, he said, that without a solution of this problem a hotbed of
                            war will continue to exist. The situation is now ripe for the conclusion
                            of a German peace treaty. In fact, the viewpoints of the two sides are
                            now much closer than they were a couple of years ago. It is now possible
                            to reach an agreement and very little remains to be done. If both
                            governments show a sincere desire, it should not take long to come to an
                            agreement. Such an agreement would be useful for lessening tension in
                            Europe while the problem of disarmament would be easier of solution.
                                <persName>Kuznetsov</persName> added that he was not linking the
                            German and disarmament problems.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would not attempt to review the 100 hours of
                            talks on Berlin and Germany which had taken place over the last year or
                            two. He would, however, urge again that Moscow approach the problem of
                            Berlin with a general sense of reciprocity. What has caused the United
                            States difficulty, he said, had been aptly expressed by the President’s
                            expression “What is mine is mine; what is yours is negotiable”. Looking
                            back to 1945, the Secretary observed, and throughout the whole postwar
                            period there have been very few bilateral issues between the United
                            States and the USSR. The great issues involved someone else and if these
                            latter could be resolved, the strictly bilateral aspects of our
                            relations would be a relatively simple matter.</p>
                        <p><persName>Kuznetsov</persName> commented that with regard to the German
                            problem the USSR has made many proposals. The United States has only to
                            take its choice among them. He asked that the United States bear this in
                            mind and said that it was now the turn of the United State to advance
                            proposals.</p>

                        <p>Obvious purpose this campaign is to accredit notion that US has been

                                >Brandt</persName> meeting East Berlin evening Jan 17 or 18.
                            Tripartitely agreed Allied formula was along following lines: That we
                            knew that <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> was aware, as
                            were we, of certain disadvantages in making such visit; nevertheless we
                            left it up to <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> to decide
                            whether or not to go. This formula arrived at after unilateral
                            consultations with Ambassadors in Bonn and based on strong views here
                            that Allies should put decision squarely up to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>. Allied lack of enthusiasm for
                            adventure has indeed been unilaterally expressed previously to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> by French Ambassador (via
                            Foreign Office) in Bonn, British Ambassador in Berlin and by three
                            Deputy Commandants.</p>
                        <p>It was also agreed that Rouse would tell <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> that if he decided go ahead with visit,
                            conditions he mentioned to Rouse yesterday were satisfactory: that
                            meeting would not be in <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> Embassy; no
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_SED1"
                                >SED</gloss> representatives should attend; and <persName

                            he was spokesman for Allies.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> told Rouse that
                            Chancellor’s reaction was very similar to Allies, that is, that he had
                            some reservations but decision was up to <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName>. At <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName>’s request, Rouse mentioned several of the
                            disadvantages from the Allied point of view but reiterated no pressure
                            intended and decision was for <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> to make. He also specifically stated on behalf of
                            Allies that replies to press inquiries re Allied involvement would
                            follow closely formula outlined above.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said he had not made up
                            his mind but would inform Rouse his decision later in afternoon. Rouse
                            informed me 1500 hours <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>
                            decided accept and is proposing meeting 1930 this evening. He is laying
                            down certain conditions based on those mentioned above. If meeting
                            arranged, Senat plans issue brief press announcement. Interpreter from

                            would be detrimental to German/Soviet relations; hence Chancellor
                            advised <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> “to make personal

                            me now.</p>
                        <p>He wished say, however, that Sov Govt considers its proposals good basis
                            for agreement which take into account interests of all parties,
                            including USSR and USA. Those who think question of German peace
                            settlement has lost its topicality and urgency would be making great
                            mistake. Soviets had emphasized and continue now to emphasize that
                            German peace treaty and settlement on this basis of problem of West
                            Berlin remain urgent and acute.</p>
                        <p>Sov Govt had set no date for peace treaty. It was better not to close
                            door to negotiations on this subject. If US or its Allies should
                            conclude from this that problem was not urgent, they would be making big
                            mistake.</p>
                        <p>Sov Govt was proceeding from assumption that statements which US Govt had
                            made regarding desirability of continuing talks, particularly during his
                            conversations with Secretary remain in force.</p>
                        <p>However, Sovs cannot understand why certain leading American

                            of views must be continued. That is right. That was positive side his
                            statement. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> understood it
                            to mean that US was ready continue talks with view to reaching
                            agreement. But Secretary also said this only in very general way,
                            without taking it to logical conclusion, i.e., that talks should be
                            renewed soon and should not be delayed.</p>
                        <p>If Sovs were to name a date as term during which talks should be
                            completed, that would complicate question for both sides. Sov Govt
                            proceeded from assumption that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            remains ready to talk. If this is so, talks should be resumed and
                            exchange of views should continue.</p>
                        <p>When interpreter had finished translating this, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he had “additional
                            explanation”: Sov Govt emphasized importance of settlement
                            Germany/Berlin, since this would strengthen confidence between states
                            and would increase possibility for favorable solution of disarmament
                            problems. There was lack of confidence in world today. It was necessary
                            settle this problem so progress could be made on disarmament.</p>
                        <p>At end his presentation, I said I should of course report his remarks
                            immediately and fully. Without getting into discussion of
                            Germany/Berlin, I wanted to confirm that US is interested in reaching
                            understanding which would reduce tensions in Central Europe. As
                            Secretary had told him, we do not consider there can be any question of
                            unilateral procrastination when two sides are attempting to reach
                            agreement. Soviets had put forward some proposals and so had we, but we
                            had had no response to our proposals. This was mutual
                            responsibility.</p>
                        <p>I said we had noticed in recent Soviet statement on subject some
                            indications that Sovs might be ready to take our vital interests more
                            fully into account, e.g., on troop question. If Soviet side had any
                            concrete suggestions to make, I was prepared to take them back to
                            Washington with me.</p>

                        <p>We should find acceptable talks in Washington, through Soviet Ambassador,
                            or here, in Moscow, through Ambassador of USA. If American side agrees
                            that exchange of views should be continued in Moscow, we should welcome
                            that.</p>
                        <p>Of course, we are ready to receive other special American

                            problem President of USA might find useful.</p>
                        <p>Soviet Government will give instructions to its representatives to
                            continue discussion of concrete questions, relating to German peace

                        <p>The Secretary said it was necessary to consider the recent overtures
                            about Berlin which the Soviets had made to Ambassador <persName

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> cautioned against any
                            haste. There seemed to be no present danger of a separate treaty. The
                            posture of Western unity was not imposing at the moment. Moreover, as
                            the President had said in November,<note n="2" xml:id="d173fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d153">Document 153</ref>.</note> the USSR must clearly
                            accept Western presence in Berlin. On this last point the USSR was still
                            rather evasive, apparently having said nothing about it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary clarified that what the President meant in November was
                            that no arrangement could be concluded that did not accept Western
                            presence in Berlin. The President did not insist that such recognition
                            be a precondition to discussions. We seemed to feel we should not talk
                            under pressure and that it was not necessary to talk if things were
                            quiet.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> said this was the
                            situation we all had to live with in view of Berlin’s exposed and
                            isolated position. This tactic had been successful so far.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether there was a danger of steady erosion in
                            Berlin in the absence of clarification of its status.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> replied that an
                            improvement in the situation of Berlin would have a good effect, but it
                            was doubtful we could achieve such improvement. Therefore, it was better
                            to live with what we had. He did not think there was a danger of serious
                            erosion in Berlin. The population had decreased slightly, but this was
                            an inevitable consequence when cities were isolated from their natural
                            hinterlands.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> wondered what the effect
                            would be within the Western Alliance if we did not respond to the Soviet
                            overtures to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                            >Kohler</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> thought there was
                            little hope of finding an agreed basis for negotiations among the
                            members of the Western Alliance as a whole.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted there was a difference between expecting or hoping
                            for a solution and keeping channels open. Our idea in proposing that the
                            Berlin problem be discussed by Deputy Foreign Ministers was simply to
                            keep discussions going, as in the case of Austria.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> said the
                            conversations with the USSR had helped to prevent an erosion of the
                            situation. He thought we should keep the talks going along quietly
                            without being adamant or hasty.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stressed the importance of a united front to keep <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> from getting the wrong
                            ideas. The Secretary referred to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>’s hint that talks should be on a broader basis.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had also said that
                            West Berlin was not important to the Allies who were only echoing
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>. There was also a
                            report that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had told
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> that France did
                            not need West Berlin. To deal with these <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484"
                                facs="0506"/>Soviet tactics, the United States had always stressed
                            its own national interest in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> said there was a
                            question of what should be discussed with the USSR—the German problem or
                            the Berlin problem. There was much in favor of reintroducing the German
                            question.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled this possibility had been discussed among the
                            Foreign Ministers in December.<note n="3" xml:id="d173fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d163">Document 163</ref>.</note> Soviet propaganda
                            emphasized that the USSR alone was making proposals. Perhaps we should
                            present counterproposals at all levels—e.g., All-Germany, All-Berlin,
                            modus vivendi, etc. There was a danger of a psychological erosion in the
                            attitude of the rest of the world toward the Berlin question. If the
                            USSR proposed changes in the status quo for its purposes, why should we
                            not propose changes for our purposes?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> said such an approach
                            would have the advantage of reintroducing the proposals made by the West
                            in 1959 about Germany. He emphasized that there was more confidence in
                            West Berlin now as a result of Cuba than there had been at any time in
                            the last four years.</p>

                            discussion with Chancellor yesterday, which lasted almost two hours,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> charged that US had

                            Soviets had become tougher. However, he thought there were two reasons
                            for this, and that in addition to French-UK-US differences over Brussels
                            negotiations and Nassau, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had also been encouraged by <persName

                            his agreement with President last November, in view of which he had been
                            “amazed” to learn that before <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                >Kohler</persName> left Moscow, he had asked <persName

                            two days later to say that Soviets wished to resume discussions over

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> replied that he did not
                            agree with Chancellor’s interpretation and that what actually happened
                            was clearly initiative by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            and not by <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, who had merely
                            made usual routine inquiry, as any other Ambassador, leaving for

                        <p>Most of meeting with <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> taken
                            up by lengthy and frequently emotional discourse by Chancellor on long
                            history of Franco-German relations, including strong defense of recent
                            reconciliation and treaty. As result, there was virtually no discussion

                            bilateral discussions on Germany and Berlin. The President said he was
                            concerned because the Germans and the French were not in favor of
                            further exploratory talks and, given Chancellor <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>’s present mood and suspicions,
                            the Chancellor could at any time attempt to exploit these discussions to
                            our detriment.<note n="1" xml:id="d175fn1">At the Ambassadorial Group

                                    Gore</persName> reported that the United Kingdom favored an

                                not oppose further exploratory conversations with the Soviet Union.
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> stressed
                                how awkward it would be for the United States to say it was not
                                ready to talk and informed the group that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> would be instructed to
                                discover the Soviet position before proceeding further. (Telegram

                                28 Berlin)</note> The President said for our own protection it was
                            necessary to have the French and the Germans as fully locked into these
                            talks as possible. He suggested that if this were not possible, we might
                            tell the Soviets that we could not carry on with the talks in the
                            absence of Allied support.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary argued that discussions with the Soviets on Berlin were
                            necessary if only to keep the Berlin situation under control. Moreover,
                            it was important to keep the channels of communication with the Soviets
                            open to determine what was in the Soviet mind. In any event, he did not
                            think it possible to refuse to discuss Berlin with the Soviets on the
                            ground that our Allies were opposed to such talks.</p>
                        <p>The President, however, wondered whether there was any advantage in
                            moving ahead without the Germans fully in tow. Unless they were fully
                            locked in, the Germans would be in a position to take advantage <pb
                                n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0509"/>of the accomplishments of the
                            talks, but remain ever ready to criticize us if things went wrong. The
                            President also questioned whether there was any real advantage in
                            putting ourselves in an exposed position vis-a-vis our Allies in the
                            absence of indications that the Soviets were prepared to come up with
                            constructive Berlin proposals. He asked whether a more profitable course
                            might be to try to get from <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> some indication of Soviet thinking before again
                            raising the question of Berlin discussions with the Allies. Unless the
                            Soviets were prepared to be forthcoming, he saw no useful purpose in
                            continuing a dialogue bound to arouse the suspicion, even the
                            antagonism, of our Allies.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> interjected
                            to say that it would be awkward for the U.S. to say it was not prepared
                            to continue exploratory talks with the Soviets on Berlin. Moreover, if
                            we refused to meet the Soviets’ request now, they could heat up the
                            situation and put us in a position where we would be forced to discuss
                            the problem under pressures they deliberately created.</p>
                        <p>After further discussion, the President laid down the following course of
                            action: <list>

                                    to the Chancellor that we did not relish the idea of talking
                                    with the Kremlin if the Germans objected to our doing so. If the
                                    Chancellor objected to the talks in the context of the <persName

                            swiftly to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> overture, but
                            that if US Govt wishes to resume talks <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> will not oppose. You should make it very clear to the
                            Chancellor that if talks were resumed with the Soviets, we would want to
                            limit their scope to exploring with the Soviet Govt whether a resumption
                            of bilateral exploratory talks could lead to finding a basis for
                            fruitful negotiations. We entirely agree that there should be no
                            negotiations as such unless the Soviets are prepared to recognize the
                            Western troop presence in Berlin without any unacceptable qualification.
                            It seems to us that position now taken by German Govt toward talks is
                            more negative than it was a year ago, and that there is now no
                            difference between the German and French positions <pb n="489"
                                xml:id="pg_489" facs="0511"/>on this point. You should say that the
                            President attaches great importance to close and mutually confident
                            cooperation between him and the Chancellor, and that he has asked you to
                            tell the Chancellor this. If we are to talk to the Soviets at all in
                            response to their initiative, we would like to do so in the knowledge
                            that the German Govt feels that such preliminary exploration is worth
                            undertaking. You should tell the Chancellor that we have delayed sending
                            Amb <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> instructions in order
                            to have this further exchange of views with him, and that we would like
                            to have his completely candid thoughts and suggestions on the matter. If
                            you think it helpful you might point to probability that refusal to talk
                            with Soviets now may result in their increasing pressures on Berlin to
                            force such talks, and this would be less desirable context in which to
                            have exploratory conversations with them. You should say that we don’t
                            relish the idea of talking to the Russians if the Germans are really
                            against our doing so, and if the Chancellor feels that it would be a
                            mistake we would like to review the situation.<note n="2"

                            communication on issues as potentially explosive as Berlin, there is no
                            sound alternative to resumption of talks, now that Soviets have taken
                            initiative.</p>

                            other subject to cover (wide diameter pipe), you should inform him along
                            following lines: 1) US Government has carefully considered statement
                            which Soviet Foreign Minister made during your meeting with him on
                            January 26;<note n="2" xml:id="d177fn2">See <ref target="#d171">Document

                            agrees to resumption bilateral exploratory talks on Berlin and Germany
                            to see whether basis for fruitful negotiations exists; 3) US will not
                            have mandate to speak for three occupying powers in Berlin; 4) we have
                            weighted considerations as to best location for talks and would prefer
                            that they be held in Washington. Since we assume from <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement of January 26 that
                            this would be acceptable, we anticipate that Soviet Government will wish
                            to instruct Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            accordingly.</p>
                        <p>In view of foregoing, believe you will wish to avoid any further
                            discussion of Berlin during meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>. If, however, he insists on making substantive
                            comments, you are sufficiently aware of US position to make appropriate
                            responses within your discretion. While we have not come to final
                            conclusions as to precise tactics which we will follow here, primary
                            objective of any resumed talks must obviously be to ascertain whether
                            Soviet position has in any way softened on vital question of continuing
                            Western troop presence. If <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>’s remarks make this appropriate, you may wish to
                            comment along same lines as reported penultimate para of Moscow’s 1764
                            of January 18,<note n="3" xml:id="d177fn3"><ref target="#d170">Document
                                    170</ref>.</note> noting that, if Soviets have any concrete
                            suggestions to make, they should do so when talks are resumed in
                            Washington.</p>

                            for resumption of talks in Moscow, on balance we have concluded that
                            arguments in favor of Washington, with which you are familiar, seem
                            prevailing at this point. We will, of course, keep you fully informed of
                            all developments, and do not exclude later use of Moscow should this
                            prove desirable.</p>

                                        of Allied traffic at Friedrichstrasse has been observed over
                                        past three months. Signs of Soviet activity commenced second
                                        week in February with their handling of minor train incident
                                        at Marienborn. Incident (dismounting of train commander on
                                        side away from station) was minor in itself but Soviets
                                        raised it with each successive train commander that night
                                        and ultimately called meeting with US checkpoint commander.
                                        Similarly, very minor case of mistaken identity at Helmstedt
                                        Autobahn checkpoint on Feb 16 also led to Soviets calling
                                        similar meeting, even after incident was closed. At this
                                        meeting, however, Soviets reraised train issue and proposed
                                        higher level discussion be held “in Berlin” on that subject.
                                        Finally, on Feb 19, Soviet duty officer at Babelsberg

                            supplementary remark, he said he wished to say that, in SovGovt’s
                            opinion, if there were genuine desire on part <gloss target="#t_USG1"

                            basis for understanding. He said Soviet proposals, as put forward in
                            exchange of views between US and USSR, are good basis for agreement. In
                            supporting these proposals, Soviets did so not simply because they were
                            their own proposals, but, and here he had in mind question of Western
                            troops in West Berlin, because Soviets believe they correspond to
                            interests of USSR, US, Britain, and France. He asked that <gloss

                            without bias, and said that Soviet proposals, including those which had

                            <item>The extent to which they envisage a real change in the status of

                        <p>So long as they maintain an unacceptable position on these two points, I
                            suggest we should avoid getting drawn into any discussion of what kind

                            us to get drawn into a discussion of possible U.N. arrangements in the
                            absence of a Soviet willingness to be realistic about points that are
                            not negotiable for us would merely upset our Allies to no good purpose,
                            would tend to prolong the discussions, and possibly mislead the Soviets
                            into thinking that our position on these matters was not as firm as it
                            actually is. I suggest, however, that without obtaining a Soviet
                            backdown on these points we could, if they are disposed to do so,
                            discuss such matters as access arrangements.</p>
                        <p>In probing on the Soviet U.N. proposal, you might usefully explore, or
                            expose, what they have in mind and what their objectives are. You could
                            stress that Berlin is not a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base,
                            and ask them to explain why they consider it necessary to change the
                            status of our forces there. They have repeatedly stated that they have
                            no military value and that if war were to break out, the more we had
                            there, the better from their point of view, since they would all be
                            easily captured or destroyed. Until Germany <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495"
                                facs="0517"/>is reunified, it can be argued that these troops would
                            be less likely to bring on a conflict than would be the case if East and
                            West German troops were facing each other alone.</p>
                        <p>In what way do they think their removal or weakening would contribute to
                            stability? It is not an answer to this question simply to state that
                            this would draw a line under World War II or would remove a <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base. These troops cannot be used
                            offensively, and the Soviets know it. We cannot help but think that they
                            would like to have the Western presence in Berlin weakened in order that
                            the East Germans could bring pressure on the West Berlin population,
                            discourage them psychologically, and probably eventually arrange for a
                            complete take over. If asked why we consider it necessary to keep them
                            there, the answer might be in the first place to fulfill commitments we
                            have made and, in particular, to see that measures of force, under the
                            guise of strikes or other subterfuges are not employed to subvert or
                            overthrow the present setup in Berlin. By pressing the Soviets to say
                            what it is specifically in the present situation that disturbs them, you
                            may be able to show that what they are working toward is a setup in
                            which they, or the East Germans, could change these things
                            unilaterally—for example, <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss>

                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> read a prepared statement
                            along the following lines (translation from Russian text handed us
                            informally):</p>
                        <p>“In connection with the agreement reached with the Ambassador of the
                            United States in Moscow, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                >Kohler</persName>, the Soviet Government has instructed me to
                            continue, taking into account the exchange of opinions which took place
                            in 1961 and 1962, the discussion of concrete questions in connection
                            with a German peace settlement and normalization of the situation in
                            West Berlin. For its part, the Soviet Government will strive to make the
                            discussion of these questions constructive. It would like to express the
                            hope that this attitude toward the matter will also be shown on the part
                            of the United States and that the exchange of opinions will be concluded
                            in the nearest future with the achievement of the agreement necessary in
                            the interests of strengthening peace and security in Europe.</p>
                        <p>“In the course of the earlier exchange of opinions the parties succeeded
                            in reaching definite results on well-known questions in connection with
                            a German peace settlement. There was also achieved definite mutual
                            understanding concerning the necessity for normalization on this basis
                            of the situation in West Berlin taking into account actually existing
                            conditions which came about on German territory as a result of the past
                            war.</p>
                        <p>“The main question on which it was not possible to overcome differences
                            is the question of the presence of foreign troops in West Berlin. The
                            Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S. Khrushchev</persName>, has pointed out
                            repeatedly that the Government of the USSR in <pb n="498"
                                xml:id="pg_498" facs="0520"/>principle is not against the presence
                            in West Berlin of troops of the three powers, if the Western powers
                            attach importance to this at the present time. However, the troops which
                            may be stationed in West Berlin for purposes of guarantees must be there
                            not under the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> flag, but under the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> flag. Their stay in West Berlin,
                            of course, must not be permanent. The occupation regime in this city has
                            outlived itself, and it must be liquidated. In order to impart a truly
                            international character to the guarantees for West Berlin it is
                            necessary, as the Soviet Government has emphasized many times, to
                            include in the composition of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops
                            in West Berlin also military units of certain other <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> member states, according to an
                            appropriate agreement.</p>
                        <p>“The Soviet Government is convinced that this proposal is a good basis
                            for reaching an agreement on this most difficult and acute question.
                            Unfortunately, the Government of the USA still has not expressed its
                            attitude toward this proposal, and this proposal still has not been
                            subjected to concrete discussion.</p>
                        <p>“The Soviet Government, as in the past, maintains the opinion that the
                            most sensible solution of the question of the normalization of the
                            situation in West Berlin, and a solution which corresponds most to the
                            conditions of peace time, would be its transformation into an
                            independent political entity—a free, demilitarized city. Such a solution
                            would also take into account the wishes of the Western powers with
                            regard to freedom of access to West Berlin consonant with requisite
                            respect for the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            and guarantee to the population of this city the right to decide by
                            itself questions of its social-economic system, to retain that way of
                            life which it most prefers.</p>
                        <p>“Naturally, we proceed from the fact that in appropriate form those
                            positive results will be realized which were achieved by the previous
                            exchange of opinions by the parties on the questions of: finalizing and
                            strengthening of the existing German borders; guarantee of free access
                            to West Berlin; respect for the sovereignty of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>; precluding the armament of the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> with nuclear weapons; conclusion of a non-aggression
                            pact between <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw Treaty
                            organization.</p>
                        <p>“We hope that the resumption of the Soviet-American exchange of opinions
                            will be a step forward in the direction of a solution of the problem of
                            drawing a line under the Second World War, the fundamental improvement
                            of the situation in Europe and the consolidation of universal peace.</p>
                        <p>“An agreement on a German peace settlement and a normalization on this
                            basis of the situation in West Berlin would have great significance also
                            from the point of view of creating more favorable conditions <pb n="499"
                                xml:id="pg_499" facs="0521"/>for solving the problem of disarmament
                            and strengthening confidence between the USSR and the USA, as well as
                            among other states.</p>
                        <p>“We understand that, in such important international questions as the
                            question of a German peace settlement and normalization of the situation
                            in West Berlin, there are many aspects which have to be considered in
                            working out agreed decisions. But given the presence of good will and a
                            sincere desire for reaching agreement, without a doubt it would be
                            possible to overcome existing difficulties and to come to an agreement
                            which would take into account the interests of all parties.</p>
                        <p>“The Soviet Government anticipates that the results of the exchange of
                            opinions will be fruitful and, after they have been agreed upon by each
                            of the parties with its allies, arrangements can be made concerning the
                            manner and method for definitive formulation of agreement.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that, as far as we are concerned, we are prepared
                            to explore the present situation. Although Berlin is a subject which is
                            a vital matter to both sides, we thought it should not be allowed to
                            assume crisis proportions. Although there were some in the West who
                            questioned the value of these discussions, as far as the President was
                            concerned, we were willing to explore the subject further. It should be
                            no surprise that we do not accept the specific Soviet formula regarding
                            a peace settlement and the normalization of the Berlin situation on that
                            basis as an appropriate description for the exercise. We would describe
                            it in more general terms. We think there is a point in exploration, if
                            thereby the question can be reduced in size and importance. This does
                            not mean that the subject is less serious to us than before as a major
                            US responsibility. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> was familiar with the inherent difficulties in
                            the problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued by asking whether, in Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>’s judgment, there had not been
                            a reduction in the tensions surrounding Berlin during recent weeks and
                            months. There seemed to be somewhat less tension in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the relations between the Germans
                            themselves likewise seemed to be somewhat less tense. We were interested
                            in the agreement between the Federal Republic and Poland for the
                            establishment of trade offices as indicative of a reduction of tension
                            in the area. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            said he could accept this assessment but would not over-emphasize the
                            easing of the situation. Basically the situation was still an uneasy one
                            since it was unbalanced with the essential issues remaining unsolved. He
                            said he would like to explore with the US the Soviet proposals for the
                            replacement of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> flag in Berlin
                            by the flag of the United Nations. This exploration could take place in
                            a concrete way, on an item by item basis, either in connection with a
                            Soviet proposal or “in connection with your list.”</p>
                        <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0522"/>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> had any further idea with respect to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> involvement contemplated? Did he have any
                            further thoughts on this?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he was
                            prepared to discuss the question fully. How the Soviets felt about the
                            role of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops had been mentioned to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> on December 3,
                            1962 by Deputy Foreign Minister Semonev. What the Soviets propose is to
                            replace the troops presently in West Berlin with, say, a force made up
                            one half of troops of the three Western powers and the other half of
                            troops from other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> countries (perhaps
                            one or two neutral countries, one or two other <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> countries and one or two other Warsaw Pact countries).
                            These troops would stay there on the basis of a guarantee. But this
                            subject had never been discussed concretely. The Soviets had never
                            received a detailed reply on this issue. They wanted to start from the
                            point where the talks with the US had left off, that is to start with an
                            exploration of the last Soviet offer.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that this proposal was one of several which the
                            Soviets have made over a period of time. Thus, for example, they had
                            started with the idea of Western and Soviet troops in West Berlin, then
                            introduced the idea of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact
                            troops, and then the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had been brought
                            into the picture. The difficulty about these proposals, the Secretary
                            continued, is that they are unbalanced. They did not seem to show that
                            element of reciprocality which he had stressed before. A basic factor on
                            the German scene since the end of the war is that the Four Powers were
                            to hold Berlin in trust for the German people. It had been the capital
                            of Germany and in all likelihood would be again. The Four Powers were to
                            hold it for this purpose. To forget Berlin and to take only West Berlin
                            destroyed this basic idea. To dilute the Western forces worked against
                            the security of Berlin. When he had inquired, the Secretary noted, the
                            Soviets had made clear that they were referring only to West Berlin.
                            This was the reason why the discussions had not gone very far forward.
                            It is difficult to find a solution to the whole without thinking of the
                            parts, but it is also difficult to find a solution for the parts without
                            reference to the whole. The Soviets have left open the possibility of
                            the Germans coming together to discuss reunification. The Soviets have
                            suggested one procedure to achieve reunification, we another. In any
                            event Berlin belongs to the Germans. We have tried not to tear it out of
                            context. If there is to be a change, we have felt it should apply to
                            Berlin as a whole and an imbalance in proposals created a serious
                            problem for us.</p>
                        <p>We have not understood, the Secretary continued, what is “really in your
                            mind” on the point which the Soviets have made about the Western troops
                            in Berlin being <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> troops. In the
                            sense that the US is a member of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            they might be considered to be such. But the Berlin <pb n="501"
                                xml:id="pg_501" facs="0523"/>garrison has never been assigned to or
                            constituted a part of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces.
                            To think of West Berlin as a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base
                            is not realistic on either military or political grounds. If we were
                            looking for a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base, we wouldn’t
                            put it in West Berlin. We wondered if there were something here which we
                            had not fully understood. Why was this <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> aspect of such concern to the Soviets? The presence of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Warsaw Pact forces in the
                            Berlin area was, if anything, a stabilizing factor. The Secretary said
                            he did not think the Soviets wanted a situation where the Four Powers
                            did not share the responsibility for a final settlement in Germany. We
                            attached some importance to the Four Power responsibility as a
                            stabilizing element pending a final settlement of the German
                            question.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that we had not replied in detail with
                            respect to a particular <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> formula for
                            reasons which he had mentioned. Another way to test such a formula would
                            be to put oneself in the position of a West Berliner. What would he
                            think of it?</p>
                        <p>At one point, the Secretary continued, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> and he had been considering whether it would be
                            useful to talk further on the access problem and to see what might be
                            worked out on this subject. However, this broke down because it quickly
                            became a question of access to what. The Secretary said he did not know
                            if it would be useful to think of the access problem a bit. Today the
                            Ambassador and he were just exploring.</p>
                        <p>As an analogy, the Secretary observed, we thought it useful to complete
                            the nuclear test treaty even though we did not know the precise number
                            of inspections which could be agreed. An arrangement could be discussed
                            to protect our security interests as against Soviet interest in avoiding
                            espionage. We still thought it useful to complete the treaty text,
                            although there was still no agreement on the number of inspections. We
                            might likewise consider whether there was any point in talking about the
                            access problem. He did not, however, see quite how to take hold of this.
                            In the background there was always the problem of troops. The Soviets
                            have said that the presence of some Western troops is not an obstacle,
                            but the dilution of that presence, not on the basis of reciprocity and
                            for a limited time, makes this a real problem. The Soviets had proposed
                            a period of four years, for example. The Secretary said he did not know
                            a better way to undermine the confidence of the West Berlin population
                            than this.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he could
                            not accept what the Secretary had said about Four Power responsibility.
                            The fact is that West Germany, East Germany and West Berlin exist as
                            “separate states,” if one could use this term. After 17 years the
                            responsibility of the Four was not the same as in 1945. Their
                            responsibility then was to conclude a peace treaty with Germany. The
                            Soviets have nothing against reunification or against finding a formula
                            which would mention reunification. The Soviets <pb n="502"
                                xml:id="pg_502" facs="0524"/>would not oppose agreement between the
                            two Germanies on this subject.</p>
                        <p>As to access, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            continued, since the main point at issue was the troop question, that is
                            the question of access to whom, it would be easier to find a solution to
                            the access problem after the troop question was settled. The analogy
                            which the Secretary had drawn with the nuclear test discussions proved
                            just the opposite of what the Secretary had indicated. There was a need
                            to reach agreement on specific figures first, the nuclear test
                            discussions had shown. Therefore, the Soviets felt the troop question
                            was the most difficult and that the question was how to substitute the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> flag for the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> flag. The Soviets were prepared to
                            discuss this item by item. They were prepared to continue discussions to
                            find a way to an agreement. Their suggestion is that the two sides begin
                            with a more detailed discussion of the Soviet proposal, item by item.
                            Then they could take a look at the status of West Berlin and discuss
                            this item by item. The Soviets did not refuse to discuss the access
                            question but they thought that the two should begin with the most
                            difficult question: access to whose troops and the basis of a change
                            from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he considered the conversation today in the nature of
                            a preliminary exploratory talk. We had wanted to hear from Dobrynin the
                            basis on which Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> had raised the Berlin question with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>. We would expect to go
                            over these matters again. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> commented that the discussion was preliminary
                            to the preliminaries.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that he was not talking about delay as such but he
                            could remember saying to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            at one point that time has a way of taking care of some of these
                            questions. He was not sure that there were not developments in Central
                            Europe, to which the Soviets presumably agreed and to which we had no
                            objections, which tended to take some of the danger from the situation.
                            For example, there was the agreement between Poland and the Federal
                            Republic to exchange trade missions. A few years ago, the Poles seemed
                            to have more concern about the Federal Republic than today in the light
                            of their present willingness to establish relations of this kind. The
                            Secretary asked what elements <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> saw as imposing urgency in the present
                            situation. After all, there was nothing magical about 17 years.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the
                            recent agreement between Poland and the Federal Republic was perhaps a
                            hopeful but certainly an isolated sign. Such improved trade relations
                            were not tantamount to a real improvement in basic factors. Although he
                            did not want to raise this question now, he could only cite the famous
                            pipe example. Today the West Germans make an agreement with Poland;
                            tomorrow <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> might overturn
                            this agreement. There was no stability in the present <pb n="503"
                                xml:id="pg_503" facs="0525"/>situation. He could not agree that
                            everything was moving in one direction. Other developments were moving
                            in an unfavorable direction, for example with respect to
                            non-proliferation or the West German claim to have rights in West
                            Berlin. The question of a multilateral force was certainly not a hopeful
                            one. Delay could not be justified in the hope of improvement. The
                            situation might be even more complicated in a year or two. The Secretary
                            commented that he himself thought that the trend was not in an
                            unfavorable direction. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            cited the growing influence of the Federal Republic in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as another unfavorable trend. He went
                            on to say that the unsettled question of Berlin affected relations
                            between the US and Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Secretary’s query as to how he saw developments in
                            East Germany, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was more actively participating
                            in <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss>. It was joining other Eastern
                            European countries in increasing economic specialization.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what the Soviet Government had in mind when it talked
                            of a limited time for any arrangement on Berlin. What happened
                            thereafter? <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that
                            West Berlin would then become a free neutralized city with some <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence and certain guarantees given by
                            “your country and my country.” The Soviet Union was prepared to give
                            guarantees. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> headquarters could be
                            put near Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>’s office,
                            if this were desired. The limited time, therefore, referred to the
                            Western troop presence, the Secretary observed. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> noted that the time period was
                            to be four years in the Soviet proposal. The Soviets were prepared to
                            discuss all of this.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that perhaps we had better plan to sit down for a
                            systematic review of these points to see if there are any possibilities.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether the US
                            would prepare a list. The Secretary observed that, as <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had gathered, the question of
                            Western troop presence is a fundamental point for us. We were
                            responsible for the security of West Berlin. He wanted to mention again
                            the importance of reciprocity. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> suggested that they take item by item during
                            the next discussion. The Secretary assented and noted that our purpose
                            was to talk about anything reasonable. Both he and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> stressed that this did not
                            mean acceptance of the presence of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            flag in West Berlin for a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> flag
                            which was not there. The question of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            flag for the Warsaw Pact flag in East Berlin would also have to be
                            discussed.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> commented that
                            the Secretary knew the Soviet position with respect to East Berlin. It
                            was a part of East Germany both practically and juridically. On the
                            other hand, from the Western viewpoint, West Berlin had a special status
                            and was never part of the <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0526"
                            />Federal Republic. He was not instructed to discuss the situation in
                            East Berlin point by point. There was nothing new in this Soviet
                            position.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that this is where the point of reciprocity came
                            in. The Soviets did not want to discuss those subjects about which they
                            had tied a string. Yet they did not have any responsibilities in West
                            Berlin which we did not have in East Berlin. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> commented that the situation
                            was different. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                                >Thompson</persName> noted that the situation was different because
                            we had kept it different. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that East Berlin was part of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and the Secretary pointed out that it
                            was a part of the city of Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that the Soviet Union did not oppose the
                            unification of Berlin as a capital of a reunited Germany. The Soviets
                            had nothing against reunification, though it was difficult to discuss
                            practical points as to how it could be achieved.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that, in the next talk, each should review the
                            position from his point of view. Acceptance of such a review would not
                            mean acceptance in principle of the other’s position. They could spend
                            some time in a systematic review. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> suggested that, in order to begin with
                            something, they should start with the Soviet proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled that, from time to time, we had mentioned three
                            levels of discussion: a final settlement of the German question, a
                            factual solution and a modus vivendi. Did Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> see any remote possibility
                            that we could find a final solution to the German question, for example
                            along the lines of our 1959 proposals? Dobrynin said he did feel we
                            could reach some practical arrangement. The Secretary said both should
                            review the background of the talks and go over them systematically.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> agreed that, in response to press inquiries,
                            they would say merely that they had begun their exchange of views. If
                            queried as to whether any new proposals had been made, they would say
                            that this was just the beginning of talks and no papers had been
                            exchanged.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary then said that on Berlin there was very little new to
                            report. This did not surprise him since he had always thought that there
                            would be a solution to the Berlin problem only if we offered one in the
                            shape of concessions to the Soviet Union. If we did not do this, there
                            would be no solution. He thought the thing for us to do was merely to
                            hold fast to our present diplomatic and military positions.</p>
                        <p>Although the Soviets had initiated the talks, they did not seem too
                            interested in pressing them. He had seen Dobrynin a week ago,<note n="1"

                            who had nothing to offer beyond the repetition of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> suggestion which they had made months
                            before—even before the October crisis. This suggestion involved the
                            placing of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces in Berlin along with
                            the Western troops for four or five years, after which time the city
                            would become the free, neutralized city about which the Soviets had been
                            speaking. This, needless to say, was totally unacceptable to us—both the
                            U.S. and its allies. The Soviets claimed that there had been no reply to
                            this proposal. The Secretary said he would be seeing Dobrynin again
                            following his return to make our negative position absolutely clear. He
                            repeated that the Soviets did not seem to be pressing the Berlin
                            question although this could change overnight. However, there were no
                            external signs of Soviet anxiety on this question.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary began by referring to certain language with which
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had opened
                            their previous meeting,<note n="1" xml:id="d184fn1">See <ref
                                    target="#d182">Document 182</ref>.</note> specifically his
                            statement that “In the course of the earlier exchange of opinions the
                            parties succeeded in reaching definite results on well-known questions
                            in connection with a German peace settlement. There was also achieved
                            definite mutual understanding concerning the necessity for normalization
                            on this basis of the situation in West Berlin taking into account
                            actually existing conditions which came about on German territory as a
                            result of the past war.” This general language was a little hard to
                            read, the Secretary observed. He wanted to enter an early reservation so
                            that the Soviets would not think we had agreed to something to which we
                            had not agreed.</p>
                        <p>We would like to see the Berlin problem cleared up, the Secretary
                            continued. There was perhaps no other problem which was so disruptive of
                            relations between the two countries. In this connection the Secretary
                            referred to the continuous exchanges and the many incidents over Berlin.
                            As he had told <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>
                                recently,<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2">See <ref target="#d158"
                                    >Document 158</ref>.</note> he hoped the question could be
                            resolved by agreement and thus a crisis be avoided. This would be
                            possible if both sides would be willing to take account of the vital
                            interests of the other. As he had said before, the Secretary went on,
                            this taking into account of “actually existing conditions which came
                            about on German territory as a result of the past war” included our
                            position in Berlin. This also had to be taken into account.
                            Normalization does not apply <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0529"
                            />only to Berlin but also to the division of Germany which has existed
                            since the end of the war.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then referred to the remarks in <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>’s opening statement at their last meeting to
                            the effect that the Soviet Government proceeded “from the fact that in
                            appropriate form those positive results will be realized which were
                            achieved by the previous exchange of opinions by the parties on the
                            questions of: formalizing and strengthening of the existing German
                            borders; guarantee of free access to West Berlin; respect for the
                            sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>; precluding the
                            armament of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> with nuclear weapons; conclusion of a
                            non-aggression pact between the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            and the Warsaw Treaty organizations.” It was true, the Secretary said,
                            that, as indicated in the Statement of Principles which he had handed to
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in Geneva, we felt
                            that some real progress had been made on these points. But we did want
                            to note some possibility of misunderstanding. We want it to be
                            understood that these are subjects which would require discussion before
                            any agreement could be reached.</p>
                        <p>With reference to “respect for the sovereignty of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>”, the Secretary noted that he had
                            previously said that we did not see how a satisfactory arrangement on
                            access need interfere with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            sovereignty. The two could be mutually non-interfering in character.
                            Access to Berlin need not involve interference with or intrusion into
                            East German affairs. The Secretary said he had pointed out that many
                            States by agreeing to transit rights over them do so without interfering
                            with their sovereignty, for example in the case of aircraft overflights.
                            We would not want to leave the implication, however, that we are talking
                            about the political question of recognizing <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> sovereignty. We understand that there is such a place
                            as East Germany and we do not act as if we did not understand this. But
                            that is another matter.</p>
                        <p>At this point the Secretary began a lengthy discussion of nuclear
                            nonproliferation (covered in a separate memorandum of conversation).
                            During the course of this, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> came back to the Secretary’s remarks on his
                            Berlin statement made at the previous meeting.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d184fn3">A typed notation on the source text indicates that
                                the text of this paragraph from this point through the sentence
                                ending “would lead to formalizing” was classified Secret;
                                Noforn.</note> He said that he wanted to clarify the Soviet
                            reference to “positive results” point by point. As to borders, his
                            government proceeded from the assumption that there was a sort of
                            understanding between the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> and the President and <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on this subject. The Secretary
                            asked whether the Soviet language was intended to apply to the borders
                            of Germany as a whole. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            answered in the affirmative. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                                >Thompson</persName>’s remark that the word “formalizing” was broad
                            in its <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0530"/>meaning led to a brief
                            discussion whether this was the best translation from the Russian. The
                            Embassy had apparently translated the key word as “fixing” rather than
                            “formalizing”. In response to the Secretary’s query whether the Soviets
                            were also referring to the demarcation line between East and West
                            Germany, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the
                            Soviets were aware that the United States did not recognize the <gloss

                            He assumed that the Secretary did not wish to add anything new to what
                            he had discussed with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.
                            The Secretary said there was no change in the conversation from our side
                            but we did not want this to be understood as anything like formalizing
                            or that we considered it would lead to formalizing. The Secretary noted
                            that we had talked of a parallel arrangement. The three Western powers
                            would agree with the Soviet Union on access. The Soviets would speak to
                            the East Germans and this would take care of <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> sovereignty. This would be non-interference. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> commented that the Secretary
                            knew the Soviet position; it was not a question of formal
                            recognition.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that he had also said that, if the central
                            question of our vital interests were solved, he saw no difficulty in
                            these other questions falling into place. He wanted to point out that
                            various aspects of these matters were not agreed, though there had been
                            some progress or movement. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> commented that this is why the Soviets had used
                            the expression “positive results”. The Secretary noted that the Soviet
                            Ambassador in Paris had said that the Soviet Union and the United States
                            had reached agreement.<note n="4" xml:id="d184fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d168fn1">footnote 1, Document 168</ref>.</note> That
                            was why the Secretary felt that he had to say that we had not reached
                            agreement. Our Allies had come to us and said that we should show them
                            the agreement. We did not want any general formula to conceal a
                            misunderstanding as to what had actually been said on these various
                            points. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> agreed there had
                            been no formal agreement but merely what the Soviet language stated.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the first quotation from the Soviet statement which he had
                            noted, the Secretary pointed out that this was nothing but the same old
                            Soviet formula which turned up everywhere. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that the subject had been discussed many
                            months. The Secretary responded that no agreement had yet been found
                            that fitted this language. Dobrynin said that the language merely
                            described the situation. The Secretary observed that the Soviet
                            reference to “actually existing conditions” was undermined in the next
                            paragraph directed against the presence of foreign troops in West
                            Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> commented that
                            he did not see anything new here.</p>
                        <p>At this point the discussion of nuclear non-proliferation resumed.</p>
                        <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0531"/>
                        <p>Just before the end of the meeting, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> asked about future discussions on Berlin. How
                            did the Secretary feel about an exchange of views on the troop question
                            and related matters. The Secretary responded that these could be
                            discussed in the near future. On the troop issue, he might say that
                            difficult questions for us were involved in dealing with this issue
                            solely in terms of West Berlin, substituting a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> flag for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> flag,
                            diluting our forces in West Berlin, or the limited time period involved.
                            How could we consider that our vital interests were met thereby?
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> suggested that they
                            go through the subjects point by point and that the Secretary say what
                            was wrong with the Soviet proposals.</p>

                            request for Harriman’s “advice”, the Governor suggested that the USSR
                            come to an agreement on a nuclear test ban. This would enable them to
                            devote more of their resources to civilian production. He assured Mr.

                            wanted this very much.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> replied soberly
                            that the Soviets have been thinking about this for some time and they
                            want it too. He added that they are now preparing their position and the
                            President could expect an answer in the near future. He said, however,
                            that the Soviets attach greater importance to the German question,
                            although he was not saying these two subjects were linked.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d186fn1">In the telegraphic summary of this conversation a

                                US/Harriman)</note> Harriman asked what aspect of the German
                            situation: Berlin or an independent nuclear capability for the
                            Germans.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> said that the Soviets
                            want a normalization of Europe. The Americans should free themselves of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>’s influence. The
                            socialist countries have gained more in Berlin from the wall than they
                            would have gained by a peace treaty, which would have provided that no
                            wall could be built. “Berlin is no longer a source of any trouble.” He
                            said they raised the German question only because a settlement there
                            would contribute to the alleviation of tensions. The Soviets seek no
                            advantages in that country. If there were a German peace treaty nothing
                            would change; the only result would be that the current situation
                            involving two Germanies would be legitimized.</p>

                        <p>Harriman said that since the Soviets were satisfied with the current
                            situation in Berlin, why do they not wish to get on with other important
                            things such as a test ban agreement? <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> replied: “We’ll sign one right away, but,

                            which concerned him and, he assumed, was of concern to Chairman

                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had expressed his worry
                            about the Germans. Why hadn’t he said anything about the Chinese and the
                            possibility that they may have nuclear weapons in the near future.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> suggested Harriman
                            take that up with the Chinese. The Soviets and the United States could
                            talk about Germany because we were mutual victors in the war against
                            Germany, but China was one of the Soviet’s allies and Harriman should
                            treat them as equals. Harriman said he had personally wanted to go to
                            talk with the Chinese a few years ago but that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> would not cooperate. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> replied that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> was not the Foreign Minister of
                            China and could not get Harriman into China.</p>
                        <p>In response to Governor Harriman’s invitation to luncheon the Chairman
                            regretted that he would be especially busy for the next two days and
                            would not have time. He stressed that he and his colleagues regard Mr.
                                <persName>Harriman</persName> with the highest esteem and would like
                            to return our relations to the state they were in during the period when
                            Mr. <persName>Harriman</persName> was Ambassador. He proposed: “I will
                            give my word that I will find a basis for a test ban agreeable to both
                            sides provided you agree to work out the basis of a German settlement
                            which would recognize the two Germanies as they now exist”.</p>
                        <p>Harriman replied he could not buy a “pig-in-a-poke”. The United States is
                            always ready to talk about both the test ban and about the German
                            settlement. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> remarked
                            with a smile that Harriman was an old diplomat who knew how to talk
                            without saying anything. He asked the Governor to convey his best wishes
                            to the President and his family, and to tell the President that he
                            wanted to continue to cooperate with the United States in finding
                            reasonable language and in the search for a solution to all the world’s
                            problems. In closing, he also asked the Governor to convey his best
                            regards to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Governor Harriman thanked the Chairman for these words and said he would
                            convey them to the President and the Secretary.</p>

                        <p>In a letter to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                            on April 29, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            reviewed the state of U.S.-Soviet relations. In a paragraph near the end
                            of the letter he wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I agree with you that we have before us also other questions and
                                    problems aside from those mentioned in your message. In the
                                    first instance I would mention the conclusion of a German peace
                                    treaty and normalization of the situation in West Berlin on that
                                    basis. The solution of this problem, and given mutual desire
                                    that is not now such a difficult matter, would undoubtedly bear
                                    the greatest returns both from the standpoint of the interest of
                                    consolidating peace and for a serious improvement in
                                    Soviet-American relations. As long as the remnants of the Second
                                    World War, which constantly make themselves known, continue to
                                    exist, then both you and we will be forced to devote ever
                                    greater funds to armaments, that is to increasing our ability to
                                    destroy each other. And understandably in such a situation it is
                                    difficult to count on agreement on disarmament, which requires
                                    above all faith and still more faith for its attainment.
                                    Therefore, if one realistically evaluates the situation, one
                                    cannot but come to the conclusion that the conclusion of a
                                    German peace treaty would create better conditions also for the
                                    resolution of the question of questions of the modern
                                    day—universal and complete disarmament.” (Department of State,

                                Berlin. (Ibid., Rusk Files: Lot 72 D 192, Chron) At a private dinner
                                on May 17 <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had asked

                            idea that this is a crucial time of policy re-examination in Moscow,
                            during which it is exceedingly important to find some point on which the
                            Soviets can reach some agreement with the West. The discussion covered
                            nuclear testing, nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, Laos, Cuba, and a
                            glancing reference to Berlin. For some strange reason, even though the
                            Soviets asked for the talks on Berlin, they are not pressing them.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> even said that
                            US–USSR agreement on civil air transportation would be psychologically

                            but it would do no harm and would show some people in Moscow that
                            East-West agreement on something was possible. He indicated more than
                            once that the <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> form was not

                            The Secretary had replied that while this was not an easy problem, he
                            did not think the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations were
                            completely negative on this matter. However, all of them had bad

                                >NATO</gloss> agreed to an <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss>, and
                            a Berlin crisis broke out subsequently, <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> would look extremely foolish. The complete lack of
                            progress on substantive issues outstanding between the Soviets and the
                            West makes an <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> hardly worth while.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> responded that he
                            could understand this, but an agreement—even though of no practical
                            significance—would greatly diminish the prospect of a Berlin crisis. He
                            did not seem particularly interested in the Berlin talks as such but
                            emphasized the importance of reaching agreement on any point—especially
                            an <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary told the Foreign Ministers that it might be worth while
                            looking at this matter against the background of what seems to be going
                            on in Moscow. It appears that the Soviets are going through a period of
                            reappraisal. They have suffered serious political losses in expensive
                            areas such as Iraq and Indonesia, and it is possible that a dangerous
                            situation may develop. The time between now and July, when the talks
                            with the Chinese begin, is very important, and it would be worth our
                            while to spend some time examining what is going on in the Kremlin.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> agreed that there was
                            a thorough re-examination going on in Moscow. He recalled that <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had seemed interested last fall
                            when the Foreign Secretary had mentioned the possibility of an <gloss
                                target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss>. One could not tell, however, whether
                            anything sufficiently worth while could be developed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that as he recalled the <gloss target="#t_NAP1"
                                >NAP</gloss> draft the Soviets presented in Geneva,<note n="2"

                            country. He supposed, however, that ratification could be avoided by
                            letters from the respective Secretaries General denouncing aggression
                            and calling for the settlement of all disputes by peaceful means. It is
                            just possible that this would be of interest to the Soviets. The US
                            Government has reached no conclusions. We have been skeptical since
                            1945. However, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> left the
                            impression that this might be a good time for the Soviets to have
                            something to point to in the way of an agreement with the West which
                            would be of psychological, rather than practical, importance. <pb
                                n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0537"/>We have, of course, during the
                            last two years of talks on Berlin thought of an <gloss target="#t_NAP1"
                                >NAP</gloss> as the end of the trail rather than the beginning.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> remarked that as the
                            Soviets don’t seem particularly interested in discussing Berlin, this
                            problem is more or less liquidated.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> asked whether an
                                <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> wouldn’t make it easier for the
                            Soviets to leave Berlin alone.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Couve</hi> commented that an <gloss target="#t_NAP1"
                                >NAP</gloss> might very well lead to recognition of the East German
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> seemed to be saying that nonrecognition would
                            not be an obstacle. At this point the Secretary read some excerpts from
                            the <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> text the Soviets submitted in
                            Geneva on February 20, 1963, and circulated a copy. He remarked that the
                            formalities could be discounted. An <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss>
                            might be in the form of simultaneous declarations from each side with no
                            direct connection.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said he felt the Soviets
                            were seeking something which would to some extent cement the status quo.
                            Even without a peace treaty and recognition of the East German regime,
                            an <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> would go far toward stabilizing
                            the status quo. An <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> is very important
                            to the Soviets as proven by their bringing it into the Geneva
                            discussions. Such a pact should be the end of a chain of events, not the
                            beginning. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>,
                            incidentally, thinks he invented the <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss>
                            in Geneva in 1955 and therefore has a special interest in it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> asked what sort of
                            declarations of nonaggressive intent could be made by <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> which would go further than what has
                            already been done.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary read the operative portions of the Soviet <gloss
                                target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> draft of February 20 as a possible
                            example.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> remarked that for the
                            first time this would get the basic conflict out of a Four Power context
                            into somewhat of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> context.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary interjected at this point that he was this evening engaging
                            in a discussion with colleagues and not in an official expression of US
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>He added that during the last six months there had been a number of
                            encouraging significant developments among the satellites, e.g. Poland,
                            Hungary, Bulgaria, and Rumania.</p>
                        <p>He would speculate that the Communist system has an inevitable great
                            crisis to face when it must choose between pressing, or abandoning,
                            world revolution. In October <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> removed his missiles from Cuba on the pretext
                            that he had obtained from us a guarantee that we would not invade Cuba,
                            which we had no intention of doing anyway. He might be grasping at
                            fairly slender straws.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said an <gloss
                                target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> might be useful to the Soviets even
                            though appearing insignificant. It would be a very important move and
                            would be <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0538"/>considered by many as
                            the beginning of a détente. This did not mean that it was inappropriate.
                            It might even be appropriate.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the recognition problem could be forgotten for the
                            moment. We had previously rejected an <gloss target="#t_NAP1"
                                >NAP</gloss> to avoid putting <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            and the Warsaw Pact on an equal footing. Pressing the status quo could
                            be a serious matter if it implied acceptance of the division of Germany.
                            However, we should give the <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> a fresh
                            look against the background of Moscow’s problems.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> commented that one
                            problem would obviously be to avoid recognition of East Germany, but he
                            did not see how one could bring about a détente with the Soviets—if the
                            Russians want one—without giving serious consideration to something like
                            an <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> remarked that a few years
                            ago he, himself, supported ideas like an <gloss target="#t_NAP1"
                                >NAP</gloss>. He had felt that if it were important to the Soviets
                            and unimportant to the West, it should be undertaken. But today the
                            situation is different. An <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> would now
                            seem like the end of an epoch. The psychological effect would be that
                            concepts such as self-determination and reunification would appear to be
                            buried. It would be better to continue the relative tension that exists
                            today rather than pay the price for a détente which would be no real
                            détente because no problem would have been solved.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked about the current <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> consideration of a possible <gloss target="#t_NAP1"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said consideration of a

                            interrupted by the current meeting in Ottawa but would soon be

                        <p>The Secretary said it might be well for the Ambassadorial Group to study
                            this problem before <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> froze it one
                            way or the other. He was not prepared to give a firm view of the US
                            Government, which has been very skeptical about an <gloss
                                target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss>, but in view of <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>’s remarks and what is probably
                            going on in Moscow, we should not fail to examine the problem.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> asked if <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had given the impression that

                        <p>The Secretary said the Ambassador had not put it that way but had said it
                            would make a Berlin crisis far less likely. We can’t simply brush this
                            aside.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> asked how contact
                            would be maintained with the Soviets on this subject.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said either side could make the next move. No specific
                            arrangement was made to pursue this topic. It is likely that the Soviets
                                <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0539"/>will revert to this before

                            ready with an answer.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said the real issue was
                            what was in the best interests of the West—not of the USSR. The two are
                            not necessarily identical.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the Ambassadorial Group should be asked to pull
                            together as much information as possible concerning what is going on in
                            the Bloc with the changes in military command, the Kozlov illness, the
                            Rumanian refusal to accept its assigned role in the economic plans, etc.
                            We don’t have a really good idea of what has happened since October
                            22.</p>
                        <p>Krapf asked if an <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> was the cheapest
                            concession that could be made to the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had
                            mentioned the civil air agreement, which seems to be of some importance
                            to the Soviets, although <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> is not particularly interested. They have
                            made some gestures concerning outer space, and have even hinted that
                            maybe the US and the USSR should combine their efforts to put men on the
                            moon.</p>
                        <p>They do not seem, he continued, to be really interested in talking about
                            Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> has offered
                            nothing new in the two talks that have taken place in the current

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said it is certainly not in

                            possibility for one.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked about the current status of the <gloss

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said first he would like
                            to point out that the Soviets’ concept of a détente was to obtain
                            acceptance of a situation they have created.</p>
                        <p>As to the <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> talks, no progress has been
                            made because the East Germans have refused to discuss all political
                            concessions.</p>
                        <p>Some progress has been made with Poland, Hungary, and Rumania, but the
                            Soviets permit this because it helps the economic development of these
                            countries and lightens the burden on the Soviet Union. The West Germans
                            are anxious to keep these Eastern European contacts open. The two most
                            difficult problems are the inclusion of Berlin in agreements with
                            Eastern European countries and the problem of diplomatic relations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> suggested that this
                            might be discussed in the Ambassadorial Group.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> added that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> is realizing that the Bloc
                            countries, and even the Soviet Zone of Germany, are becoming
                            increasingly difficult to control.</p>
                        <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0540"/>
                        <p>The Secretary reiterated the need for a fundamental reassessment, under
                            the guidance of the Ambassadorial Group, of our intelligence on the
                            Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> stressed the importance
                            of contingency planning—keeping it up to date and carrying it forward
                            especially in: 1) the protection of civilian traffic; 2) passports and
                            visas; and 3) economic countermeasures.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> returned to the <gloss
                                target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> saying that since the Russians might
                            want a reply by July, it would be well to be armed with parallel
                            declarations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that the Ambassadorial Group examine alternate
                            forms for an <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> reminded the Ministers that
                            the <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> was still being discussed in
                            Paris and Geneva. It will be difficult, he added, to continue to refuse

                                >ENDC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed that the whole <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss>
                            subject, including the Geneva and Paris aspects, should be studied

                            USA to Europe, including West Berlin, scheduled for June, Chancellor
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> has declared that he,
                            as head of government of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, together
                            with other West German leaders, intends to accompany President <persName

                            Berlin. According to available information, <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> intends to meet President in West Berlin and
                            remain there during his visit.</p>
                        <p>It is as yet difficult for us to judge whether these plans of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> are supported by White House.
                            It is however completely obvious that <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519"
                                facs="0541"/>these plans of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                            Chancellor bear an openly provocative character. They are clearly
                            directed toward aggravating situation and creating additional
                            difficulties for resolution of important international question, on
                            which Soviet-American exchange of views has now been resumed. Moreover,
                            everyone knows—and this has repeatedly been confirmed by USA—that West
                            Berlin is not part of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. End text.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> I should report this
                            to my government and give him official reply upon its instructions. On
                            basis my familiarity with question, however, I wished point out that
                            much of US-Soviet discussion Berlin had centered precisely around
                            question free movement persons between West Germany and West Berlin. I
                            could see nothing in such movements that could be described as
                            “provocative”. There had been many meetings in East Berlin at which
                            Soviet leaders had been present together with <persName corresp="#p_UW1"
                                >Ulbricht</persName>. Both of us had the same responsibilities in
                            this matter for all of Berlin. I therefore could not see how
                            Chancellor’s travel to West Berlin could be called “provocative”. Nor
                            did I see how it could be regarded as prejudicial to US-Soviet
                            talks.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> said: First, this was not a
                            question of simple movement of persons. <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> was not just West German citizen with ordinary
                            passport, but head of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Government,
                            which had nothing to do with West Berlin. Consequently, these two
                            aspects of matter could not be put on same plane. Second, it was
                            altogether different situation when <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> was there with <persName corresp="#p_UW1"
                                >Ulbricht</persName>. East Berlin is part, and capital, of <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and no one had ever disputed this. On
                            other hand, West Berlin not part of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>;
                            even US admits that. Consequently, these two things can’t be put on same
                            plane: It was not unlawful for <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> to be in East Berlin, whereas <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> had nothing to do with West
                            Berlin. Thirdly, I had said there was nothing provocative in this, but
                            Soviets considered this kind of step as not directed toward facilitating
                            US-Soviet talks, but rather toward hindering them. Our points of view on
                            this are different, but first two points he had put were purely factual
                            ones.</p>
                        <p>I responded by agreeing there was difference between situations in East
                            and West Berlin, but this was because Soviet action had made them
                            different. However, I did not propose that he and I should take over
                            discussions of Germany and Berlin already started by Secretary and
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. I should bring his
                            representation to attention of my government and report his additional
                            remarks.</p>
                        <p>Comment: Perhaps emboldened by reports of Franco-British-US attitude
                            toward Bundestag meeting in Berlin, Soviets appear intent on trying a

                            forty-five minute meeting today, I made oral statement to <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> as per <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1"
                                >reftel</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Replying, <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> referred to first
                            part my statement (expressing <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>’s
                            surprise at Sov representation) and said US did not answer May 22
                            statement and apparently did not wish to answer it. US did not wish to
                            admit that <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> presence West
                            Berlin while President there could not be viewed as factor contributing
                            to Sov-US exchange of views and to lessening of international tension,
                            both between US and USSR and with regard to situation in Europe. He said
                            he could not view our “surprise” as justified. When <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> decided to visit West Berlin
                            during President’s visit there, he understood full well this would serve
                            to sharpen tensions between US and USSR. If US finds Sov statement
                            surprising, this means US doesn’t recognize importance of such step. He
                            could therefore only regret that statement had not been accepted and
                            express Soviet concern on that account.</p>
                        <p>With regard portion of statement setting record straight on East Berlin,
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> said this did not
                            relate to his oral statement, but to comment he had made on my
                            commentary on statement. He did not want to polemicize about it, but
                            could only conclude from it that we agreed with what he had said about
                            West Berlin’s not being part of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                            since we did not dispute that part of his statement. In that case, what
                            business did Chancellor of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> have
                            there, what connection was there between his visit and that of
                            President? This confirmed that his statement had been well-founded.</p>
                        <p>So far as what I had said about East Berlin was concerned, <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> said he could not agree. US and
                            its closest allies might think this, but whole rest of world regarded
                            East Berlin as capital <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, since
                            government of that country is located there. But this point was in
                            dispute and we could not settle it here.</p>
                        <p>I said I agreed that it was first part of our statement which responded
                            to theirs, but that my government had wanted to set the record straight
                            with the second part so as not to leave him under any impression that we
                            agreed with his remark on status of East Berlin.</p>
                        <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0544"/>
                        <p>I said I wished, too, to straighten out any inference he appeared to be
                            drawing in his statement, and still seemed to be drawing, that there
                            might be different points of view between <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> trip. Such implications had
                            been made in Sov press, as well, most recently in Izvestiya May 25
                            article by <persName>M. Mikhailov</persName>. I then read him brief
                            statement from May 9 Wireless Bulletin to effect President always
                            assumed Chancellor would be with him in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>I said I might comment a little further on his statement that West Berlin
                            is not part of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. This point had in a
                            sense been answered by second part of my statement. Fact is that, by
                            Four-Power agreement, all of us had agreed that all of Berlin should
                            have Four-Power status. Within limits of possibilities, <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had remained faithful to that
                            agreement, while USSR had made East Berlin a separate part. In these
                            circumstances, closest possible ties and working conditions had
                            developed between West Berlin and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.
                            Not whole rest of world, but USSR and its close friends, may believe
                            East Berlin is part of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. This is,
                            however, one of important points at issue between us.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> broke in here to ask if I
                            were saying West Berlin was part of <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                            >FRG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I said I was not, but was saying all of us had agreed Berlin should be
                            kept together as the capital of a future reunited Germany.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> said it had not been they,
                            but the US, which first created a self-sufficient West Berlin. Not the
                            USSR, but the US, had created the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                            before the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> had been created. Not the
                            USSR, but the [omission—US?], had first violated the Four-Power status
                            of Berlin. Four-Power agreements on Berlin had no juridical force today
                            and this was result solely of unilateral Western actions. It was not to
                            advantage of US to look for the guilty ones, since historical facts were
                            not on side of US. He could therefore confirm from second part of my
                            statement that US does not consider West Berlin a part of <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Thus, burden of his May 22 statement
                            remains justified. Why should Chancellor Adanauer be in West Berlin
                            together with President? This decision had been dictated by political
                            considerations and was not directed toward reducing tensions, but only
                            towards aggravating them. That had been whole point of their statement:
                            To warn US about political consequences of this step.</p>
                        <p>I said I must take issue with a couple of his remarks, since we differed
                            on some of facts involved. Fact is that Sov side had walked out of
                            Berlin Kommandatura in 1948 and had instituted blockade. Allied
                            Kommandatura, now continuing as tripartite organ, had suspended
                            provision of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Constitution making
                            Berlin Land of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>But West Berlin must live and, with Allied sanction, has developed close
                            political, economic, financial, and cultural ties with <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Even Chairman <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> has publicly recognized West
                            Berlin and West <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0545"/>Germany have
                            same political system. We think it quite natural Chancellor should be in
                            West Berlin when President is there.</p>
                        <p>I said I trusted I had not heard correctly about our agreements on West
                            Berlin. I assumed Bolz-<persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>
                            agreement, with which he was certainly familiar, was still in force.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> said it was clear he could
                            argue endlessly with me on subject. I agreed and repeated we did not
                            want to assume work of Secretary and Amb <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> said I had forgotten about
                            separate currency reform in West Berlin, which had been put through long
                            before blockade. It was that which had led to division of Berlin and
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>I said we differed on history, but I hoped he would consider seriously
                            our position that we could see nothing provocative or
                            tension-heightening in Chancellor’s accompanying President to West
                            Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Rising, <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> said they could not
                            agree with us on this and must maintain the view expressed in the May 22
                            statement.</p>
                        <p>Comment: <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> nodded to my
                            statement about Bolz-<persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>
                            agreement but did not specifically comment. By his reasoning, appears we
                            can take his failure to respond as agreement that it remains in
                            force.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said a point which
                            Germans took very much to heart was how problem of German reunification
                            should be set forth publicly. Germans had noted that in recent US
                            statements there were more references to Berlin and Berlin access than
                            to reunification. For US, <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> said, Berlin has significance only in context
                            of a policy aiming at German reunification. He was aware this presented
                            practical difficulties to us in our relations with Soviets but thought
                            we could express the matter in a more positive way. Could we not try
                            convince Soviets that exercise of right of self-determination by Germans
                            was in Soviets’ own interest and need not have any unilateral adverse
                            effect. Emphasis should be that to permit self-determination to Germans
                            would help bring about safer and more secure situation for Soviets in
                            Europe. Should we however continue to talk only about West Berlin and
                            our rights there, this helped maintain atmosphere of tension.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said he glad have these comments. He wished to stress there
                            should be no question of strength our feelings about German
                            reunification in light our attitude about self-determination for peoples
                            everywhere, including at home. He had spoken to Sovs, particularly
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, on many occasions in
                            these terms. He was himself convinced we could not have peace in Europe
                            in absence of self-determination, which included German reunification.
                            But then it was always necessary to face up to next question: what are
                            you going to do about it?</p>

                        <p>After noting that we had not come to any final decisions on the
                            Waltersdorfer Chaussee crossing point, the Secretary said he would like
                            to talk the matter out with <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> and hear his views.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said that he would have
                            serious doubts about closing the crossing point even though it works
                            exclusively in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> interest. The
                            whole set of crossing arrangements worked similarly, i.e. the limited
                            crossing points and the distinctions between West Berlin and West German
                            access to the Soviet Sector. The Vienna-Schoenefeld deal might <pb
                                n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0553"/>soon collapse, and crossings
                            would be limited to a very few Bloc travellers. The Western position was
                            “anti-Wall,” and any deviation from this would weaken our case in the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>As to the Schoenefeld flights, the Austrians were trying to get
                            permission for overflights over the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            for Austrian Airlines (<gloss target="#t_AUA1">AUA</gloss>) to land at
                            Tempelhof. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> thought this
                            was a good idea from the local standpoint, since it would give cheaper
                            and faster service to Vienna. If <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            permission was withheld, he thought that Vienna would cancel the
                            Schoenefeld service on July 31. <gloss target="#t_AUA1">AUA</gloss>
                            would, of course, have to get Allied permission for West Berlin
                            landings, and he hoped the Allies would ask for Senat views.</p>
                        <p>He realized there was a feeling on the Allied side that air service
                            outside the corridors might weaken the Allied legal position. He saw
                            this point but was not convinced. There are now other non-Allied
                            non-Communist access routes. He mentioned the several roads used for
                            West German access, and the Swedish train to Stockholm. It was
                            absolutely clear if the Allies had to decide negatively in view of the
                            corridor problem, that the Senat would have to respect this.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we were not at that point yet. We were soliciting his
                            views. Returning to the gate, had there been any contacts with the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as to whether West Berliners
                            could use it? <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> replied
                            negatively. The Secretary said we were in favor of practical
                            arrangements to ease life, and were confident of the superior attractive
                            force of West Berlin and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. But
                            practical steps can create new problems. What is the popular opinion on
                            this? Does it accuse the Allies of tolerating a unilateral action?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> admitted there was strong
                            feeling against the crossing point last week. But he had discussed the
                            question with 20–25 senior Senat officials of the <gloss
                                target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> on June 22. All were against closing
                            the crossing, and the most radical views were only to support a popular
                            boycott. West Berlin had never resorted to police measures. Actually a
                            boycott already existed. The second flight of the Vienna service flew
                            out empty on June 22.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked, not as a suggestion, but as a possible contingency,
                            that if the West Berlin authorities asked us not to close the point,
                            whether they would take the responsibility for public opinion. The
                            confidence of the population was important for the security of Berlin.
                            If confidence goes, security melts out from under us.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> replied that no discussion
                            would be at the expense of the Allies. There were a lot of young people
                            who were irritated. The Senat knows how to convince them what to do from
                            past experience. “We would not evade responsibility.”</p>
                        <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0554"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said he understood that <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName>’s policy was to punch holes in the Wall even with
                            no advantage to his side.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said his policy had never
                            been to keep people from leaving West Berlin, and this was a sound
                            principle for the future.</p>
                        <p>When the Secretary asked whether the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            did not arrest people on the Swedish train, <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> said “No.” There might be a few instances, but
                            the passengers had a visa-like “piece of paper,” which implied special
                            permission.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there was a great deal of theology about Berlin, and
                            it was often hard to learn the practical effects of policy. Popular
                            opinion was a not unimportant part of the problem.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said it was an element.
                            Some West Berliners resented use of Communist facilities, i.e. for
                            travel to Bulgaria, in order to meet East German relatives there. Only
                            wealthier people could afford this. Still the workers accepted it.
                                (<persName corresp="#p_SK4">Schuetz</persName> interjected that
                            newspapers were not the same as Berliners.) <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> continued that Berlin could not become a ghetto
                            and ignore the principle of free movement.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> asked whether
                            there was no leverage to influence the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> on the crossing point.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said “no,” but he was not
                            sure. <persName corresp="#p_SK4">Schuetz</persName> said the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> thought so, through <gloss
                                target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_LK2"
                                >Leopold</persName> considered that <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> had traffic processing troubles which might create an
                            interest in making interzonal traffic easier.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that there were several problems about the Austrian
                            flights. Air access was of special sensitivity and was the critical
                            element of our access. If part of air access were dependent on the
                            agreement of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and this dependence
                            grew in amount, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would say that
                            we accept access with agreement of the Zone; the occupation was
                            therefore over, and there was no need for Allied access.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> professed to see the
                            point, but doubted if this danger could arise from the Austrian
                            service.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said one service could grow to many, e.g. with Switzerland
                            and Scandinavia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said that SAS overflew the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> from Prague, reportedly without
                            any government agreement. This involved <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Allies. The Austrians thought they could also work out
                            something without government agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary feared this might be a nibbling away at recognition of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> noted
                            that our air access was virginal, pure and undiluted. The <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> had nothing to do with it. If the
                                <gloss target="#t_AUA1">AUA</gloss> overflew the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> air control system would govern the flights, <pb
                                n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0555"/>and this would engender some
                            measure of relations between <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss> and
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Corridor flights would no
                            longer be autonomous.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName> explained
                            that the Soviets were only notified of Allied flight plans; they did not
                            otherwise participate in traffic control. <gloss target="#t_AUA1"
                                >AUA</gloss> or other non-corridor flights to West Berlin would in
                            effect be guided into Tempelhof by the Schoenefeld control tower, and
                            this would present infinite possibilities for disruption of our air
                            traffic.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SK4">Schuetz</persName> asked if they did not now
                            schedule flights which required adjustment of Western flight plans.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName> replied
                            negatively. They had tried to do something analogous in the February
                            1962 crisis.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the Soviets had pushed hard to connect
                            sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to access. We
                            have resisted and told them to make their own arrangements, since we
                            will not submit our access to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.
                            This would open us up to suffocation by <persName corresp="#p_UW1"
                                >Ulbricht</persName>. We are concerned about <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> consent for entry into West Berlin. This moves down a
                            trail leading towards great problems, unless the East Germans have
                            goodwill or the West Germans have an effective means to regulate such
                            matters with them. We don’t want to rely upon the East Germans and we
                            don’t want to lose the speciality of our air access. The case of the
                            Swedish train is different.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said that everyone knew
                            that he wanted no weakening of the status of Western access. The
                            question is whether additions would weaken it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that following this line of argument, he could imagine
                            a situation in which several airlines flew to Tempelhof or Schoenefeld.
                            If the subject were later to come to the U.N., the Soviets could make an
                            argument that there already existed full and sufficient non-Allied
                            access to Berlin, and that they wanted only to block U.S. military
                            access. We could hardly get a majority on such an issue if we had
                            participated in building up the alternatives.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> argued that Sweden,
                            Switzerland and Austria do not offer major routes. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SK4">Schuetz</persName> added that Tempelhof could
                            regulate which aircraft could land that the other side could not.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether technical arrangements could not be made to
                            transfer the tower control from Schoenefeld to Tempelhof 50 miles out of
                            Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName> observed
                            that this was possible, but it was difficult to see how it could happen,
                            since the aim of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> policy in this area
                            was to attack the validity of the Tempelhof <gloss target="#t_ATC1"
                                >ATC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if it were true that <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> wanted to multiply means of access. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said this was the case. The
                            fare to Vienna would cost <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 80 less and
                            take a shorter time, and we should examine the possibilities <pb n="534"
                                xml:id="pg_534" facs="0556"/>from a practical viewpoint. The
                            Austrian Consul General had asked him whether he could discuss the
                            matter with <gloss target="#t_AUA1">AUA</gloss>, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> had inquired whether there was
                            any chance of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> agreeing to <gloss
                                target="#t_AUA1">AUA</gloss> overflights to West Berlin. The
                            Austrian Consul General said he has asked the same question of Vienna,
                            and on June 22 had received the answer that there were “substantial
                            chances,” given the support of the Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> personally had the feeling that the Austrians
                            think that they don’t stand a chance. However, even if the project does
                            not lead to results, all of us should discuss the general problem since
                            it might come up again. If there were an eventual possibility to get an
                            interim agreement with the Soviets which would include new elements,
                            would it not perhaps be necessary to add additional elements of
                            access?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that this was a long-term problem. We welcomed
                            possibilities of West and East Berlin working out reciprocal advantages
                            by punching holes in the Wall, and we welcomed <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> trade and contacts. These aspects did not present any
                            problems. What bothers us is to bring access into a position where it is
                            subject to the agreement of the East Germans. He said frankly that we
                            could make a deal with the Soviets tomorrow if we were willing to
                            concede this point.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said that he agreed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that there are changes under way in the Bloc and
                            rumors of differing attitudes. It was too early to see where these would
                            lead. As late as last October, the U.S. was exposed to the most colossal
                            deceit on the part of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            personally. We had no illusions that they would cut our throats if they
                            could. We feel that the security of West Berlin fundamentally depends on
                            the U.S. presence in West Berlin which is based on the right of victory,
                            not on agreement. We won’t be pushed out or negotiated out. This is
                            utterly fundamental. Some day the situation may change and other
                            considerations might govern, but our primordial principle is that we are
                            there by right and not by the consent of anybody. Of course we might
                            consider leaving if we heard the West Berliners shouting “Yanks go
                            home.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary summarized by saying that we will be in consultation with
                            the Federal Government and with West Berlin on the gate problem, since
                            this is a matter in which they have an interest. We want to talk with
                            the French and the British and will gladly say that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>’s views and those of the
                            Federal Republic should fully be taken into account. The Secretary
                            personally thought it was a good idea to punch holes.</p>
                        <p>Air services other than through the corridors was another question. The
                            Secretary characterized this as a more difficult problem and much more
                            serious. We would talk about it with <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> later. Perhaps the problem arose because the
                            Austrian Commerce Ministry acted without consultation of the Foreign
                            Office. The international ramifications were <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535"
                                facs="0557"/>very considerable and he was not sure that the
                            Austrians appreciated them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> promised to prepare a
                            memorandum on what the Austrians had told him, which he hoped to finish
                            the next day.<note n="1" xml:id="d197fn1">Following this conversation

                        <p>On June 26 President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> flew
                            from Wiesbaden Air Force Base to Berlin, arriving at Tegel Airport at
                            9:45 a.m. After arrival remarks at Tegel the President traveled by
                            motorcade to the Congress Hall where he addressed the German National
                            Congress of the Industrial Trade Union of Construction Workers. The
                            Presidential party then stopped at the wall and at Checkpoint Charlie,
                            before arriving at City Hall to sign the Golden Book and address an
                            enormous crowd that had gathered in the Rudolph Wilde Platz. After lunch
                            he made an address at the Free University of Berlin and then, at 5:15
                            p.m., left Berlin for Ireland. For texts of the remarks and addresses

                        <p>Conveying accurate first-blush reaction is problem in proper choice of
                            superlatives. The tumultuous reception accorded President was clearly
                            unprecedented and at times overwhelming. The record crowd of
                            approximately 1.5 million lining entire 35-mile route and massed before
                            City Hall had been anticipated. In the event, however, the emotional
                            quality of that great crowd, its enthusiastic friendliness and
                            openhearted spirit was an unpredictably moving experience. To us it
                            seemed that the Berliner wished to express at one time his high regard
                            for, and trust in the President, his open gratitude for US support past
                            and present, his commitment to the West in the face of Communist
                            pressures and his proud confidence in himself and the future. By so
                            doing in company of bulk of his fellow citizens, the Berliner may well
                            have deepened that trust, gratitude, commitment and confidence. As one
                            editorial commented: Any remaining reserve in German-American relations
                            is dissipated and whatever threats <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> may bring can now be met with confidence.</p>
                        <p>Berliners clearly were enraptured by the President—perhaps as much by the
                            human warmth, personal involvement and evident modesty frequently cited
                            in today’s press, as by his generous words of praise and encouragement
                            to them. Not overlooked, however, even in the first reaction were the
                            President’s sober messages concerning the indivisibility of freedom and
                            the heavy demands which it places upon us all. We expect those messages
                            will be taken up by a broad range of leadership groups here after the
                            emotional after-glow of the visit subsides. This process began even
                            today with a thoughtful editorial in the independent newspaper
                            Tagesspiegel interpreting the President’s university speech as a warning
                            to make full use of present opportunities to advance long-term goals
                            (Berlintel 1349).<note n="1" xml:id="d199fn1">Dated June 27.
                                (Ibid.)</note></p>
                        <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0559"/>
                        <p>We would not be surprised if further discussion here were to turn on the
                            need for and shape of German/Berlin initiatives in the German problem,
                            the possibilities and limits of relations with the Communist world, and
                            the further development of Berlin ties to the West, i.e., to the Federal
                            Republic, Europe and the Atlantic partnership. In all this we believe
                            that the President’s forceful reiteration of the very real US
                            self-interest in Berlin will be a useful counter to the insidious
                            Communist argument that the Soviet interest in Berlin is more lasting
                            than the American.</p>
                        <p>June 26 was also great day for Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1"
                                >Clay</persName> who were warmly received by the crowds, and
                            especially for Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>.
                            Latter gave stirring demonstration of his rapport with and confident
                            control of Berlin populace by stilling huge, enthusiastic crowd before
                            City Hall into respectful, moving silence while President signed Golden
                            Book to accompaniment of tolling freedom bell. The reflected glory of
                            being host on such a day seems likely to strengthen further <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>’s political appeal in Berlin
                            and perhaps in West Germany as well. It may also serve to exacerbate
                            certain frustrations of the Berlin leadership at the necessity of
                            continuing to work within an occupation structure which can be
                            cumbersome and which they, including <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName>, occasionally feel does not fully comprehend the
                            Berlin psychology.</p>
                        <p>It should not be overlooked that June 26 was a day of some importance for
                            the French and British in Berlin owing to the President’s public praise
                            of their contribution to the Allied effort here and owing to the
                            prominent role accorded by US to the UK and France in the Presidential
                            program. We believe this has given a useful boost to local US relations
                            with the British and particularly with the French. We also expect
                            beneficial local gains in our relations with the trade unions,
                            universities and other important groups particularly affected.</p>
                        <p>In short, June 26 was a great day for the US in Berlin and one which
                            fully realized the several objectives set forth two months ago in our
                            tel 1122,<note n="2" xml:id="d199fn2">Dated May 1. (Ibid.)</note> i.e.,

                            apprehensive over long-run prospects for city, and (d) to give President
                            representative impression of Berlin setting and spirit.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> would also agree.
                            This matter was ripest for solution. Thus if only US mustered courage to
                            get <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> to agree, this step
                            could be made. For if <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>
                            agreed <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would be
                            disarmed.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> then said people in
                            West Germany were now seeking new ways, e.g., <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> too judging by his recent
                            statements seemed to be concerned about present situation and wanted
                            find new ways. US should prompt West Germans to find new ways, but it
                            now appeared that US as victorious power was afraid of the vanquished.
                            Thus, <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> was ripe for solution, and
                            Sovs were pleased they had found understanding re this question on US
                            and UK part. As to further steps, he had <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540"
                                facs="0562"/>listed them in his recent speech.<note n="3"

                                    Disarmament, 1963</hi>, pp. 247–249.</note> Indeed, in interview
                            he had given to Pravda and Izvestia today, he had also referred to those
                            steps. One of such steps could be establishment of control posts on
                            communications routes to prevent surprise attack; such measure would not
                            harm prestige of any country. Also a peace treaty with Germany was
                            necessary because so long as there was no peace treaty there could be no
                            question of disarmament. For before healing wound one must remove pus.
                            This was standard surgical procedure, and Sovs saw no difficulty in
                            doing it. Some people spoke of general elections in Germany, but such
                            elections were quite inconceivable; indeed, they were impossible.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> said he fully
                            understood US desire see united capitalist Germany and Sovs were not
                            offended at all that US entertained such desires. For that part, Sovs
                            also wanted have united socialist Germany. However, US desires were
                            unrealistic because things did not depend only on US desires. <gloss
                                target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> desires were also unrealistic because
                            things did not depend only on <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>
                            desires. Meanwhile, West Germany, East Germany and West Berlin existed
                            and this situation should be legalized. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> suggested it could be written into document
                            that all parties would assist Germans in agreeing on creation of single
                            unified state. Once pus was removed we could sit down and discuss
                            solution of disarmament. There was nothing insuperable. Said he deeply
                            convinced that everything that was being done now was done to satisfy
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>’s caprice.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> went on that while he
                            did not wish to be visionary he did not rule out possibility of US
                            policy prompting Germans seeking a Rapallo-type arrangement with USSR.
                            Rapallo policy had been in both German and Sov interests, and such
                            policy in interest all classes in West Germany even today. This idea was
                            now growing in minds of West Germans and would progress even further.
                            For West Germans had joined <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in
                            hope they would thereby satisfy their national aspirations. They had
                            hoped that leaning on US, which at that time had had monopoly of nuclear
                            power, they would achieve situation where USSR would be forced agree
                            liquidation <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and establishment united
                            capitalist Germany. However, those hopes had not been destined to come
                            true and there was no chance they would materialize. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had said he recognized
                            borders established after last war. US had said similar things in
                            private, and thus only difference was that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1"
                                >De Gaulle</persName> had stated this publicly while US said this
                            tete-a-tete.</p>
                        <p>Harriman turned to <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> who
                            pointed out US had not expressed formal recognition of borders but had
                            merely said force would not be used to change them.</p>
                        <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0563"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> suggested Harriman
                            should not beat around bush: Harriman understood what he meant and he
                            understood what Harriman meant. <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
                                >Macmillan</persName> had taken similar stand, and other <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members, such as Norway, Holland and
                            Belgium believed this was most reasonable position. True he was not sure
                            about Luxembourg, and this caused him great concern. Even <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> recognized this, for he said he
                            had no intention of changing existing borders by means of war. Thus,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> had suffered defeat
                            in all of his aspirations, and was now leaving arena. New man would
                            come, although he, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>,
                            did not know who it would be, but if even he should fail understand this
                            point he would have to go. Other man would replace him and eventually
                            there would be another Wirt (signer of Rapallo) in power and East
                            Germans would sign another Rapallo. Reiterated Rapallo had been in
                            interest of all Germans. For under Rapallo Germans had obtained
                            unlimited orders from USSR and had received raw materials from Sovs,
                            both industrial and agricultural; Sovs had been unlimited consumers of
                            German industrial commodities. Such situation in interest of both
                            Germans and Sovs and would be contributing factor to world peace.
                            Repeated should support forces seeking new avenues, and that would be
                            most noble course US could take. Otherwise Germans would eventually turn
                            against US.</p>
                        <p>Harriman said he not losing any sleep over this. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> had said West Berlin should
                            increase exchange of goods with East. This healthy idea and West Germany
                            should do same. However, so long as Sovs sat on East Germany they could
                            not expect friendship from West Germany.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> interjected this was
                            where main US delusion lay.</p>
                        <p>Harriman commented <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> was
                            very heavy.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> said he weighed a lot
                            but did not asphyxiate Germans. In fact, he was in state of
                            weightlessness with respect to Germans and their interests.</p>
                        <p>Harriman said like in outer space.</p>
                        <p>Harriman continued German question had been discussed by <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> and hoped they would be able continue
                            discussion this matter as it related to non-aggression in West Berlin.
                            Recalled he had told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> we
                            believed there was relationship between access to W. Berlin and
                            non-aggression arrangement. Sovs should take this into account.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> interjected this would
                            not work. West Berlin problem related only to peace treaty. He could say
                            here and now that on basis relationship between access and <gloss
                                target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> there could be no results.</p>
                        <p>Harriman continued this matter would be first discussed in Paris.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> could discuss it with
                            Sovs. Secretary planned stay after formalities of signing <gloss
                                target="#t_TB1">TB</gloss> treaty were over and have talks which had
                            been planned <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0564"/>before. While he
                            did not wish commit Secretary, he believed Secretary might have some
                            response from our allies re consultations we had agreed upon yesterday,
                            although consultations would not be completed. [Here follows discussion
                            of the production of fissionable materials.]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> then said wished return
                            question of Germany. Said he somewhat surprised by what Harriman had
                            said, and although Harriman had repeated his remarks he, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, did not believe Harriman
                            really thought so. Specifically he had in mind Harriman’s remark re Sovs
                            sitting on <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. This remark meant
                            Harriman not properly informed re situation in <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>. In fact, per capita consumption of meat in <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was somewhat greater than that in
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, something like 63 kg. versus 60
                            kg. Same went for consumption of butter. Indeed, during his visit to
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> he had been pleasantly surprised
                            by situation there. Situation in <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> had
                            changed greatly after border and control thereof had been established.
                            People there were very happy with their govt, except of course for some
                            category of population; but then even in US there were some people who
                            were displeased with US Govt.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> continued more and more
                            people in West Germany beginning realize present situation in Germany
                            was to US advantage but not to German advantage, e.g., at <persName
                                corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>’s recommendation US had applied
                            pressure on Germans and had deprived them of orders for pipe. Germans
                            would never forgive US for this. <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> had held meeting with businessmen on this
                            subject and had promised them further development of trade with
                            socialist countries. If US continued to prevent Germans from signing
                            peace treaty, he quite sure there would be another Rapallo. Did not know
                            how many years this would take, perhaps 5 or 10, but this was only way
                            out for Germans. Reason for this was the Germans becoming convinced US,
                            France, and other Allies could do nothing to <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> and unable establish united capitalist Germany.</p>
                        <p>Harriman said <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> mistaken
                            as US had never stopped Germans from entering in peace treaty. As
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> [<persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>] knew very well, West
                            Germans themselves had always been unwilling to do so. We had never
                            stopped them. Not only <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>
                            but also broad masses in West Germany held this view.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> interjected this had
                            been true until now, but turning point was approaching.</p>
                        <p>Harriman continued West Germany would never turn to Sovs so long as they
                            prevented unification. Once Germany was unified, he believed Germans
                            would be much more cooperative. In any event, there was no point arguing
                            who right in this matter. Point was to come to some constructive
                            understanding. Expressed hope <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                            could pursue this discussion when here. Commented US had never prevented

                            Germans and expressed hope what <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> said meant he was ready to tear down Berlin
                            wall.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> said could assure
                            Harriman wall would not be removed even when peace treaty signed. Wall
                            would be torn down only when unified socialist Germany established.</p>
                        <p>Harriman remarked this long time off.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> said did not know and
                            was not saying when this would happen, but what he was saying was
                            present situation would remain until then. Sovs felt fine, even very
                            fine, with wall; they felt cozier and more tranquil. Therefore, Sovs in
                            no hurry. Wall played very important role and he furious with himself
                            not to have thought of it earlier.</p>
                        <p>Harriman recalled <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had
                            said to him Lippmann was right re wall.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> replied Lippmann was
                            right, but it had not been Lipp-mann who had recommended establishment
                            of wall to Sovs. In reply to Harriman’s question he said from time to
                            time Sovs would step on President’s foot so he could realize he should
                            cut out his corns.</p>
                        <p>Harriman had observed previously that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had used this simile in conversation with
                            Spaak. Said did not know that President had corns, but assuming he had
                            how did <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> propose to
                            tread on them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> said that was a
                            secret.</p>
                        <p>Harriman commented that might be <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s secret weapon.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> continued that, for
                            instance, he had seen press reports about plans establish civil air
                            communications with West Berlin. Said such communications would not be
                            allowed; if necessary planes would be forced down and extreme measures
                            would be resorted to. Asserted establishment such communications
                            contrary to Potsdam Agreement which allowed only US, UK, and French
                            military transport planes in corridors. Thus, here was one corn, and
                            Sovs would find corns without difficulty.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> continued he could cite
                            another corn. Western powers now enjoy low tariff privileges for cargo
                            transport in Germany, privileges which had been acquired by right of
                            victorious power. However, this could not be tolerated any longer,
                            because 18 years had passed since end of war. This arrangement entails
                            financial loss by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and would be
                            ended.</p>
                        <p>A third corn, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> went on,
                            lay in following situation. Western powers now using <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> cables for their telephone and
                            telegraph communications and pay nothing or next to nothing for such
                            use. Thus, Sovs would find corns, these as well as some more. Said he
                            sure world public opinion would regard these claims by <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as fully justified. US should take them
                            into account, as <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> might soon advance
                            them. Sovs <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0566"/>believed all these
                            measures economically justified. Western powers had been using <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> territory on grounds they had won war;
                            18 years had passed since end of war—did they want enjoy these
                            privileges for hundred years? Moreover, he wished point out that West
                            Germany had been supposed pay reparations to USSR, but had not paid with
                            US support.</p>
                        <p>In short, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> said, best
                            thing to do was to wash our hands and put final end to WW II by signing
                            peace treaty, so that questions could be resolved on peaceful basis by
                            agreement between Govts <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and West Berlin. Observed as soon as
                            discussion turned to this problem relations between us too cooled off,
                            and this was additional proof this boil must be done away with. Wondered
                            why the hell US or USSR needed it; Sovs certainly did not.</p>
                        <p>Harriman remarked <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> would talk
                            with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> about this question,
                            and did not believe useful for him take <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s time to pursue it further.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> smiled and commented
                            Harriman apparently wanted leave unpleasant questions to <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Harriman said he was interested in what he had said, and had been glad to
                            listen. Said he understood <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had said to Spaak he would take off his hat
                            and bow apologizing after he stepped on corns.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> laughed and said yes,
                            that was way it was done sometimes. One stepped on someone’s foot
                            accidently, apologized, but then ground his heel a bit.</p>
                        <p>Harriman commented as long as <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> said it with a smile, he was not taking it
                            seriously. Said he was not trying throw all unpleasant questions on
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, but noted he had been
                            exiled to Far East for two years. It was Secretary who had been dealing
                            with this problem. [Here follows discussion of Laos and Cuba.]</p>

                            <item>The discussion then moved on to non-aggression arrangements (2).
                                The President made a number of points. First, while there appeared
                                to be little in such arrangements for us, we should keep an
                                affirmative position and try to maintain the mood which Harriman’s
                                visit created. On the other hand, it was clear that we had to get
                                finished with the test ban treaty before we could do anything
                                further on this subject. It was important to find out what the
                                Soviets saw in this proposition, and whether such arrangements could
                                give us additional security in Berlin.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>He asked for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                                >Thompson</persName>’s comments, and Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> pointed out the
                                disadvantages of any non-aggression arrangement in its impact on the
                                Allies and in particular the Germans. The President noted that Mr.
                                    <persName>Harriman</persName> had a different view and asked him
                                to state it. Mr. <persName>Harriman</persName> pointed out the
                                consequences of a detente in permitting a further loosening of ties
                                between the satellites and the Soviet Union. This would apply to
                                East Germany as well, and make more possible an improvement in the
                                East German situation along the lines that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> had asked for. He spoke of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s concern over
                                a possible repetition of the 1953 uprising in East Germany, and
                                urged that we had the same concern. Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> commented on the Italian
                                reaction to the proposals for a non-aggression pact in terms of this
                                as a further step in legitimatizing the Italian Communist
                                Party.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>The President observed that while Berlin was not now in trouble
                                and in his judgment, did not seem likely to be in the near future,
                                the connection between an improvement in the Berlin situation and a
                                non-aggression pact was one that was useful for us to maintain in
                                terms of our relations with the Germans. The President said that
                                while it was important to deal with the West German problem, he
                                thought that <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>’s views
                                were too negative, and we should have a more positive attitude. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> pointed out
                                again the difficulties which a non-aggression pact would create in
                                the Alliance and its effect in discouraging hope in East Germany,
                                and suggested that if we ran up against a dead end in our
                                negotiations with the Allies, we might try unilateral <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> declarations. <pb n="546"
                                    xml:id="pg_546" facs="0568"/>On the other hand, he agreed that
                                if we could make a gain in Berlin, it would be useful, and warned
                                that it is likely that the Soviets will soon incorporate East Berlin
                                into East Germany if they do not get a non-aggression pact. The
                                Secretary doubted whether a mere declaration by <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would answer <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s needs.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>Discussion then turned to the problems of getting the Federal
                                Republic to sign the test ban treaty. The President said he thought
                                it is very important to get them to sign, both from a domestic point
                                of view and from the point of view of the Soviets. There were some
                                discussions of the way that the questions raised by the Germans in
                                the last few days could be answered. The Secretary said that these
                                questions reflected as much on <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von
                                    Brentano</persName>’s political attitude toward <persName

                                of the German Government in general. The Secretary pointed out that
                                while <persName corresp="#p_BH4">Von Brentano</persName> was Foreign
                                Minister, Germany had adhered to several conventions to which East
                                Germany had also adhered. Further, Secretary of State Dulles had
                                taken note of East Germany’s adherence to the Prisoner-of-War
                                Convention and stated that on this matter, the U.S. was in treaty
                                relations with East Germany.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>It was agreed that the Secretary should not say anything on East German
                            adherence at the time the treaty was signed, in view of what the
                            President had already said at his press conference. We could make it
                            plain to the Soviets that we would treat East Germany as they proposed
                            to treat Taiwan. It was left unclear as to whether this point should be
                            communicated to the Federal Republic now, or wait til later.</p>

                                    essentially a Soviet success in long run and that ceremonial
                                    signing today in Moscow constitutes a political victory for

                                    was not entirely clear, he apparently anticipates doing nothing

                                <item>According to Chancellor, who cited this as example of Soviet
                                    duplicity, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had
                                    a few weeks ago indicated to Germans that he would be willing to
                                    pay visit to Bonn and to negotiate seriously with Federal
                                    Republic. (Chancellor requested that this information be
                                    considered as highly confidential.)</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Chancellor began his opening remarks, which lasted 57 minutes, by saying
                            that he wanted to be considered as belonging to those Allies who always
                            state the truth and speak frankly. These were the best Allies. In his
                            recent press conference, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> had shown that he was not correctly informed,
                            the Chancellor stated.<note n="2" xml:id="d203fn2">For a transcript of

                                612–619.</note> The President had indicated that the language of the
                            Test Ban Treaty had been on the table for a full year and that now all
                            of a sudden people seemed to be excited about it. The Chancellor noted
                            that in the Geneva text there was only one depository. Now, however,
                            there were three depositories, because one hoped in this way to avoid
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> recognition problem. What
                            worried the German Government was Article IV of the treaty, which
                            stipulated that it was of unlimited duration but that each party, in
                            exercising its “national sovereignty”, would have the right to withdraw
                            from the treaty under certain circumstances. This reference to “national
                            sovereignty” would, upon <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> adherence
                            to the treaty, clearly constitute an express recognition of the
                            “national sovereignty” of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. It
                            would create an unfortunate precedent which could not be repudiated in
                            any subsequent treaties which might now come from the Moscow talks.
                            Under longstanding agreements, the U.S. recognized the Federal Republic
                            as the only government entitled to speak for the German people as a
                            whole, but now the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would be
                            recognized as a sovereign area.</p>
                        <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0570"/>
                        <p>He could only say, the Chancellor continued, that the U.S. had sold this
                            great concession too cheaply, much too cheaply. With the signing of the
                            treaty in Moscow the U.S. “very probably” had a certain success. Some 30
                            countries had already indicated their readiness to adhere. But such an
                            initial success was not necessarily a final success.</p>
                        <p>At this point Chancellor went off on a lengthy excursion combining
                            references to Bismarck’s fear of the Russians on the Elbe, the parlous
                            state of political situation in Italy and in France (if <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> were to be assassinated or to
                            die) and his great distrust of the political sense of the late Pope
                                <persName>John</persName> XXIII who did not appreciate the nature of
                            the Communist danger. His conclusion was that, if confidence were lost
                            in the wisdom and foresight of U.S. policy, Western Europe would be
                            lost.</p>
                        <p>He was convinced, the Chancellor said, that these various considerations
                            had not been brought to the President’s attention before the signing of
                            the Moscow treaty today. He did not believe that Mr.
                                <persName>Harriman</persName> or Lord <persName>Hailsham</persName>
                            <note n="3" xml:id="d203fn3">Lord President of the Council and Minister
                                of Science for the United Kingdom.</note> (he described the latter
                            as always living far removed from the Holy Spirit) understood the
                            significance of what was happening. The Chancellor expressed his concern
                            that the State Department was not what it had been under <persName>John
                                Foster Dulles</persName>, that policy now seemed to be more erratic
                            and not as well considered. Since contacts were still close between the
                            German and American Governments, he had a personal feeling that this was
                            the case. He did not wish to mix in purely U.S. interests, but he felt
                            this was a matter of common interest. For example, he did not know why
                            the U.S. seemed to attach so much importance to appearing to the Chinese
                            as a good friend of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>.
                            He thought this was a mistake; <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> could come to an agreement with the Chinese
                            tomorrow. Basically the Soviets and Chinese were offshoots of the same
                            tree.</p>
                        <p>As far as <gloss target="#t_FEDREP1">FedRep</gloss> adherence to the Test
                            Ban Treaty was concerned, the Chancellor continued, this must be
                            approved by the Bundestag which was now in summer recess. Its vacation
                            ends on October 9. To call the Bundestag into special session now would
                            be inopportune. It would merely cause excitement, and he could not be
                            sure what its attitude would be on the treaty. He knew that <gloss
                                target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> floor leader <persName corresp="#p_BH4"
                                >Von Brentano</persName> had the same views as he (the Chancellor).
                            However, this was not the view of Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>, who in his general judgment
                            was somewhat softer.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor noted that <persName corresp="#p_SG3"

                            but that such a statement might be made on August 12 before the U.S.
                            Senate. Here the Chancellor speculated about whether or not the U.S.
                            Senate would ratify the Test Ban Treaty, and concluded that he didn’t
                            know. In any event, the German Federal Republic would not want to do
                            anything that would make the position more difficult. However the German
                            press (here the Chancellor noted a number of papers by name including
                            the Springer papers) was strongly against German adherence to the Test
                            Ban Treaty. The Federal Government was being very reserved on the
                            subject, but could not keep the press quiet.</p>
                        <p>Apart from the British, no European countries had been consulted in
                            advance, the Chancellor pointed out. Some would say that to end
                            explosions in the atmosphere or in outer space was a blessing, but such
                            explosions would continue underground which was closer physically to

                        <p>The Chancellor said he feared for the fact that the talks in Moscow would
                            continue for a week. The Chancellor recounted that on August 13, 1961,
                            when the wall was built in Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> went immediately to the U.S. Commandant and asked
                            that something be done to stop it. He had to wait 60 hours for an
                            answer, and then the U.S. Ambassador in Moscow had said to the German
                            Ambassador “thank God for the wall, it will help to solve the refugee
                            problem.” The Chancellor said he had refrained from saying any of these
                            things publicly to date because of the obvious bad effect it would have.
                            When he was in Washington late in 1961, he had repeated the remarks
                            attributed to the American Ambassador in Moscow to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>. The latter said he was not
                            surprised since he had heard the same views in the State Department. He
                            did not believe that the U.S. properly understood the danger of
                            Communism. He then, somewhat irrelevantly, cited a conversation which he
                            had had last year with Eleanor Dulles, sister of the late Secretary of
                            State, who, in response to a query of his as to whether the State
                            Department had any greater influence over policy than before, had
                            replied “no more than last year.”</p>
                        <p>Here again the Chancellor went off on a historical excursion covering the
                            Mongol invasions of Europe and the 300 years of Turkish occupation of
                            Hungary and Greece, as a prelude to making the point that, if the hordes
                            from the East had overrun Europe before, they could do it again. The
                            U.S. simply did not understand the nature of the danger in Europe. Our
                            major preoccupation was Latin America, but the danger of <pb n="550"
                                xml:id="pg_550" facs="0572"/>Communism existed in the entire world.
                            He was concerned about the fate of the free world, which included the
                            U.S., in an era of interrelated interests.</p>
                        <p>After expressing the great personal prestige which the Chancellor enjoyed
                            in the U.S. because of his role in creating the Federal Republic,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> referred to
                            the President’s statement during his recent visit here that the German
                            border was our border and German freedom was our freedom. We were
                            willing to risk our cities to protect German cities. This was the
                            essence of our foreign policy and it was shared by all of the ranking
                            officials of the U.S. Government, including those in the State
                            Department. Moreover, the President, more than any other leader in
                            recent years, has recognized that we must conduct our foreign policy on
                            the basis of growing military strength. We had increased our military
                            budget annually by $9 billion, and with all our budgetary deficit and
                            balance-of-payments problems, had expanded our defense expenditures more
                            than $30 billion since the present administration had come into office.
                            This had greatly increased our military strength. It had made it
                            possible for us to respond as we had in Cuba, and meant that we were in
                            a better position to defend Europe. As a result of this, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> continued, we
                            believe the Soviets were forced to act as they had both with respect to
                            their relations with the West and Red China. We were putting them under
                            ever greater pressure, both economically and politically. Our growing
                            military strength was thus inevitably strengthening the foreign policy
                            of the U.S. and the West.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor commented that we were doing all we could to achieve this
                            result, but he feared we were too credulous about Soviet intentions.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> referred to
                            the alleged remark by <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            during his U.S. visit that his grandchildren would bury us. His views
                            remain now what they were then. We had no illusions about this; only the
                            military power of West could prevent Soviet achievement of its
                            objectives. He did not believe there was any difference in German or
                            U.S. ultimate objectives. We thought we could bring pressure to bear on
                            the Soviets which would deepen the rift with the Red Chinese and force
                            their policy in a direction more favorable to our objectives. It was in
                            the Western interest to use this means of leverage.</p>
                        <p>Here the Chancellor said he wanted to tell Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> something on a strictly
                            confidential basis. A few weeks ago Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had informed him that he was ready to come to
                            Bonn and negotiate with the Federal Republic. This proved he would
                            negotiate with anyone. He feared that, through the Moscow
                                agreement,<note n="6" xml:id="d203fn6">The nuclear test ban
                                agreement.</note> we were causing <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551"
                                facs="0573"/>differences among the Allies and not helping to
                            strengthen their confidence in the U.S. This was regrettable. Some of
                            the satellites which had recently been showing signs of moving away from
                            Moscow would not be impressed by apparent American favoring of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. The ceremonies in Moscow
                            today were bound to strengthen the Soviets. Why could we not have
                            insisted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> come to
                            Washington for the signing, the Chancellor asked. Instead Moscow was
                            made the center of foreign policy. This was bound to have a lasting and
                            beneficial effect on the Soviets and cost them nothing. They could claim
                            that the beginning of a new era took place in Moscow. He considered the
                            U.S. judgment in this matter as lacking in true appreciation of the
                            situation as that of <persName>Pope John</persName> XXIII when he
                            received <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the
                            Chancellor would surely recognize that the tensions in the Communist
                            movement worldwide were greater than at any time in past five or ten
                            years. The struggle for control between Red China and the Soviet Union
                            was being heightened by the test ban negotiations and signing of the
                            treaty in Moscow. The Chancellor argued that, on the contrary, he felt
                            the U.S. was helping <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            and that this would lessen tensions between the Red Chinese and the
                            Soviet Union. He asked again why the signing ceremony had not taken
                            place in Washington. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> observed that we were forcing the Communists
                            all over the world to take sides between the Red Chinese and the Soviet
                            Union and that, in practice we now had two Communist Parties in many
                            countries instead of one. The Chancellor said Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would surely agree that the
                            Western powers had no interest in giving material support to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. The Red Chinese danger was
                            for the future, the Soviet danger was in the present. Yet the U.S. was
                            now strengthening <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            position. Anything like the Moscow treaty would have been impossible six
                            years ago.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> cited the
                            record over the past 24 months of the increasing nuclear warhead
                            strength of our strategic alert forces, the increase contemplated in
                            this category for the next 24 months, and the increase in the past 24
                            months of warhead strength in Europe. Without waiting for a translation,
                            the Chancellor again asked why we helped enhance the status of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> and strengthen the
                            self-confidence of those who were beginning to doubt in his
                            entourage.</p>
                        <p>After a further exchange as to whether our policy was strengthening the
                            Communists or tending to divide them by forcing them to choose,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that, at
                            any rate, the Chancellor would recognize the need for agreement on a
                            continued increase of Western military strength. He was sure the Federal
                            Republic would continue to move in this direction and encourage other
                            Allies to do likewise. The Chancellor said his purpose today was to
                            infect the Defense <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552" facs="0574"/>Secretary
                            with mistrust of the Soviets. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> commented that we must never mistrust the
                            purpose and policy of our Allies.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor at this point invited Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> briefly to give his
                            impressions of his recent trip to Germany, so that there would be
                            something which could be told to the press. He did not want to reveal
                            that the test ban and related matters had been the principal subject of
                            conversation. After further discussion, Federal press chief Von Hase was
                            called in and the general line agreed that Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had informed the Chancellor
                            of the impressions which he had gained during his visit to the Federal
                            Republic and of the results of his talks with Defense Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_HKU1">von Hassel</persName>. The U.S. Secretary of
                            Defense had expressed his satisfaction with the results of these talks
                            and the agreements reached, which were designed to strengthen the U.S.
                            and German forces. He and the Defense Minister had agreed on the
                            continuing need to maintain and to increase the defensive strength of
                            the Western Alliance.</p>

                            at 11 am August 5. Following <gloss target="#t_MEMCON1">memcon</gloss>

                        <p>[Here follow 3 pages of discussion of the Test Ban Treaty.]</p>
                        <p>However, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> continued,
                            Sovs believed basic problem was German problem. So long as German
                            problem remained unresolved, two sides would be like hedgehogs sticking
                            their needles into each other. German problem was such as made each side
                            wish have it resolved in its own way. He could understand very well that
                            if US could <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0575"/>resolve German
                            problem in its own way, i.e., by liquidating social system in <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and establishing united capitalist
                            Germany that would be great victory for President, Congress, and those
                            who supported capitalism. Likewise, if <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> were made part of socialist camp that would be
                            tremendous victory for Communism. But all this was sheer fantasy, for it
                            could not be achieved without war. He wondered therefore whether time
                            had not come when we, mature people who knew life and had seen war,
                            should try move things from rails of war to rails of peace, namely,

                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> and other people opposing such
                            course. It was not only US who had such allies, for God had not
                            forgotten USSR either and had given it allies who did not understand its
                            policy. He believed however all such allies would eventually realize
                            they had been wrong and unrealistic.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said US recognized German problem was fundamental and most
                            important to future of our two countries and of our associates. He said
                            he was prepared discuss this matter with representatives of Soviet
                            Government during his stay here in order to see whether some
                            understanding possible. We on our side recognize that in view past
                            history what happened in Germany was of great importance to USSR.
                            Likewise, again for historical reasons, we too were interested greatly
                            in having peace in Central Europe. US recognized this very well as it
                            had also been involved in two world wars. Secretary then observed two
                            sides perhaps differed in their respective interpretations as to what
                            was happening in that area now. For our part, we believed German people
                            were prepared put past behind them and become part of peaceful community
                            of nations. We also believed we must not make situation such as would
                            deprive German people of opportunity pursue this course or create danger
                            of war. He reiterated he prepared discuss these matters while here.
                            Referring to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            hedgehog simile, Secretary said he not sure who were those hedgehogs;
                            however he had impression that during past few years relaxation had
                            occurred in Central Europe. <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>’s
                            increased relations with countries to East in such fields as trade,
                            commerce, and exchange of persons had, in his view, reduced
                            tensions.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> interjected Secretary
                            had mentioned “countries to East” and apparently did not wish use term
                            “socialist”, but Sovs would teach us to use this term and, after all,
                            time was best teacher.</p>
                        <p>Secretary continued he had been encouraged by this trend over past few
                            years and believed possibility for peaceful settlement had now improved
                            as compared to possibility existing two or three years ago.</p>

                                    >S</gloss>)</note> He has suggested that it might be useful for
                            me to send you a letter commenting on some of the things which you and
                            he talked about, and I think his suggestion is a good one. As he reports
                            the conversation, you talked about two major topics. The larger of them
                            is the question of the basic policy of the West toward the Soviet Union,
                            in which, as I understand it, your worry is that the U.S. may be too
                            easily beguiled by the smiles and tricks of the Soviet Government.</p>
                        <p>I understand this concern, but I must tell you in all frankness that I do
                            not think it is justified. It seems to me, in fact, as far from the mark
                            as the kind of thing I sometimes hear from political groups in this
                            country who say that it is wrong to trust the democratic commitment and
                            the loyalty to the Alliance of the Federal Republic. The truth is, in my
                            judgment, that one of the wisest things our two countries have done the
                            last fifteen years is to trust each other, and I think the record of the
                            United States Government as a whole, and of this Administration in
                            particular, makes it pretty clear that we are not disposed to be taken
                            in by Soviet duplicity.</p>
                        <p>I myself believe that it is much too soon to throw our hats in the air
                            because of a single agreement on a single subject, the limited test
                            ban—important as that subject is. I believe that we have reached even
                            this small understanding as much through our strength and resolution as
                            through the process of negotiation, and I recognize, as you do, that we
                            are dealing still with a government which has repeatedly posed threats
                            to the freedom of West Berlin and which, as late as October of last
                            year, undertook a peculiarly dangerous and reckless act of duplicity in
                            Cuba. So we are not under illusions about the Soviet Government, and you
                            may be quite sure that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName>, who has pressed so hard and so successfully
                            for a strengthening of Western defense in the last three years, is not a
                            man who is likely to be lulled into forgetfulness or <pb n="555"
                                xml:id="pg_555" facs="0577"/>neglect of his duty by a single limited
                            agreement. It is Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName>, after all, who has been my chief lieutenant in
                            a process of reinforcement which has added nine billion dollars a year
                            to our defense budget, and has increased the number of our battle-ready
                            divisions by forty per cent. It was with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that I called up 150,000
                            Reserves at the height of the Berlin crisis in 1961. And he and I feel,
                            just as you do, that this is not time to let down our guard.</p>
                        <p>It may be, as you say, that there is some danger of relaxation in Europe,
                            and you can count on us to work energetically against any such tendency.
                            That is one reason why Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> has pressed so hard in Bonn to find ways and
                            means of meeting the overseas cost of the great forces which we have
                            placed in Germany for the common defense.</p>
                        <p>Our own commitment and alertness, of course, have to be world-wide. If
                            the Chinese should break out into new acts of aggression, it is only the
                            United States among Western countries that will have the necessary means
                            and determination for reply. We are the only Western power fully engaged
                            in a two-front struggle in the cold war, and I think there is little
                            reason for any feeling that we are blind to its dangers and demands.</p>
                        <p>Let me repeat that I do understand and respect your honest concern here,
                            for I recognize also that in a large and varied country like this one
                            there will always be people who can bring you reports that this or that
                            individual or group is spreading dangerous opinions. But such rumors
                            deserve to be set against the reality of what our Governments have done
                            together for fifteen years.</p>
                        <p>As to the particular question of the limited test ban treaty, I am glad
                            to see both in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName>’s and in <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">William
                                Tyler</persName>’s reports that you do regard it as a success,
                            although you have some specific questions about its possible impact on
                            the status of the regime in East Germany. I too think it a success, for
                            reasons which I stated at length last week and with which I will not
                            bother you again now.<note n="2" xml:id="d205fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d203fn2">footnote 2, Document 203</ref>.</note> I do
                            not think it matters much where a treaty of this kind is signed or who
                            claims the credit for it. The point about the treaty is that it makes
                            sense for the world and that it does not jeopardize the essential
                            security of either side. That is what makes it possible and useful.</p>
                        <p>The problem of the status of the East German regime is an important one,
                            and I fully recognize your special concern with it. In our judgment,
                            fully adequate precautions have been taken on this point. We do not
                            think that either as a whole or in its separate parts does the treaty
                            create any danger of increased recognition or international status for
                            the East German regime. The use of the term “states,” which goes back a
                                <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0578"/>year, and the reference to
                            sovereign rights, which is a product of the more recent negotiations,
                            are both of them standard phrases which do not confer any new standing
                            upon any regime which adheres to the treaty, and this solid legal
                            judgment is one which we are prepared to make clear as often as is
                            necessary. Moreover, we believe that the new process of accession is
                            distinctly advantageous to us from this point of view, in that the
                            Federal Republic, which is recognized by all three depository
                            governments, has an opportunity to deposit its accession without
                            challenge from any of them, while the Pankow regime will obviously have
                            to confine its accession to the USSR. Thus the process of adherence
                            itself will make it clear which regime is recognized by all, and which
                            is a puppet of one.</p>
                        <p>Having heard Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s
                            report, I have asked <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean Rusk</persName> to
                            follow up with a visit in Bonn over this weekend, particularly so that
                            you may be able to talk with him about the wider problems of our
                            dealings with the Soviet Union. You will find him both careful and
                            determined. You may be sure that he commands my full confidence. He won
                            his diplomatic spurs in the first hard months of the Korean war, and you
                            may speak to him in full assurance that neither he nor the Government
                            for which he speaks is less deserving of your trust than any with which
                            you have dealt in the past.<note n="3" xml:id="d205fn3">On August 17

                            conversation on broad plane by referring to common <gloss

                                corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> asked for my views on Bonn
                            attitude this issue. Since I did not wish to pursue such a general line,
                            but to stick to Berlin matters, merely said felt confident everyone
                            would eventually sign except the few states whose views were already
                            known.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> said test ban agreement
                            showed progress could be made on other issues. If US would accept
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s “free city”
                            proposal and if it would recognize <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>,
                            Berlin and German problems could be solved easily. I replied that US
                            after many discussions on this subject over the past several years, was
                            unconvinced Sov proposals for Berlin offer sufficient guarantees for
                            maintenance Western vital interests in city. US believes Berlin problem
                            can be solved ultimately only in framework reunification of Germany on
                            basis East German people able freely express their will.</p>
                        <p>Solution Berlin and German problems as a whole are, I continued, large
                            issues requiring extensive intergovernmental discussion and it appears
                            unlikely we will be able to make much progress in this meeting. We do,
                            however, along with our British and French colleagues, have serious
                            responsibility in minimizing points of friction in day-to-day matters
                            affecting Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> and I
                            could make useful contribution to good relations between two sides by
                            ensuring that tensions in Berlin were minimized. Increased tensions
                            could have serious effects on three-year talks now in progress. I urged
                                <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> to use undoubtedly
                            great influence on <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to this end.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> disclaimed authority for
                            East Berlin. He was empowered to deal only with West Berlin. What we
                            referred to as East Berlin was part of independent state of <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, recognized, if not by US, by 14
                            states. I replied that we did not consider that this did, by any means,
                            relieve <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0580"/>the USSR of its
                            obligations under the quadripartite agreements of 1944–45. I pointed out
                            that there was reciprocity involved as between US rights in East Berlin
                            and <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> rights in West Berlin. If Sovs
                            disregarded US interests in East Berlin, they could hardly expect US
                            show regard for their interests in West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>I then raised following specific points: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item><gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> June 21 decree on “barred

                                    “security zones.” These measures could in no way affect US
                                    rights under quadripartite agreements. However, they could
                                    possibly be source of tension between US and USSR. I urged
                                        <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> to exert
                                    influence on <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in order ensure
                                    such tension did not arise. <persName corresp="#p_APA1"
                                        >Abrasimov</persName> said creation security zones was right
                                    of sovereign state. If such zones were, for good cause, erected
                                    in West Berlin, he would not object.</item>

                                    which could produce tension. US wished obtain prior Soviet
                                    assurances there would be no incidents with East Germans before
                                        <gloss target="#t_USCOB1">USCOB</gloss> went to East Berlin.
                                    I urged two sides forget Commandant bans and start afresh on

                            that people ought to be allowed to decide own destiny. Until system can
                            be found where German people can express by means of secret ballot their
                            desires there can be no satisfactory settlement. Knew Soviets cannot
                            agree but <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> said he had
                            concluded no settlement possible now. Hence this question should be put
                            aside and we should address ourselves to more modest steps such as test
                            ban. For instance, if agreement could be reached on observers not only
                            in US, UK and USSR but also Western Germany and East Germany tensions
                            would be reduced. He would not say anything about Berlin at moment.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said he had one or two observations. First, looking at
                            objective elements of tension, these have shown considerable improvement
                            in the last one to three years. Some of elements which have caused
                            tensions between two Germanies and therefore between countries
                            responsible for Germany have been eased and therefore tensions have
                            slackened.</p>
                        <p>There was more normal atmosphere in Central Europe as whole referring to
                            both socialist as well as capitalist parts that area.</p>
                        <p>Secretary continued we still believe valid approach expressed in our

                            to sit down and discuss ways to prevent tension arising.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied Western powers
                            quite aware of Soviet proposals, some of them written, regarding access
                            routes to Berlin which is not at all most important question. Soviet
                            Union had not received answers. Had received some general statements but
                            on some proposals no answers at all. Soviets have put forward proposals
                            for settlement of German question and on this basis question settlement
                            West Berlin. Important to liquidate remnants Second World War. Recalled
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khru-shchev</persName>’s statement that
                            “without settlement of German problem and on that basis question of West
                            Berlin difficult to contemplate progress in disarmament measures.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued by recalling
                            past discussions in Geneva, New York and Washington. We faced most
                            complicated question because no agreement reached on presence Western
                            troops. Impossible for Western troops to stay forever. Western powers
                            should say how they propose to <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0583"
                            />regularize situation in West Berlin. Would not repeat <gloss
                                target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> Govt views but USSR proceeds from point
                            of view that West Berlin ties to rest of world should be unhindered.
                            Also sovereignty of East Germany must be respected. Called upon
                            Governments US–UK to make sober evaluation of situation. Elimination
                            remnant World War II corresponded to interest of powers concerned and to
                            all other states. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                            had said situation more quiet lately but Soviet Government thinks
                            situation dangerous and pregnant with uncertainties. Thinks this is
                            question which must be settled.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> suggested there was
                            nothing much better than present machinery of <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            talks though thus far no solution. As regards Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s complaint Western powers had
                            advanced no new proposals, <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord
                                Home</persName> pointed out it was Soviets who wished change
                            existing situation and hence they should come forward with acceptable
                            proposals. Western interest was only that West Berlin remain free and
                            access unhindered. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                            statement concerning unhindered access gave <persName
                                corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> some hope. But question was
                            how Soviets would underwrite this and guarantee with us unhindered
                            access.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked what kind of freedom
                            existed in West Berlin which is guarded by foreign bayonets. Main thing
                            was presence of occupation troops. How could this be justified after so
                            many years. Important draw line under World War II. Soviet proposals
                            well known.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> had referred to free
                            elections. This argument reeked of “moth balls.” As to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s statement impossible
                            change situation by either side engulfing the other, why not take
                            logical conclusion and recognize existence two sovereign German states.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then took up
                                <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName>’s reference to
                            machinery and said while it was useful and perhaps necessary, still
                            there was danger of relying only on this machinery. No matter how
                            capable Secy <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> or Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> were this could go
                            on 10–25 or 100 years. He was not referring to them in a personal sense.
                            There was no known instrument which could detect progress in these
                            discussions.</p>
                        <p>Secy said, as he had mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> in past, question was more of access to what and
                            this involves presence Western troops in West Berlin. Almost waste of
                            time to go on if this is not accepted. We ready to explore what access
                            arrangements are possible. Recalled that Western powers had once talked
                            among themselves on this problem and story had broken in press whereupon
                            Moscow Radio had rejected proposals even before receiving them.</p>
                        <p>Secy emphasized what he had said before—need for genuine reciprocity.
                            Hard believe few thousand troops in Berlin threatened several Soviet
                            divisions in East Germany. We have been told East Germany was <pb
                                n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0584"/>gone, East Berlin none of our
                            business and instead all demands were concentrated on diminishing
                            Western position in West Berlin. We see no reciprocity in this. We
                            readily concede Soviet Union is great power but so are we. We not
                            interested on theoretical basis on maintaining remnants World War II but
                            had living commitment to more than two million people. We should like to
                            remove remnants of World War II but we do not want this to become seeds
                            of World War III. Tensions have been reduced in both parts of Central
                            Europe by developments in last two years.</p>
                        <p>Secretary commented though his discussions with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> have become repetitious,
                            farreaching fundamental problems involved. As responsible powers we
                            ought to find way to handle peacefully, hence our Principles Paper 1962
                            tried take into account elements affecting USSR not only in regard to
                            question West Berlin and access thereto but also concerning no use of
                            force change borders and question of nuclear weapons, in short, one
                            small word could transform nature whole problem. This word was
                            “reciprocity”.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied Soviets do not
                            fear word “reciprocity”. Soviet proposals took into account common
                            interests. After repeating Soviet line on presence foreign troops and
                            status West Berlin <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said
                            if he mentioned partial measures which ought to be implemented, this
                            should not be taken to mean they disregarded fundamental measures for
                            liquidation remnants World War II.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said would be glad hear anything <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> would wish to say while he is here, before or

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> suggested they could
                            talk about partial measures in tomorrow’s bilateral Soviet-UK session.
                            Perhaps <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and Secretary
                            could talk again before <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and then
                            Foreign Ministers could have basic review in New York.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then asked if Ministers
                            had 10 more minutes. He would speak to partial measures though without
                            prejudice to Soviet belief in urgency settlement main problem of
                            Germany. These partial measures concerned payment of all services
                            rendered by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for communications
                            between <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> (not clear whether he meant

                            transit communications. Mentioned (1) new tariffs for passengers and

                        <p>As last point he mentioned discrimination against <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> in international events such as sports, scientific
                            conferences, etc. All this was part of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he had named only a
                            few points. There were other practical questions which needed solution
                            and all these steps should be taken without delay. Even solution these
                            measures would not affect main problem settlement of German problem and
                            West Berlin. Soviet Union was not against “fresh look” suggested by
                            Secretary but present mechanism was squeaking and not working. Called
                            upon US–UK to consider long-range and basic interests of all our
                            countries and not quarrel endlessly about West Berlin. Our governments
                            have many mutual interests other than interests of militarists of West
                            German circles.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said we must give further thought practical measures to
                            increase well-being and prosperity peoples in this area. Rejected
                            designation of Bonn as militaristic. Soviet Union supported
                            self-determination almost everywhere except in Central Europe. Germans
                            want to live in their own country in their own way. This is not
                            militarism.</p>

                        <p>Using as a springboard the discussion of the sequence of events leading
                            to a non-aggression pact, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> launched into a discussion of Germany and
                                Berlin.<note n="1" xml:id="d208fn1">In the previous discussion
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, after
                                expressing satisfaction about the signing of the Test Ban Treaty,
                                said that it would be useful to move ahead on other questions and
                                added that a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact
                                non-aggression pact was a question that could be easily solved.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then reiterated the
                                U.S. position that a non-aggression pact should come at the end of
                                the road after issues like Laos and Berlin had been resolved, but
                                stated that the United States would discuss the question with its
                                Allies. (Memorandum of conversation, US/MC/4; Kennedy Library,
                                National Security Files, Countries Series, USSR, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>/<persName
                                    corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>)</note></p>
                        <p>He said the USSR believed it would be useful for our two countries and
                            for the world at large to resolve the most difficult, and at the same
                            time the easiest question, because all the difficulties surrounding it
                            were contrived, i.e., that of a peace treaty with Germany. He thought
                            this was both a basic and quarrelsome problem. He thought it was
                            quarrelsome because it reminded him of a story in which some official
                            was asked whether or not he believed in God; the official replied “not
                            at the office but at home”. Thus if one asked the US whether it was for
                            a peace treaty it would reply “in confidence yes, but not in public”.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> recalled that in
                            his conversation with President Eisenhower he had not gained the
                            impression that the latter was opposed. The same went for <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, who had only insisted that
                            West Germany should remain part of the Western alliance. To this, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> said, he had
                            replied that would be all right and it was West Germany’s own business.
                            As to Germany’s division, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> had said two parts were fine and three would be
                            even better. However, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            had said things should be left as they were and we should not hurry as
                            there would be nothing to gain. Yet such a provision could not be
                            understood by the peoples of the world. Also, as Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> would remember, he, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, had asked Eisenhower why
                            the US was arming West Germany and thus was creating a dangerous
                            situation. Eisenhower had replied West Germany was competing with the US
                            in the economic field and therefore the US wanted to make West Germany
                            spend money on arms. This, he thought, was a straightforward answer by a
                            soldier. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> believed it
                            was paradoxical that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            should be the most negative with regard to the negotiations, for it was
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> who had <pb n="565"
                                xml:id="pg_565" facs="0587"/>gone farthest with respect to the
                            question of borders. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            had stated borders should stay as they were, and he had stated publicly
                            what others only whispered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> went on to say that
                            if one looked at the US <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> was the only one to
                            oppose a peace treaty in substance. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> agreed in substance but was opposed in form. The
                            reason for his opposition was that in struggling against the United
                            States he needed a strong supporter in Europe; therefore, he placed his
                            stakes on <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>. While he
                            needed a strong state to support him, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> had assured the USSR he was against West Germany’s
                            having nuclear weapons and that he did not want war against the Soviet
                            Union. This course was in effect political speculation, but it could
                            provoke bloodshed among the peoples of the world. It was also a sign of
                            imperialist degeneration, but he, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>, did not wish to get involved in a discussion
                            of this kind now and would prefer to leave this matter aside for
                            awhile.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> said that as far as the
                            UK was concerned, the Conserv-atives were in favor but they did not wish
                            to introduce discord in the Western orchestra. The Laborites agreed with
                            the Soviet position on this point. Spaak too had said on several
                            occasions that in those European countries where workers’ parties were
                            in the government the governments were in favor of a peace treaty. Spaak
                            was also in favor of a non-aggression pact and had stated so in public.
                            Denmark, Norway, Holland and Luxembourg held the same position. Thus
                            only West Germany remained, and also France. France was opposed, in the
                            interest of a struggle for leadership in Europe. France wanted to kick
                            the United States out of political leadership in Europe and take its
                            place. However, France was too weak to do so alone and needed West
                            Germany’s support.</p>
                        <p>Thus <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> believed the
                            United States’ position was the same as that of the UK. If it were not
                            for such speculations by France, the United States could sign a peace
                            treaty. Nothing would be lost although the gain would not be great
                            either, but the cause of peace would benefit and the cold war would be
                            liquidated. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> has now
                            become a leading figure in world politics, because he wanted to impose
                            an aggressive policy on the Western powers; thus victors were now on the
                            leash of the vanquished.</p>
                        <p>If one were to analyze the Soviet and the US position, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> continued, one would see
                            that all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, including
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>, had come to the
                            conclusion that borders could not be changed by force now, and were
                            prepared to record this publicly but not formalize it. The objectives of
                            a peace treaty were the same. Ten years after Dulles had spoken of
                            rolling back socialism eastward, the West had recognized this but was
                            not prepared to formalize this juridically. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> said he did not know what would happen ten
                            years hence, but the USSR and <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0588"
                            />other socialist states might lose patience and sign a peace treaty
                            unilaterally. The US said this would mean war, but he believed the US
                            would have more wisdom than stupidity, because wars were waged only when
                            basic interests were involved. In this case <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName>’s interests were involved, but then <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> might be dead by that time for
                            all of us were mortal.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished to comment briefly on the situation. First
                            he wanted to make two general observations since they had some bearing
                            on the German problem. He said his deepest impression on this short
                            visit to the Soviet Union was to see Soviet people at work and pursuing
                            their daily affairs. He had also driven by automobile between New York
                            and San Francisco on several occasions and had seen American people at
                            work. On the basis of what he had seen in Moscow, Leningrad, and during
                            his very brief stay here in the south, he had no doubt that the Soviet
                            people, just as the American people, had no greater desire than to work
                            in peace. Therefore, it was up to our respective governments to ensure
                            such opportunity to their peoples. Another observation he wished to make
                            was that, in his view, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> were perhaps the only people who realized what
                            modern war was. There were others, of course, who knew about the
                            military and other aspects of modern war, but it was Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> and the President who
                            carried the ultimate responsibility. It was therefore important for the
                            two leaders to find a possibility of collaborating on as many points as
                            possible. The Secretary noted that the President had quoted Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s remarks on the
                            nature of modern war. He continued that our two countries had a common
                            historical background with respect to this situation, although the
                            Soviet Union had perhaps greater experience because it had suffered so
                            much from Hitler’s Germany. However, it was a fundamental fact that our
                            two countries had fought together against Hitler and they must not
                            permit this problem to divide them. A peace treaty as such did not
                            bother us. In 1954, the Western powers had declared solemnly that they
                            would not seek change of the borders by force; while the circumstances
                            in which that declaration had been made were somewhat different, the
                            pledge still stood and this was fundamental.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that while Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> might not agree with what he was going to
                            say, he hoped Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            would take his remarks seriously and accept that we are genuine in our
                            belief. We believed that any settlements if they were to be secure and
                            safe had to be related to the wishes of the peoples involved. The
                            Secretary said he had no sure knowledge of how the East Germans would
                            express themselves if they were permitted to do so, but he believed that
                            if the Soviet Union and we separated the Germans without their consent
                            and then walked away, this would only sow seeds of great danger and
                            perhaps of <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0589"/>eventual conflict in
                            Central Europe, because the Germans were restless and wished to organize
                            themselves according to their own desires. We agreed and held the same
                            view as the Soviet Union that the Germans should not have a national
                            nuclear capability; indeed we felt very strongly that there were enough
                            nuclear powers in the world and our strong pursuit of this policy had
                            resulted in considerable strain in our relations with France. We saw no
                            desire whatsoever of having West Germany equipped with nuclear weapons,
                            either through its own efforts or by somebody else.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said this situation should be examined. He believed
                            that if we allowed things to develop in the proper direction, more
                            normal relations would be brought about not only between the two parts
                            of Germany, but also between West Germany and the socialist countries to
                            the east. He wondered whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> would agree that considerable improvement in
                            this respect had already taken place as compared to the situation two or
                            three years ago.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary also thought we could make some advance in the disarmament
                            field. There were a number of steps which could in a significant and
                            practical way bring us closer to the solution of the real problems of
                            disarmament. Such steps could remove some problems in the relationship
                            between <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw Pact. We
                            believed there were difficulties at this time with respect to sweeping
                            disarmament but we could take a number of smaller steps to begin the
                            momentum towards real disarmament. The Secretary hoped that over the
                            next several months points could be found on which agreement could be
                            reached, because whatever the arrangements in Central Europe they were
                            based on the hope for disarmament, and we hoped we could find
                            disarmament arrangements which would apply to both the capitalist and
                            the socialist parts of Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary believed that the governments of today, indeed all of us,
                            have inherited some problems from the immediate post-war period. Those
                            problems were difficult and each side had inherited its own
                            difficulties. As to the United States, we had withdrawn considerable
                            forces from what was now East Germany and had introduced our forces in
                            West Berlin. We had done so to abide by the provisions of the agreement
                            which had been previously reached with respect to Germany. At that time,
                            some people felt there would be difficulties in connection with our
                            presence in West Berlin and some had insisted that a territorial
                            corridor to West Berlin be established. This had not been pressed
                            because it had been felt that it could be interpreted as lack of
                            confidence in the Soviet Union. Subsequently, the Berlin blockade
                            occurred; after access had been restored, the arrangements were again
                            such as did not reflect lack of confidence in the Soviet Government. Our
                            two sides must find ways of attempting to increase confidence by moving
                            ahead on measures in <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0590"/>such
                            fields as humanitarian, trade, and cultural. Steps in these fields would
                            all increase confidence and strengthen the hopes for the future.
                            However, at the moment—perhaps Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> would agree—acceptance of substantial
                            responsibility by both the Soviet Union and the United States and our
                            presence in Germany was an element of stability and not instability. For
                            we did not know who might do what to whom if we were not there and if we
                            did not accept responsibility for stability and peace in that part of
                            the world.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> nodded but said a
                            peace treaty should nonetheless be signed. The signing of such a treaty
                            was an unavoidable act after any war. He said he agreed with what the
                            Secretary had said, and the Secretary’s remarks contained many
                            reasonable points. However, the conclusion to be drawn was that a peace
                            treaty should be signed. In the absence of such a treaty, there would
                            always be frictions. For example, if one took the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, the Western Powers had communications
                            going through the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> territory, for the
                            use of which the Western Powers did not pay. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> was obviously discontented and it could break the
                            cables; what could be done in such a case, for the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would have the right to take such
                            action. Furthermore, the US had encouraged West Germany not to pay
                            reparations; even plants which were subject to disassembly and transfer
                            under the Potsdam agreement had not been disassembled or transferred.
                            While other countries, such as East Germany, Rumania, Finland, Hungary,
                            etc., had paid their reparations, West Germany, the richest country of
                            them all and the one most responsible for the war, had not paid and in
                            refusing to do so had leaned on US support.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> said the USSR agreed
                            that a peace treaty should state that the way for a reunification of
                            Germany remained open and that each party to the treaty would facilitate
                            this effort. However, we should stand aside and leave it to the two
                            German states to resolve the problem. While he said that we should stand
                            aside, he wished to point out that naturally we had our respective
                            positions and sympathies: the Soviet Union was for the system in East
                            Germany. However, the West could not change the system in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, nor could the Soviet Union change the
                            system in West Germany. It was not as the Secretary had said that the
                            people of the whole of Germany could decide their destiny; it was a
                            question of the peoples in the two German states to decide what their
                            future would be.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> continued the West had
                            corns in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. They should be removed
                            so that there would be no temptation to step on them. It was
                                <persName>Walter Lippmann</persName> who had invented this
                            expression, and it was a wise expression. So, a peace treaty should be
                            signed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed this was one of the problems. These corns were
                            tempting given the geography of the situation. However, it was <pb
                                n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0591"/>important to resist such
                            temptation for it would be hard for us to apologize if our corns were
                            under someone’s foot.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> interjected he who
                            stepped on corns apologized but then stepped again grinding his heel.
                            The Secretary observed this was not very polite. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> asked whether it was polite
                            not to sign a peace treaty and to have corns in foreign territory. The
                            Secretary said we had withdrawn from Thuringia and Saxony to abide
                            faithfully by our agreement. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> said the USSR did not want West Berlin. West
                            Berlin should be a third German state with a special status to be
                            respected by all.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that with regard to the principle of unification,
                            that was a very important point and the Chairman himself had said on
                            several occasions that the way should remain open.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> commented it was
                            necessary to leave it open.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary wondered whether it was really important from the Soviets’
                            viewpoint to ask the two parts of Germany individually about
                            unification, rather than to ask the German people as a whole. In saying
                            this he was not asking that West Germany outvote East Germany, but there
                            was an important difference here. He was not talking in terms of
                            short-range problems or tactics, but rather in terms of long-range
                            problems relating to the Continent. In referring to the Continent, he
                            had in mind what <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had
                            called Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals, i.e., the entire
                            continental area.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> believed this matter
                            was not subject to discussion, because both parts of Germany had their
                            governments, their parliaments and elections. The <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would hold elections in the near
                            future, elections which ensured the most democratic way of soliciting
                            popular opinion. There was no question of asking the two States again.
                            Furthermore, had the US asked the people of Pakistan before it
                            recognized Ayub Khan, who had dismissed the legitimately-elected
                            government and used armed force to seize power. Also, in Guatemala
                            bandits had seized power and thrown out the legitimately-elected
                            president, and they had done so with the support of the US intelligence
                            service. He wondered whether the people of Guatemala had been asked
                            about it. Another example was Diem, who was persecuting the people of
                            Viet Nam; the United States had recognized Diem without consulting the
                            people, but if it were to ask the people, both Diem and the United
                            States would be kicked out. Therefore, we should not dwell on this
                            matter. He wished to add, however, that the United States had voted with
                            force: it had used force to kick out the British and it had been right
                            in doing so. The USSR had done the same; it had kicked out the White
                            Guards and the US, UK, and Polish interventionists who had been helping
                            the Whites. Thus, peoples had their own ways of settling their affairs.
                            He would suggest that we do not get involved in such a discussion,
                            because <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0592"/>that would only lead us
                            into a jungle. He wished to note, however, that nobody had asked the
                            Spanish people about Franco; this bandit-like government had seized
                            power without anybody’s consulting the will of the people. There were
                            many governments like this.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out there was substantial difference between
                            situations where the form of government was an internal matter, and, of
                            course, we could have a lively discussion about many governments in the
                            world, and the situation, such as the one under discussion, where the
                            question was what was the state, who was to live where, and who was to
                            live together or separately. He believed the people had to be asked
                            these questions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> said he wished to
                            interrupt the Secretary and make an unpleasant point. Under the 1954
                            agreement all of Viet Nam had to have elections four years later.
                            However, the US had not allowed those elections. Consequently the US was
                            interpreting this problem in a mercantile way, namely, it regarded as
                            democratic everything that was profitable.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued he did not wish to press this point, for he
                            realized that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had
                            his own position and that as much as he regretted it, it did not appear
                            to be possible to resolve this particular point this morning.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> agreed and suggested it
                            would be better to put this matter aside. He did not believe the
                            Secretary’s and his efforts would be sufficient to resolve the problem
                            and thought history would have to come to assistance.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> then suggested that the
                            discussion should turn to more innocent matters, such as trade (covered
                            in part III of the memorandum of conversation).<note n="2"

                            <item>In private talk Chancellor went about as far as his personality
                                would permit in expressing regret for “misunderstandings” which
                                might have arisen from his talk with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                    >McNamara</persName>. He claims that what he meant to convey was
                                that Soviet position is getting weaker and that we should not rush
                                to bail them out through agreements which strengthen <persName

                                the “misunderstanding” had caused us deep concern along the lines of

                            <item>Again in private talk Chancellor was quite emotional about
                                withdrawal of six hundred troops from West Berlin.<note n="4"
                                    xml:id="d209fn4">During July the United States had reorganized
                                    its Berlin garrison, reducing the number of troops by about 600,
                                    but increasing its weaponry.</note> He claimed it would be
                                interpreted as a political gesture to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                    >Khrushchev</persName>, that it would undercut the effect of
                                your visit to Germany and Berlin, and that political consequences
                                were far more important than numbers of troops involved. I gave him
                                full line of arguments but did not succeed in <pb n="572"
                                    xml:id="pg_572" facs="0594"/>persuading him. I told him that I

                                him again on this but if West Berlin takes it in stride my guess is
                                that he will not press it unduly, particularly since he is going to
                                Lake Como on the nineteenth for extended vacation.</item>

                        <p>“Dear Mr. Chancellor:</p>
                        <p>Thank you for your thoughtful letter of August 17. I am pleased that we
                            are moving together on the test ban treaty.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that the Federal Republic’s decision to sign the test ban will
                            be to its advantage. As I said in my letter of August 6,<note n="2"

                            only has every precaution been taken to avoid giving the Soviet Zone
                            regime the political recognition and prestige it does not have and will
                            not have; but the deposit of your instrument of ratification with all
                            three depositories will demonstrate in an unmistakable way that the
                            Federal Republic can and does speak for the German people.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> has talked to me
                            about his visit to Bonn. I thank you for the courtesy extended him and
                            for your frank and cordial conversations <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574"
                                facs="0596"/>with him. He said you were concerned about the possible
                            effect of the reorganization of our Berlin garrison. As he pointed out,
                            this action is but a part of a world-wide reorganization of the United
                            States Army. A small reduction in the total number of U.S. troops in
                            Berlin will result, but more United States soldiers will remain there
                            than were present prior to August 1961. In addition, our Berlin garrison
                            will now have additional equipment and weapons which will increase its
                            combat capability and make it a substantially stronger force than it
                            was.</p>
                        <p>I fully agree that it is important that our Governments maintain the
                            closest contact on future problems of mutual interest. In this regard,
                            we are about to begin consultations on issues affecting East-West
                            negotiations in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council and
                            the quadripartite Ambassadorial Group. I believe that our officials
                            should maintain, in addition, close bilateral contacts both in
                            Washington and Bonn.</p>
                        <p>Recently I looked into the way your Government was consulted on the
                            Berlin garrison reorganization and on other matters. While there was
                            contact between our officials regarding the reorganization plan, the
                            consultation was not done in sufficient time. I have instructed our
                            officers to make a special effort to maintain the closest cohesion in
                            the foreign affairs of our two countries and I hope there will be no
                            more problems of this kind. If there are, please let me know
                            immediately.</p>

                                given him the text of a German peace plan. A copy of the plan is

                        <p>I said a meeting was held this morning with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NPH1"
                                >Nitze</persName> and others. One result was that it was suggested
                            that the Secretary write a <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0597"
                            />letter to <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> trying to
                            divert him into making a speech instead of putting forth the plan.
                            Another suggestion was that either Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2"
                                >Bundy</persName> or Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"

                                >Schroeder</persName> under cover of consulting with other
                            allies.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether the German proposal had been put before
                            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council. I said reference to
                            the German proposal had been made in the Council. What we would like
                            them to do is to discuss it in general terms and not put forward the
                            specific terms.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired as to what the French say about it.</p>
                        <p>I said they supported it in the first place and will now, probably. I
                            said this matter was discussed at length this morning in Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>’s office and it was decided that
                            we should try to get them to put it in the form of a speech, which would
                            give more flexibility. I said it was a pretty bad thing and could
                            provoke the Russians into taking some action. I mentioned <persName
                                corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Home</persName>’s talk with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> in which the latter explained
                            what they had in mind. He said the British are pretty unhappy about
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired how it went in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> on observation posts, and asked whether the “New York

                            accurate. I assured the President that it was not and that discussion
                            had gone well.</p>

                        <p>“Dear <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Gerhard</persName>:</p>
                        <p>Thank you for your letter of August seventeenth.<note n="1"

                        <p>I share your satisfaction that the Federal Government has signed the Test
                            Ban Treaty. As you may have observed, the Treaty is being subjected to a
                            thorough and careful examination by our Senate, but I am confident that
                            it will be approved by a very substantial majority.</p>
                        <p>Since the President has written to the Chancellor<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d213fn2">See <ref target="#d211">Document 211</ref>.</note>
                            about the general question of consultation, I shall limit myself to
                            saying that the Department of State, our Embassy in Bonn, and I are all
                            anxious to maintain the closest liaison on questions of mutual
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>Judging by the reports I have seen on the discussions thus far in the
                            North Atlantic Council, they are likely to go into the questions of
                            observation posts and nonaggression arrangements very thoroughly. We
                            have not ourselves arrived at any final conclusions as to our own views
                            on these subjects. Nor will we wish to do so, pending our learning more
                            of your views and the attitudes of the other members of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I must confess that I am concerned about a recurring dilemma in the
                            process of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consultation. Quite
                            naturally we wish to take fully into account the views of our allies in
                            the shaping of our own attitudes on important questions. On the other
                            hand, it frequently is not possible to get the views of other
                            governments except as a reaction to specific proposals or points of view
                            from the American side. It seems to me that we should work toward a
                            process of genuine consultation in which governments, in the first
                            stage, are ready to put in provisional or tentative views for the
                            consideration of the other allies in order that these views can be taken
                            into full account by all of us in reaching conclusions.</p>
                        <p>You raised one specific question regarding observation posts—how the
                            Soviet Zone of occupation could be included in such an agreement. So
                            far, the Soviets appear to be linking their proposal on observation
                            posts with unacceptable conditions. If, however, an agreement on this
                            subject should prove negotiable, there is no question but that the
                            problem of including the Soviet Zone of occupation would become one of
                            the key questions. I would think that, from a military point of view,
                            you as well as we would want arrangements affecting surprise attack to
                            include an area in which there are more than twenty Soviet divisions in
                            direct contact with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces. We are
                            examining various alternative solutions, but have not yet come to any
                            conclusions. If you have any suggestions, I should be glad to hear
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Although not mentioned in your letter, I should like to refer to your
                            proposals concerning your draft of a Revised Peace Plan. I appreciated
                            your raising the subject with me in Bonn before coming to any conclusion
                            and am gratified to learn that you decided to consult in the
                            Ambassadorial Group rather than proceeding direct with the publication.
                            I <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0599"/>have more difficulty with the
                            timing and procedure of your proposals than with their substance. As you
                            know, this plan has a long history. I believe that the textual
                            differences between us are not insurmountable and could be overcome if
                            the necessity arose.</p>
                        <p>As to timing, I think we are agreed that your proposal would not now be
                            negotiable. As you know, the Sino-Soviet quarrel is now in an acute
                            stage and the Soviets have been accused by the Chinese of not defending
                            the interests of the so-called <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.
                            Moreover, the Soviets appear to be sensitive to articles in the Western
                            press suggesting that because of their differences with the Chinese,
                            they are obliged to turn to the West. In these circumstances, I fear
                            that putting forward your plan as a concrete proposal at this time may
                            precipitate Soviet actions, particularly in Berlin, designed to
                            demonstrate the firmness of their position.</p>
                        <p>My greatest concern, however, relates to the proposed procedure of the
                            German Government publishing an exact text of a proposal submitted to
                            its allies in the absence of any prospect of serious negotiation upon it
                            with the Soviet Union. This would have the disadvantage of focusing
                            public attention upon even the most minor change which might be made in
                            the plan should negotiations upon it become possible at some time in the
                            future. Moreover, it would give the Soviets ample opportunity to attack
                            and discredit the plan and possibly take a position which would make it
                            difficult for the four of us to put it forward at an appropriate
                            time.</p>
                        <p>I am, however, in full sympathy with your desire to keep attention
                            focused upon our common objective of reunification, and I wonder if a
                            better way to do this could not be found. For example, could you not
                            make a major address in which you would outline your views on the
                            questions dealt with in the Peace Plan, particularly the problem of
                            reunification? If you would advise us in advance of what you were
                            planning to say, we could be ready to comment in a constructive way.</p>
                        <p>Although we will probably be discussing these questions when we see each
                            other in New York, I should appreciate any reactions you might have
                            before then to these suggestions. I think it most important that our
                            Governments keep in step, and I hope that we can arrive at an early
                            agreement on how best to proceed.</p>
                        <p>With warm personal regards, I am</p>

                        <p>I met with the President today. We were alone. The discussion lasted for
                            approximately one-half hour.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether I considered that his recent visit to Germany
                            had proven helpful, and in particular whether it had been of any
                            assistance in overcoming the recent issues faced with the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> over the Test Ban Treaty.</p>
                        <p>I replied that the visit had, from every viewpoint, been a very positive
                            factor in our relations with Germany. It has given us a reservoir of
                            good will and confidence, both in the President and our country, which
                            will last for a long time to come. We had, however, drawn some bit on
                            this credit during the recent Test Ban Treaty as a result of what the
                            Germans considered to be a lack of full consultation. It was my hope
                            that such a situation would not reoccur.</p>
                        <p>I asked the President if he had an opportunity to read my telegram of
                            September 18 to the Department, which covered my meeting with Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> following his

                            not, I gave him a copy and he read it. He seemed particularly impressed
                            by the negative attitude displayed by the French on almost every
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>He commented briefly on the current German resistance to the negotiation
                            of East-West treaties which might have the effect of producing a
                            detente. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> had consistently
                            opposed agreements with the Soviets and efforts to relax tension. Would
                            he ever change? Would other German leaders share his views? There was
                            some discussion as to whether relaxation of tensions would be more
                            likely to lead to achievement of Germany’s objectives of reunification
                            than a continuation of tension. I presented the view, which I believe
                            the President shared, that a better case could be made for the
                            former.</p>

                        <p>I advised the President of two matters which Vice Chancellor <persName

                                xml:id="d214fn2"><persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> had
                                raised these issues in a conversation with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> on September 6. (Telegram
                                884 from Bonn, September 7; ibid., INCO-Poultry US)</note> First was
                            the question of a visit to this country, which he wished to make as soon
                            as possible after he comes into office, which would presumably be about
                            October 15. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> suggested
                            November. The Department had proposed that he be invited as a
                            Presidential guest.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed that the necessary arrangements should be made.</p>
                        <p>The second point that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> asked
                            me to raise concerned his sketchy thoughts concerning an increase in
                            German trade, presumably requiring credits, with the USSR. I mentioned
                            that this seemed to fit in with the latest thinking in the United States
                            Government to the effect that it might be desirable to increase our own
                            trade with the USSR. Since <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                            seemed to be in favor of a considerable German effort in this regard,
                            the President’s meeting with him might provide the impetus for a common
                            effort. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> believed that the
                            Western nations should concert in their approach to the Soviets on trade
                            matters and should offer similar terms. <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Erhard</persName> also, of course, hoped that we could get a
                            suitable quid pro quo. From the German standpoint, this would be
                            something affecting East Germany or Berlin or reunification. The
                            President indicated he did not wish any German effort in this regard to
                            appear to be something the Germans owed the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>I referred to the forthcoming visit to the United States of Berthold
                            Beitz, plenipotentiary of Krupp, and Axel Springer, the newspaper owner.
                            I said that I hoped the President could see both of them. Each was of
                            great importance in the German picture. The President had met both of
                            them at the dinner he gave in Bonn and had indicated that he probably
                            would be able to see them. The President said he would like to see both
                            of them if his schedule permitted.</p>
                        <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0602"/>
                        <p>I raised the question of troop relocation, pointing out the rumors that
                            United States forces in Germany might be reduced. I pointed out that
                            this would not result in any saving if we have confidence in the
                            continuation of the off-set arrangement and would pose a great
                            difficulty for us at this time in our relations with the Germans. I
                            pointed out what this would mean to <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Erhard</persName> at the time he would be coming into office. The
                            withdrawal of troops would in effect constitute a vote of no confidence.
                            It would greatly weaken his position.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had decided against any force reductions in
                            Germany, although there would be reductions in service troops in
                            France.</p>
                        <p>I raised the question of the observation posts negotiations, pointing out
                            that I felt there was no insurmountable problem on the German side
                            provided we could find a solution to the points raised by <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> in the telegram which the
                            President had read.</p>
                        <p>I advised the President that the Germans were very firm on their plans on
                            the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The President replied we were
                            equally firm. We, as well as the Germans, are willing to go ahead even
                            without the British. He asked what the German reaction was to our
                            proposal that we initiate mixed manning exercises in the near future. I
                            replied that their preliminary reactions had been good.</p>
                        <p>I advised the President that, in my opinion, we should work out a
                            compromise on the poultry questions. Perhaps we could get agreement that
                            the Commission be given a mandate to negotiate a new regulation. The
                            Germans, for their part, did not like the present regulation and would
                            be quite happy to go to some quota basis, which is what we proposed in
                            Geneva. The President asked me to talk with Mr.

                        <p>The President asked why we were not able to give up all our reserved
                            powers in Western Europe. I pointed out that most of the remaining
                            powers outside Berlin would only come into effect in emergency
                            situations, at which time we would grant our authority to the German
                            Government, which does not have similar authority. Until legislation is
                            passed authorizing the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to act in an
                            emergency, the Western Allies probably should retain its rights so that
                            we can enable the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to act in an
                            emergency. I saw no reason, however, why we shouldn’t be willing to
                            offer to give up these rights once the Germans had obtained the
                            necessary emergency legislation. We would look into this.</p>

                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> agreed that measures reducing
                            danger of war are useful and provide better atmosphere as regards
                            Berlin, even though there is no agreement in prospect which would
                            improve possibility of German reunification. <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> said atmosphere of tension affords no prospect
                            of progress toward German reunification, but stressed need for clear and
                            frequently repeated understanding of Western objectives re Germany and
                            Berlin to prevent feeling in Germany that German problem being ignored.
                            After discussion of Test Ban Treaty, President said important thing as
                            regards future consultation is that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                            receives our views as soon as formulated and vice versa. 2) On <gloss
                                target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> President said we should proceed
                            vigorously and should get one mixed-manned ship to sea as soon as
                            possible with US, German and Italian personnel. Early action would have
                            effect of encouraging UK participation. <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> agreed. Re French statement (Habib Deloncle at
                            Strasbourg Sept 23) suggesting UK join with French in European nuclear
                            effort, <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said this seemed
                            more like tempting offer for future than concrete offer for present but
                            reinforced need to proceed with <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. 3)
                            On troop withdrawals President said there would for present be no
                            withdrawals from Germany other than previously announced from Berlin.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> stressed
                            desirability of advance consultation and preparation of public opinion
                            before any future reductions.</p>
                        <p>At Sept 20 session Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_SG3"

                            <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0604"/>He cautioned that pursuit of
                            Western policy to move ahead from problems at periphery to major
                            problems at the center could be effective only so long as we kept
                            constantly in sight (a) basic Communist objectives and (b) Western
                            objectives on the problems at the center. Relaxation of tensions on the
                            basis of progress on peripheral issues ran risk of consolidating status
                            quo on central issues. From German perspective, every arrangement with
                            Soviets which did not have effect of improving German situation would
                            create problems for German public opinion. Constant reiteration of basic
                            Western aims and purposes would reassure Germans these were being kept
                            in mind and would make it easier for Germans to support initiatives with
                            Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> expressed
                            particular appreciation in this context for President’s positive
                            reference in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> speech to need for German

                            not necessarily so, said postwar experience indicated rather that
                            tension has had a tendency to lead to consolidation of status quo as
                            concerned division of Germany. As we move into more completely nuclear
                            world, this tendency will increase. Secretary noted our commitment to
                            German reunification; said question was how to achieve. Achievement
                            unlikely through increase in tension; after all, since 1945 we have not
                            moved one inch toward reunification. <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> agreed but said tension perhaps had advantage
                            of keeping the question open. If tensions relaxed, people would tend to
                            think of present situation as normal and to consider Germans as obstacle
                            to understanding if they keep raising question of reunification.</p>

                        <p>1215. I met for an hour today with EconMin <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Erhard</persName>. He opened by saying that I would probably read
                            press reports of the Cabinet meeting of yesterday to the effect that he
                            intended to assume an antagonistic attitude toward the Soviets. He
                            assured me that this was not the case—that he was opposed to putting
                            pressure on <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> at this
                            time. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> now faces both
                            the threat of 700 million hostile Chinese and the demands of his own
                            bourgeois community for a higher standard of living, which are together
                            beyond his capacity to meet. In order to meet them he must build up his
                            economy.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> commented that everyone
                            seems to agree to this, but different interpretations are drawn as to
                            what should be done about it. Some feel that we should take advantage of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s present weakness
                                <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0607"/>by allowing his situation
                            to deteriorate to the point where is more amenable. He (<persName
                                corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>), on the other hand, believes
                            that we should not act as though <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> were weak, but should attempt to negotiate
                            with him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> made a statement last
                            evening to the effect that he is opposed to the current wheat sales to
                            the Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said he
                            approves such sales if they are needed to feed the Russian population.
                            He would not, on the other hand, be in favor of them if they are
                            intended to build up war reserves, as some say, but which he does not
                            himself believe. He wanted to reassure the President on these
                            points.</p>
                        <p>I told Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> that I was sure
                            the President would appreciate hearing his views. I described that

                                    target="#d215">Document 215</ref>.</note> on the question of
                            negotiations with Soviets and reduction of tensions as being very much
                            along the same lines and quite satisfactory to our government. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said that the German
                            public insists on linking progress in East-West relations with the
                            German problem. There is no distrust of the United States, but we must
                            not give the appearance that the status quo is acceptable.</p>
                        <p>I advised Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> that I had,
                            since our earlier conversation, been authorized by the President to
                            suggest one of two dates for his consideration for his proposed visit to
                            Washington after his inauguration: November 11–14 or November 25–27
                                (<gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 920).<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d217fn2">Telegram 920, October 1, recommended that no formal

                            for the moment keeping the matter of his visit entirely out of German

                            announcement would be made until after he assumed office. He indicated
                            approval of this procedure and said he would consider the two dates and
                            let me know his choice at the earliest possible moment.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> continued that he was
                            anxious to talk with the President about the tactics of dealing with
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. He felt that the
                            economic pressures on <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            are not just for wheat but against his whole economy. If the West and
                            the Soviet Union intensify their trading relations, thereby easing
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s position, the
                            West must at the same time obtain certain concessions on the political
                            side. Otherwise, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> will
                            take their help and once it is no longer needed, will resume his rigid
                            position. The possibility for trade with the Soviets on a payments basis
                            is limited. Their currency is not convertible, which means that all
                            trade must be on a barter basis. They want everything from Germany but
                            cannot give anything in return that a highly developed country like
                            Germany can use. If the Germans extend 5–10 year credits, they <pb
                                n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0608"/>would be faced with renewing
                            them indefinitely since the Soviets would not be able to pay.</p>
                        <p>For this reason, any assistance Germany gives must be in the form of
                            grants as a price for reunification. The Germans would, in his judgment,
                            be willing to make a very considerable sacrifice in this regard if they
                            were assured of positive progress toward reunification. His thinking was
                            that the Germans would contribute industrial installations for the
                            development of Siberia over a period of 10–20 years. In return,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> could promise a
                            complementary “phased program” involving the wall, reunification,
                            self-determination, and freedom for Germany.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> feels that it would not be
                            appropriate for Germany to suggest such a program, since this would run
                            counter to Russian prestige. It would be better if the U.S. would
                            propose that the Russians be assisted, suggesting that, at the same
                            time, the Russians must show respect for self-determination. To gain
                            this self-determination, the Germans themselves would make the necessary
                            sacrifice, which has up to this point largely been borne by the US. They
                            would convince the Soviets that Germany is not desirous of continuing
                            the cold war.</p>

                                corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>’s preliminary views on this
                            subject, which he had expressed to me before I left for Washington. The
                            President looked forward to discussing this matter further with Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> when he visits the US.
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>’s views on increased
                            trade and assistance to Russia would be of particular interest in the
                            light of the recent Canadian wheat sale and the rapidly changing public
                            attitude in the United States toward trade with the Soviet Union. I did,
                            however, say that the President had suggested that it would be better
                            not to portray German assistance to Russia as something that they owed
                            the Soviets, or something that was in expiation for the war. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>I queried Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> as to whether
                            he had given any thought to the amounts that might be involved. He
                            replied that this would be dependent on what the Soviets would offer in
                            return, which should amount to something more than a vague hope. He
                            admitted the difficulties of getting any concrete agreement from the
                            Soviets on a phased program for reunification. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would maintain that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is a sovereign state and that he
                            could not interfere in its affairs. It was, however, necessary for the
                            Germans to obtain something concrete, if they are to be asked to make
                            the necessary sacrifice.</p>
                        <p>In response to my query, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                            said that he naturally expected to visit Paris after his inauguration.
                            He did not specify the date and I did not press him. He did say,
                            however, that he would not discuss with General <pb n="587"

                                Gaulle</persName> the question of German assistance to Russia which
                            he had just raised with me.</p>
                        <p>Comment: <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>’s heart is in the
                            right place, but he displays considerable political naivete in the drift
                            of the foregoing conversation. I think we have an opportunity to help
                            him at this stage, and that he will be especially influenced by his
                            conversations with President and other Washington officials.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe we should discourage <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Erhard</persName> from using his economic tools as means improving
                            atmosphere for East-West negotiations. We should, however, attempt to
                            dissuade him from his tendency to think in predominantly economic terms,
                            and try to get him to look at the Soviet-Western confrontation in
                            broader political and strategic terms.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">M. Couve de Murville</persName> said that
                            the chief French concern with regard to the current talks with the
                            Soviets was the impact which these talks could have on Germany. France
                            considered it essential that Germany <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588"
                                facs="0610"/>remain firmly tied to the West. This was one reason why
                            France concluded the Treaty of Collaboration with Germany. The talks
                            with the Soviets could awaken in Germany a spirit of neutrality. The
                            very basis of French policy in Europe was to prevent this.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">M. Couve de Murville</persName> said that he
                            felt certain that on this there was agreement in principle between the
                            U.S. and France (though not necessarily with the UK) and that the
                            differences concerned the question of tactics. Germany was a divided
                            country, basically unhappy and extremely sensitive to changes in the
                            relationship between the West and the Soviet Union. Nobody can assure
                            the Germans that their problems—especially reunification—will be dealt
                            with soon, not to speak of a settlement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we strongly support German reunification. The
                            Oder-Neisse Line was another matter. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">M.
                                Couve de Murville</persName> noted that France was the only Western
                            country which had made a declaration on the Oder-Neisse Line. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> observed that this
                            declaration had not been reiterated recently. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CMMC1">M. Couve de Murville</persName> said France would
                            gladly reiterate its declaration as soon as we made a declaration.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that despite our strong support for German
                            reunification, we have not moved an inch closer toward realizing this
                            goal. East-West tension has, therefore, not advanced the cause of
                            reunification. On the other hand, a lessening of tension might advance
                            this cause. In general, a detente was bound to work in favor of the West
                            and ideologically the Chinese Communists were probably right in opposing
                            peaceful coexistence as harmful to the Marxist-Leninist system. New
                            opportunities might open up if Soviet controls over Eastern Europe were
                            further loosened. For example, a change of regime in East Germany might
                            advance the cause of reunification.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">M. Couve de Murville</persName> said that he
                            shared the view that a detente in the long run would work to the
                            advantage of the West. The problem was what would happen in the short
                            run. It was essential that this detente is not reached on the basis of
                            agreements which might hurt Western interests. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CMMC1">M. Couve de Murville</persName> illustrated this
                            point by referring to his recent talks with German Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>. He had told
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> that the best one
                            might expect from the current series of talks with the Soviets was that
                            they would not change the status quo. Even a crystallization of the
                            status quo (through a non-aggression pact for instance) would be a
                            change for the worse. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said
                            that <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> had not agreed with
                            him and had instead advanced the concept of “movement” in East-West
                            relations. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> indicated that
                            he considered this concept harmful and that it could lead to a bitter
                            German disillusionment. The Secretary referred again to the possibility
                            of improvements in the Soviet satellites which could improve the
                            situation. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> remarked <pb
                                n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0611"/>that such a development would
                            be most welcome and would in itself represent the beginning of a
                            detente. If such a development came about, he thought it would occur not
                            as a result of talks or agreements but because of changes in the
                            situation and in power relationships.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the Sino-Soviet split had changed the situation
                            in favor of the West. However, we must not count on this because it
                            always remained in the realm of the possible that this trend might be
                            reversed and that the Soviets and the Chinese might patch up their
                            differences. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> asked whether
                            there was anything that we could do to prevent this. The Secretary said
                            that we could see to it that the ball was kept in the game and that the
                            talks with the Soviets be continued.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> took exception to this view
                            which he said was advanced primarily by the British and which he
                            considered dangerous. He said that from a Western point of view and
                            particularly from a European point of view, the Soviet-Chinese split was
                            a most encouraging development. Europe, for a long time, had felt
                            threatened by the Soviets and Soviet involvement with the Chinese
                            lessened Soviet pressure on Europe. It would be a mistake, however, and
                            most harmful, to argue that because of this situation the West should
                            “help” <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. We should, on
                            the contrary, take fullest advantage of this split. The Secretary agreed
                            but pointed out that we must take no action that would discourage the
                            split from continuing. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>
                            felt that the best way to keep the split in exist-ence was not to
                            interfere nor to intervene. The Secretary asked what <persName
                                corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> understood by “intervention”.
                            For example, would an agreement to sell wheat to the Soviets be regarded
                            as “intervention”? <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said
                            that such a sale would not constitute intervention. On the other hand,
                            to conclude agreements simply for the sake of reaching agreements would
                            constitute intervention. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2"
                                >Tyler</persName> asked whether, under this definition, we should
                            overlook an improvement of the situation in Germany through Soviet
                            action. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said we should not
                            overlook such an improvement but he believed it unlikely that it would
                            occur. The Secretary said that there was perhaps one chance in a
                            hundred.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">M. Couve de Murville</persName> then
                            referred to the widespread feeling in Germany that they were being
                            confronted with a choice between the U.S. and France. He said that this
                            was also a dangerous development. It would lead the Germans to question
                            their relationship with the West which is neither in the U.S. nor in the
                            French interest. The uncertainties created thereby could also set in
                            motion a trend toward neutralization. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1"
                                >Couve</persName> said that Britain favored a neutralized Germany
                            and the British therefore saw this problem from quite a different angle.
                            The Secretary said that Germany may become an issue in the British
                            elections. He said he would like to discuss the relationship with
                            Germany in greater detail. A harmonization of U.S.-French policies would
                            automatically dispose <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0612"/>of this
                            problem. One of the causes of concern in Germany was France’s reduced
                            role in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> agreed that this problem
                            should be discussed in greater detail. He said that defense was one
                            aspect of it; another, perhaps even more important aspect, was the
                            general question of European policy, the status of European countries,
                            and their relations toward each other. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2"
                                >Tyler</persName> added that the relationship of the European
                            countries to the United States was another very important part of this
                            problem and <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we were not at all interested in any rivalry over
                            Germany. Of course, we had wanted to be consulted on the inclusion of
                            Berlin in the French-German Treaty of Collaboration because of our
                            interests and responsibilities in Berlin. It was probably unavoidable
                            that as long as policy differences between Washington and Paris existed
                            they would be reflected to some extent in the relations with third
                            countries. There certainly should be no need for a “choice”. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> agreed and said that France had
                            never posed a choice for Germany but “they” (i.e., the Germans) were
                            being told “every day” that they had to choose.<note n="1"

                        <p>What were these steps [following the Test Ban Treaty]<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d219fn1">Brackets in the source text.</note> in the view of
                            the Soviet Government? First, there was the German problem. As before,
                            the USSR attached great importance to it. There was no need to speak at
                            length about this, because Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had spoken in a rather detailed manner about
                            this problem in Vienna, and this made his, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s, task that much easier.
                            However, he wished to say that the USSR still believed that this problem
                            was not only important but also acute. Why was it acute? Everybody knew
                            that certain measures had been taken in connection with borders. The
                            situation was better, and there was less tension now around, and in
                            connection with, West Berlin. However, from the standpoint of European
                            security and of eliminating the possibility of German aggression in the
                            future, the Soviet Union believed that the German problem and the
                            question of the German peace treaty must be resolved. The Soviet Union
                            believed that on the part of <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0614"
                            />the United States Government there was a lack of appreciation of the
                            acuteness of the question of a German peace treaty from the standpoint
                            of the prospects for lasting peace.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued that the US
                            and the USSR had exchanged views on different aspects of the question of
                            a German peace treaty. There was no need to go into those aspects now as
                            the President was surely familiar with them. On some, and even many, of
                            those aspects, the position of the two sides either coincided or the
                            differences had been narrowed. However, when the question of the
                            presence of Western forces in West Berlin had been reached, the US and
                            USSR disagreed and parted. He had believed that in New York and now in
                            Washington the two sides could proceed from where they had stopped last
                            time. However, he had unfortunately noticed that now the US Government
                            appeared no longer to believe that this was an urgent matter. In this
                            connection, he wished to repeat that the USSR attached great importance
                            to the German problem and particularly to the problem of a German peace
                            treaty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he would
                            appreciate the President’s comments on this matter so that the Soviet
                            Union could acquire a deeper understanding of the US position and so
                            that he could report the President’s views to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President said we knew the priority Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> attached to this matter. He had discussed the
                            problem with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> and
                            every time he had met with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>. As far as the US was concerned, we would be
                            glad to discuss this problem. However, the question was whether the
                            interests of both sides could be incorporated in one agreement. The
                            problem was of concern to both sides, and it was not a matter of desire
                            to reach agreement but rather whether we could reach it. One of the
                            major problems was of course that of troops, i.e., the composition and
                            how long they would stay. Another major problem was the question of the
                            status of West Berlin. As far as access was concerned, it appeared to be
                            somewhat clarified and perhaps agreement could be reached on that point.
                            The President noted that the situation had eased de facto in the last
                            months and expressed the hope that it could be maintained that way. In
                            any event, he did not wish to create the impression that we were not
                            interested in discussing the problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> recalled the
                            President’s remark at the meeting last year<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2"
                                >See <ref target="#d135">Document 135</ref>.</note> about the
                            possibility of some legal adjustments in the status of West Berlin. In
                            this connection, he noted that he had asked the Secretary what the US
                            meant by temporary arrangements. The USSR was interested to know what
                            the US view was on legal adjustments in the status of West Berlin and on
                            the meaning of the term temporary arrangements. <pb n="593"
                                xml:id="pg_593" facs="0615"/>He wondered what the expression
                            “temporary arrangements” meant in terms of time because arrangements
                            covering one, or two, or three, or ten, or twenty years would be of
                            course quite different things. He said he would appreciate a more
                            detailed exposition of US views on this point.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that we were concerned by the use on the part of
                            the USSR of the term “permanent”, which created the impression that we
                            wanted to keep our troops forever. In this connection, he recalled his
                            remark to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in New
                                York<note n="3" xml:id="d219fn3">See <ref target="#d216">Document
                                    216</ref>.</note> that all existing arrangements were temporary,
                            and that there were two things wrong with the Soviet proposals regarding
                            troops in West Berlin. The first point was that the Soviet proposal
                            provided for intermingling other forces with Western forces, and this
                            only in West Berlin and not throughout Berlin. The second point was that
                            the Soviet proposal provided for a time limit, something like five
                            years, without agreement as to what would happen afterwards. What we
                            meant when we used the term “temporary” was “pending final settlement”.
                            If the USSR were to say now that it would agree to the stationing of
                            Western forces in West Berlin pending a final and definite settlement of
                            the total German problem, then we could see how stability could be added
                            to access and to internal arrangements. In other words, we had to agree
                            on the full scope of the problem in the final analysis. The US was not
                            thinking in terms of permanency but in terms of temporariness pending a
                            final settlement. Meanwhile we could see what we could do to stabilize
                            the situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> commented this was not
                            much of a fresh look.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that perhaps things were better than they looked.
                            Over the past several months we had done a considerable amount of
                            pulling and hauling in our country, and considering the internal and
                            external difficulties of both of our countries they had done quite well.
                            He said he was rather more optimistic than pessimistic. In this
                            connection, he recalled the 1961 unamimous resolution by Congress
                            against trade with the Soviet Union and noted that now a big wheat deal
                            had been made, which was a change in US policy. The Test Ban Agreement,
                            the understanding regarding weapons in outer space, and the Civil Air
                            Agreement were all signs of an improvement in the situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the President was
                            right that the atmosphere had improved, but noted that unresolved
                            questions remain unresolved questions. In any event, he thought it was
                            his duty to raise this matter and to try to convince the US Government
                            and the President personally that both countries should seek
                            possibilities for resolving it. He wondered whether he could tell the
                            Soviet Government and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>
                            <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0616"/>personally that the President
                            still attached importance to the German problem and that the United
                            States Government would continue efforts to seek a solution with the
                            USSR and the other parties concerned.</p>

                            situation at Babelsberg check point where eighteen U.S. vehicles are
                            being detained by Soviet armed forces.<note n="1" xml:id="d220fn1"
                                >Convoy U.S. 27 had arrived at the Marienborn checkpoint at 8:59
                                a.m. on October 10. It was held up for nearly 24 hours because the
                                Soviets demanded that all passengers dismount for a head count.
                                After being released just after midnight on October 10, it was again
                                detained at the Babelsberg checkpoint and surrounded by Soviet

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> recommended that we
                            ask our allies to approve the immediate assembly of Free Style forces.
                            He also recommended that we <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0618"/>ask
                            the British and French to send in convoys for the purpose of building up
                            allied forces blocked by the Soviets. The President doubted that we
                            should increase the number of forces blocked, believing that the one
                            U.S. convoy now blocked was sufficient. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said we must consider all
                            explanations of the current Soviet action in blocking our convoy. We may
                            be heading for a major crisis with the USSR. Possibly we are coming to
                            the end of a major Russian deception program although he personally
                            doubted that the Russians had been attempting to deceive us by agreeing
                            to a limited test ban treaty and by offering to purchase U.S. wheat. The
                            Soviet action may be a reflection of divided councils in Moscow. It may
                            be an effort to show off Soviet muscle for the benefit of the Chinese
                            and before the forthcoming international Communist conference. The
                            action may be the result of a local Soviet commander’s unauthorized
                            action which, for prestige reasons, Moscow has backed up. No one
                            explanation is sufficient. If there are divided councils in Moscow, we
                            should play out our resistance which might provide enough time to the
                            Russians to get them back into line.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said our first
                            effort should be to align our allies with us. They would be asked to
                            join us in a protest note to the Russians. In response to a question as
                            to whether the tripartite protest would be made public, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he felt that public
                            opinion would move very fast if the convoy were not released promptly.
                            He referred to the public position of Senator Goldwater and foresaw an
                            immediate effect on the wheat negotiations if the present situation is
                            not immediately clarified. If our troops have bivouacked, it is possible
                            that the Russians would permit them to mount their trucks in the morning
                            and pass on through. If the Russians acted this way, we would need to
                            send immediately another U.S. convoy to make clear our right of access
                            to Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> recalled that
                            we had never told the Russians the dividing line between convoys which
                            dismount and those which do not. We have never told them the specific
                            numbers which we use to decide which is a dismounting convoy and which
                            is not.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President’s question as to how the Soviets knew what
                            our procedures are, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>
                            said the Soviets have learned on the basis of long experience with our
                            convoys. The reason we have not told the Russians exactly what we do is
                            because our position is that they have no right to restrict our access
                            in any way. The President read the attached report of the Soviet
                            commandant’s conversation with an American colonel.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d221fn6">Not found.</note> He said it sounded as if the
                            Russians had a final position. It did not sound as if they would be
                            changing <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0619"/>their view, i.e. that
                            we have changed our procedures, thereby justifying their action in
                            blocking the convoy.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> said we should
                            never have started the practice of dismounting troops in the Berlin
                            convoy. The first dismounting had been a mistake. The practice had been
                            continued and it was now expected by the Russians.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed doubt that we should keep piling up troops at the
                            blocking point. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                            agreed we should not so act today.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked that
                            both U.S. convoys be kept in place, the small one which is blocked and a
                            larger one which is nearby and has been cleared to proceed but is not
                            leaving the scene until further ordered to do so. He recommended that
                            additional large dismounting convoys be sent in both directions.</p>
                        <p>The President asked how the Soviets could extricate themselves from this
                            situation. He thought that the only way would be for them to permit the
                            convoy to proceed.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> expressed concern
                            that the U.S. helicopters which are flying above the blocked convoy
                            might create an incident. The President instructed that these
                            helicopters stay high above ground, fly over for the sole purpose of
                            taking pictures, and then leave the scene. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> reported that we have received
                            no information of any kind about Soviet troop movements toward the
                            autobahn.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>, referring to
                            the meeting of the Ambassadors in the morning, said the British were
                            interested in knowing whether anything unusual had taken place between
                            the Russians and the Americans prior to the blocking of the convoy. He
                            asked that we have our officers in the field report whether any incident
                            took place before the Soviets announced their refusal to permit the
                            convoy to proceed.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> agreed that the big
                            convoy, not now blocked, should stay where it is to meet the possibility
                            that we may need additional troops on the scene. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agreed with General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>, adding that if the big convoy
                            left it might appear that we were abandoning the smaller convoy.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President’s suggestion that a large convoy be sent to
                            Berlin, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said
                            such a convoy could leave today from West Germany, dismount in
                            accordance with established procedures, and proceed to Berlin unless
                            blocked by the Russians.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> asked why we should not
                            now order the assembly of the forces called Back Stroke.<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d221fn7">A platoon-sized probe from Berlin to
                                Helmstedt.</note> This force is tripartite and assembles in Berlin.
                                <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0620"/>It moves from Berlin to the
                            autobahn in an effort to get to West Germany. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> thought we might need to use this
                            force. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> replied that
                            it would be all right to assemble this force in Berlin, but not at the
                            checkpoint. If it appeared at the checkpoint, it might appear to the
                            Russians to be a menacing threat with which they would have to deal for
                            prestige reasons. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> said the Back Stroke force could be assembled
                            in eight hours. The purpose of assembling it would be to add pressure
                            against the Russians.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether it was believed that if a tripartite group
                            was allowed to pass by the Russians, other convoys would be allowed to
                            go through.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested that the
                            U.S. commandant in Berlin talk to the Soviet army official in East
                            Germany, telling him that the blocked convoy had to go through. If the
                            Russians have anything about allied procedures they want to discuss,
                            they would be asked to do so. The approach to the Russians would be not
                            to negotiate the release of the convoy, but rather to find out what the
                            Russians are seeking to accomplish. The conversation with the Russians
                            on allied procedures would take place only after the blocked convoy was
                            released.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> suggested that it
                            would be possible to send out armed U.S. bulldozers with instructions to
                            remove the barriers blocking the convoy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> raised again the
                            importance of a tripartite note of protest which would reflect allied
                            agreement on how to deal with the Soviet blocking action.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> commented that
                            we need badly a face-to-face local meeting with Soviet military
                            officials. He thought the commanders should meet at the checkpoint. We
                            do not know how the Soviet commanders would react if confronted with a
                            personal protest by the U.S. commander.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> noted that Soviet
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had
                            delayed his return from here to New York until noon in order to send
                            messages to the Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>The President summarized the actions which are to be taken immediately. A
                            copy of these actions is attached, along with a more detailed list of
                            actions sent to our commanders in Paris.<note n="8" xml:id="d221fn8">The

                                <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> added that General

                                xml:id="pg_599" facs="0621"/>who was in the U.S. on vacation, is now
                            in the Pentagon and would normally return to Paris at once.</p>
                        <p>The President said that if we were asked what our position was now on the
                            wheat negotiations, we should say nothing. We could say that Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had seen Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> in Washington and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> had made
                            protests to the Foreign Office in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agreed that we
                            should brush off any questions as to what effect the blocking of the
                            U.S. convoy would have on our wheat negotiations. He noted that the
                            Soviet trade mission to the U.S. will not leave Moscow for several
                            days.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> said that we should play
                            the wheat card in private with the Russians before we make any reference
                            to it in public. The President’s view was that the wheat deal wouldn’t
                            mean much to the Russians if they were set on blocking our access to
                            Berlin. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> added that
                            if the incident continued to the point where we took it to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council, then we would use the
                            wheat sales as a major point, including efforts to persuade the
                            Canadians not to go through with their wheat shipments to Russia.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said he
                            believed the incident on the autobahn had not been intentionally
                            planned. He could not believe that the Russians would simultaneously
                            seek to reach agreements with us and seek to block access to Berlin.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agreed and
                            commented again that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>,
                            when told of the autobahn situation, acted like a man upset. The
                            incident may have been part of an effort to embarrass <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at the exact moment when he was
                            talking with the President. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1"
                                >Nitze</persName> commented that the incident reflected the use of
                            force to change existing procedures.</p>
                        <p>The President asked that the group meet again with him later in the

                            Marienborn incident he said convoys would not comply with usual
                            inspection procedure, thus causing delay; when convoys complied they
                            were allowed proceed. <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>
                            pointed out there is good deal of convoy traffic at present time, most
                            convoys complied with established procedures but these did not. He said
                            this situation represented nothing new from Sov side, but merely a
                            refusal by US troops to meet usual demands. <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1"
                                >Zorin</persName>, in accordance with my request, would check into
                            situation and asked us check facts as well. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> was not in town but <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> would deliver message those
                            acting his stead.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that our reports on situation differed. I said my
                            understanding was that Marienborn convoys were released without
                            dismounting. In any case Sov function was to facilitate US passage—not
                            grant, deny or control. I again stressed urgency of situation, saying
                            convoys now blocked by armored cars, and publicity bound be harmful.
                            Finally I noted that when questioned by correspondents today I said I
                            doubted that this situation had arisen as a result of deliberate Soviet
                            policy to cause crisis. <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>
                            agreed and stressed that Sov side had no intention create difficulties
                            and that if this true of US side, all would be well.</p>
                        <p>Since my call on <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> bound to
                            come to attention local American correspondents, I have felt it best
                            course to inform them without details that purpose of call was to
                            protest, on instructions, detention of convoy by Sovs at Babelsberg.</p>

                            said the French Government is anxious to cooperate closely with its
                            allies in all matters and to do everything possible to show a solid
                            allied front.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether it was believed that this was a significant
                            test of our intentions. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                                >Thompson</persName> replied that he did not believe it was a
                            deliberate attempt at the top to cause trouble. He said minor incidents
                            of the past few days may have stirred up lower Soviet officials who
                            responded by blocking the convoy. He recalled that we had never given a
                            copy of our convoy rules to the Russians. He speculated that the
                            Russians may be trying to find out exactly when we are willing to
                            dismount and when not. The timing of the current incident indicates,
                            however, that someone may be stirring up trouble.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that the Russians say there are sixty-six men
                            in the blocked convoy while we say there are thirty. The difference is
                            that we subtract a driver and assistant driver for each of the eighteen
                            vehicles in the convoy.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> called
                            attention to the draft tripartite note which had been agreed to by the
                            British and the French.<note n="4" xml:id="d224fn4">A copy of the note

                        <p>The President asked why we should not instruct our commander to tell the
                            Russians that they must release the blocked convoy but that we were
                            prepared thereafter to talk about existing convoy procedures. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that we had
                            already instructed ourcommander, General <persName corresp="#p_BMGWC1"
                                >Baker</persName>, to do just this.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked whether it
                            would not be wise for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                                >Thompson</persName> to discuss thecurrent situation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> again, telling him the details
                            of our convoy dismountingpractices. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1"
                                >Nitze</persName> pointed out the difficulty of explaining allied
                            practices which vary. He said that we must not get in a position of
                            negotiating about procedures because our right of access if not
                            negotiable, i.e., it arises out of our conquest of Germany.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> reported that
                            the French had agreed to the assembly of the Free Style forces and the
                            British Ambassador said he had sufficient authority to do so without
                            reference to London.<note n="5" xml:id="d224fn5"><persName

                                and French made these statements. (Telegram 1052 to Bonn, October

                        <p>The President asked whether the allies think the situation serious and
                            whether they believe our position is justified. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> replied that all agree the
                            situation is serious, that it has been planned for, and, therefore, we
                            should go ahead as had beenagreed earlier.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that the longer the situation goes on the more
                            serious it becomes. He believed we should make one attempt to straighten
                            out any misunderstanding about numbers with the Russians. In the
                            meantime, we should avoid sending convoys which fall within the disputed
                            area.</p>
                        <p>The President instructed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                                >Thompson</persName> to ask Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> to tell <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1"
                                >Zorin</persName> toinstruct the Russian commander to meet with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_BMGWC1">Baker</persName> as soon as
                            possible to discussdismounting procedures. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> should tell <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> of the numbers we use and
                            explain why we are not now changing the procedures, adding thatweare
                            ready to talk procedures as soon as the convoy is released.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the tripartite protest could be made public.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> expressed the hope
                            that the entire situation would be cleared up before the note was
                            published.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName>’s suggestion that Free Style forces be assembled
                            first thing tomorrow rather than during the night. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> questioned whether we should
                            assemble the Free Style forces. If the Russian action was the result of
                            a mistake, the assembly of the Free Style forces would complicate Soviet
                            efforts to correct the situation. The President said that if it takes
                            two days to assemble the forces, he believed we should begin now to
                            bring them together, and he instructed that the assembly begin
                            tomorrow.</p>

                                the conversation with <persName corresp="#p_SMN1"

                            on the holdup of our convoy on the autobahn. I said our position was
                            that our right of free access to Berlin meant that we had no obligation
                            to give notification or dismount troops in convoys, but that in order to
                            facilitate the movement of convoys certain practices had grown up. I
                            said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> seemed to be
                            confused as he had mentioned that we dismounted whenever a convoy
                            consisted of more than five vehicles. I said this had never been the
                            case and he was apparently confused by the fact that we often gave the
                            checkpoint prior notification when the convoy was larger than five
                            vehicles. I explained what our actual practice was with regard to
                            dismounting and gave him a factual account of what had happened in the
                            last few days.</p>
                        <p>When the Ambassador asked what I wanted him to do, I urged that he
                            explain the facts to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>
                            and urge that our convoy be allowed to proceed. At first the Ambassador
                            was very reluctant, and did not seem convinced by my arguments.</p>
                        <p>At this time, General <persName corresp="#p_CLD1">Clay</persName>
                            telephoned me and gave me a list of the dates of our convoys of similar
                            size since May first, including number of vehicles and number of men
                            involved. I pointed out that only two had been held up and these for
                            short periodsof time.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador seemed impressed by this list and particularly the fact
                            that similar convoys had been passed on August twenty-sixth and
                            September thirtieth.</p>
                        <p>I also pointed out that the Soviets now knew that the information we had
                            given them concerning the number of men in the disputed convoy was
                            accurate and there was, therefore, no longer any reason to hold it
                            up.</p>
                        <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0628"/>
                        <p>He said of course that the question of principle and procedure was now
                            involved, but agreed to send a message to <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1"
                                >Zorin</persName> promptly. He indicated that he and <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had been quiteupset over this
                            incident and the attention being given to it inthe press.</p>
                        <p>I also referred to the difficulty which this caused us and the setback to
                            our efforts toimprove relations.</p>
                        <p>As he was leaving, he said it was incomprehensible to him how this could
                            have happened.</p>

                                >Sov</gloss> authorities had made thorough investigation of Berlin
                            situation and had ascertained that situation described by me did not
                            correspond to facts.<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2">Shortly before noon
                                October 12, the Soviets removed the vehicles blocking Convoy U.S. 27
                                and processed the convoy into Berlin.</note></p>
                        <p>According to <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>, facts were
                            that early this morning convoy consisting of 18 vehicles, 61 men,
                            appeared at checkpoint, refused comply with established procedures and
                            was held up. Such refusal, said <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1"
                                >Zorin</persName>, was clearly in violation of agreed understanding
                            that personnel in convoys of more than five vehicles were obliged to
                            dismount. Shortly thereafter a second convoy consisting of 27 vehicles
                            and 140 personnel complied with existing procedures and thus was cleared
                            by Soviet authorities. Thereupon a US Army major appeared on the scene
                            and informed <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> officer in charge at
                            checkpoint that convoy which had already been cleared would not proceed
                            until other convoy also cleared. When <gloss target="#t_SOV1"
                                >Sov</gloss> officer in charge refused to accede to US officer’s
                            demand latter ordered the second convoy to stand in place and as result
                            both convoys remain at checkpoint. Thus, according to <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>, it is crystal clear <pb n="607"
                                xml:id="pg_607" facs="0629"/>from carefully checked facts that there
                            has been no violation of established procedures on part <gloss
                                target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> authorities, that hold up is result of
                            deliberately planned maneuver of US military authorities in Berlin who
                            have themselves attempted unilaterally to change existing procedures and
                            establish new ones. It is obvious to the <gloss target="#t_SOV1"
                                >Sov</gloss> Govt that the US military authorities in Berlin have
                            incorrectly informed the US Govt of the situation at checkpoint and have
                            deliberately acted in such a way as to complicate situation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> continued that <gloss
                                target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> military authorities are under strict
                            orders to carry out established procedures; if US authorities should
                            abide by such procedures then there would be no problem. Appropriate
                            instructions, therefore, should be given to US military authorities to
                            comply with procedures and to avoid complicating situation in Berlin.
                            With regard to general <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> policy,
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> said <gloss
                                target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> Govt stands for peace, has no intention
                            of doing anything to worsen existing relationships. For reasons he had
                            stated <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> said <gloss
                                target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> Govt could not accept protest which I
                            had made in earlier meeting.</p>
                        <p>In reply I questioned <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>’s
                            statement with regard to what he referred to as an agreed understanding
                            that convoys of more than five vehicles were subject to the dismounting
                            procedure. I said that in my long experience with Berlin problems I had
                            never heard that such an agreement existed. My understanding was that
                            the principal requirement was that <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>
                            authorities should be in a position to estimate the number of personnel
                            in a particular convoy and if for this purpose dismounting should be
                            required then it would be so ordered by the convoy commander. Meanwhile
                            I could assure him that our military authorities had strict instructions
                            to comply with established procedures but also were obliged to insure
                            that existing procedures were not changed unilaterally by <gloss
                                target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> authorities. Obviously then our
                            military authorities regarded the requirement to dismount in this case
                            as a deviation from standing procedures on the part of <gloss
                                target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> authorities and thus they had refused
                            to comply. While I would, of course, report <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1"
                                >Zorin</persName>’s remarks immediately to my govt, I hoped that
                            current situation could be liquidated and convoys permitted to proceed.
                            If the problem had arisen as a result of disagreement between us as to
                            what size convoy should be subjected to the dismounting procedure, then
                            perhaps this was a question which should be discussed between us
                            later.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> countered with a reiteration
                            of his argument that the present crisishad arisen because of the refusal
                            of one convoy to comply with the procedure with which similar convoy had
                            complied. He could see no logic in this. He pointed out that from time
                            to time our military authorities have deliberately created incidents
                            which complicate the situation in Berlin; the last of these took place
                            in May when a convoy was also delayed for several hours. In his view, if
                            US military authorities would <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0630"
                            />complywith existing procedures in every case then there would be no
                            incident.</p>
                        <p>I again told <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> that in my view
                            there was clearly a difference between us as to what constituted normal
                            practices and procedures. So far as I was aware there existed no
                            agreement as to what size convoy should be subject to the dismounting
                            procedure; our authorities followed the practice of dismounting only to
                            facilitate a determination by <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>
                            authorities as to number of personnel in the convoy. In all honesty and
                            contrary to his assertion, we had had the impression that the <gloss
                                target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> military, to use a phrase I had
                            sometimes heard, were trying to “tread on our corns”.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> said he could not agree. It
                            was perfectly clear from the facts of the situation that <gloss
                                target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> authorities had not introduced nor did
                            they intend to introduce any change in existing procedures. On the other
                            hand, it was equally clear that our military authorities wished
                            precisely to do this. In <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>’s
                            view, refusal to comply with existing procedures was a deliberate act on
                            the part of our military authorities.</p>
                        <p>I again assured <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> I would
                            report his remarks and once more expressed the hope that the present
                            tension could be removed. Subsequently we could discuss in the proper
                            forum what was an obvious disagreement as to established procedures.
                            Meanwhile I could assure <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>
                            that neither the US Govt nor US military authorities had attempted to
                            change what we understand as established procedures.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> concluded the conversation
                            by expressing the hope that our military authorities would be given
                            instructions to comply with existing procedures.</p>

                        <p>While I was in Cincinnati at the Hebrew Union College on Saturday,
                            October 12, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> called me
                            from New York. His mood was friendly and he used my first name
                            throughout.</p>
                        <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0631"/>
                        <p>He opened by saying that he had received additional information from
                            Moscow containing details from their military in Germany, in which he
                            expressed confidence, to the effect that United States military in
                            Germany had attempted to change existing procedures on the autobahn. He
                            emphasized (a) that it was not the Soviet intention to change existing
                            procedures in any respect and that it was important for both sides (and
                            he repeated bothsides) to adhere meticulously to existing arrangements;
                            (b) he wished to underline strongly what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1"
                                >Zorin</persName> had told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                >Kohler</persName>, namely, that the Soviet Government did not wish
                            to create any incidents with respect to Berlin which might increase
                            tensions; (c) he was most anxious that the recent incident on the
                            autobahn not be interpreted as limiting or cutting across what Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said to
                            thePresident about Soviet general policy during his visit at the White
                            House. He asked me personally to look into the recent incident to see if
                            I would not agree that our own military had attempted to change existing
                            procedures.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I had looked into these procedures in considerable detail
                            but that I would review it again. I said that our view was that our
                            military had indeed complied with procedures well established by
                            practice and that the incident arose because of what seemed to us to be
                            a unilateral effort by Soviet military to interfere with such
                            existingprocedures. I told him that some misunderstanding might have
                            been possible because the Soviets may not themselves be clear as to our
                            own procedures. I said that we could not accept any limitation of our
                            rights of access by agreements on procedures that in any way limited
                            such access but that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                                >Thompson</persName> had talked about our practice with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and I felt that this
                            could help to clarify the situation. I also expressedappreciation for
                            what I felt had been the effort made by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> to get the recent incident resolved as quickly
                            as possible. He indicated his unhappiness about the recent treatment of
                            the autobahn incident in the American press, and I told him that we were
                            attempting to help the press to keep the matter in perspective and hoped
                            their people would do the same.</p>
                        <p>With regard to a General Assembly resolution on bombs in orbit, I told
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that Ambassador
                            Stelle and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> would be
                            available in New York, beginning on Monday, and that Ambassador Stelle
                            was in New York over the weekend if he were needed for any points of
                            clarification. He indicated that hewould probably not take up the matter
                            before Monday.</p>

                            preliminary assessment Soviet motives and conduct in Autobahn
                            incidents.</p>
                        <p>Our review of probable Soviet motives suggests that delay US convoys
                            Autobahn October 10 to 12 did not mark any shift in Soviet policy either
                            with respect Soviet efforts to secure general easing of international
                            tensions or with respect to continued Soviet efforts to press for small
                            unilateral advantages on Berlin scene.</p>
                        <p>On basis our preliminary reconstruction events, we believe USSR did not
                            intend to bring about major confrontation last week, and train events
                            may have been set in motion by no higher ranking a person than
                            Marienborn checkpoint commander. His move was supported by his superiors
                            and apparently also at ministerial level in Moscow. Higherlevel Soviet
                            authorities may not have been fully informed concerning US criteria in
                            accordance with which troops are dismounted from vehicles as a matter of
                            courtesy. Release of convoy at Babelsberg on Saturday may well have been
                            result of Presidium-level intervention when it became apparent that
                            broader foreign policy goals were in jeopardy.</p>
                        <p>This interpretation of events does not, however, absolve Moscow from
                            responsibility for continuing Soviet efforts to erode Western rights in
                            Berlin and on access routes. So long as day-to-day practice calls for
                            making attempts at nibbling away at Western rightsand imposing tighter
                            controls, possibilities will exist that further serious incidents may
                            occur on Autobahn or other routes to Berlin and in City.<note n="2"

                                evaluated the events quite differently. In telegram 479 from Berlin,
                                October 13, <persName corresp="#p_HCEJ1">Hulick</persName> concluded
                                that theSoviet action “was deliberate and had both important
                                tactical and political motives.” It seemed clear that the Soviet
                                Union had the “aim of stepping on corns as general and overriding
                                goal from the beginning.” The convoy was released only when it
                                became clear that the United States would not change its Autobahn
                                procedures and after the crisis had escalated sufficiently to
                                constitute a serious issue for the UnitedStates at a high political
                                level. (Ibid., POL 38–10) In telegram 1253 from Moscow on October
                                13, <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> reported his
                                conviction that the Soviet Government had not intended to provoke an
                                incident at that time. He speculated that mid-level Soviet
                                authorities in Germany had initiated the incident, possibly after a
                                routine check with Moscow, and concluded that there was probably
                                considerable confusion on the Soviet side about U.S. convoy
                                procedures, a fact that contributed to the problem.

                        <p>In event <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Reps inquire under what
                            circumstances troops are dismounted from convoys you may inform them
                            that principal criterion is number of troops in convoy; in general, we
                            dismount convoys which include 31 or more personnel in addition to
                            driver and assistant driver of each vehicle (we also informed Soviets of
                            above 31 figure during the course of the discussions which took place at
                            the time of last week’s crisis). We did not and do not concede that
                            Soviets have any legal or other right to demand dismounting of more than
                            30-man convoys. We exercise this action at our own initiative as a
                            matter of simple administrative procedure to facilitate processing
                            through checkpoints. Smaller groups clearly do not require dismounting
                            since number of men in group can be quickly and easily calculated.</p>

                                apparently took liking to practice and it became standard part of

                                attempted to reach agreement on standard procedures. This attempt
                                apparently failed because US and French were unwilling to adopt UK
                                procedures. These went too far to meet Soviet demands, which USand
                                French deemed unreasonable. British were unwilling to adopt US
                                procedures since to do so would require them in effectto engage in a
                                roll-back vis-à-vis the Soviets.Bonn Embassies recommended to
                                governments that they agree to disagree on procedures but to back
                                each other in case of trouble. UK Foreign Office approved this
                                recommendation and declined our (bilateral) proposal to consider

                            <item>Recent Soviet actions have focused attention again on procedural
                                differences. Three Commandants in Berlin have suggested common

                                procedures (Berlin 504). Quadripartite Bonn Ambassadorial Group
                                (Bonn 1378) has recommended to governments and Washington
                                Ambassadorial Group that Soviets be informed ofAllied procedures in
                                such a way as to preclude negotiations on procedures. It has also
                                recommended that this should be done independently of harmonization
                                but that subsequent attempt be made to harmonize procedures in such
                                way as to avoid weakening our position.</item>

                                <p>In view opportunity presented by recent incidents, we believe we
                                    should make serious new effort harmonize procedures. We are
                                    mindful, however, that convoy procedures, even on three disputed
                                    questions, are complicated, and it may not be easy to work out
                                    agreed formulae. We are now awaiting General <persName

                            <item>Whether we can agree on procedures or not, we are also inclined
                                support recommendations of Commandants and Bonn Ambassadors that we
                                inform Soviets. (We have already given Soviets certain information
                                on dismount procedure in connection recent convoy incident.)</item>

                            <item>Our attitude toward locale for informing Soviets will depend on
                                whether Allies agree on procedures. If we do, we would favor
                                aide-memoire delivered in Moscow. If we do not, we would favor

                                            Union would avoid future incidents. It would, however,
                                            maximize Allied unity on access and put the West in the

                        <p>The Secretary of State met with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Erhard</persName> October 25. There were present, in addition to
                            myself, State Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName>
                            and Dr. <persName>Osterheld</persName> from the Chancellor’s Office. The
                            Chancellor welcomed the Secretary and expressed the pleasure it gave him
                            to be able to receive Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>. He
                            reiterated that Germany would continue to be loyal to the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance and to the United States. He
                            was glad to report that the opposition had, up to this point, received
                            favorably the policy statement he had made upon assuming office with his
                            new Government. The Secretary said that he in turn wished to
                            congratulate the Chancellor upon his new position. The Chancellor’s
                            policy statement had received a very favorable response in the United
                            States. Both the President and he looked forward to the Chancellor’s
                            visit to the United States. In the meantime, Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> would be visiting Bonn and could
                            go over with him the various matters which might be the subject of
                            discussion in Washington.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said that when he was in Washington he would reaffirm the
                            understanding that existed between the two countries. There is, he said,
                            complete confidence in the U.S. on the part of the German Government and
                            members of the Bundestag. However, public reaction is more volatile.
                            There is “a lingering fear in the public mind that troops will be
                            reduced in the future.”</p>
                        <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0639"/>
                        <p>The Secretary reassured the Chancellor that he would deal with this
                            matter in his Frankfurt speech.<note n="2" xml:id="d232fn2">For text of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>’s address on October
                                27, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                                November 11, 1963, pp. 726–731.</note> He said he wished to
                            emphasize in this connection the burdens that the U.S. had borne in the
                            post-war period. For example, the United States has since 1945 sustained
                            100,000 casualties in the cold war, and has casualties every day inSouth
                            Viet-Nam.He was afraid that expressions in the German press of distrust
                            toward theUnited States had caused a bad reaction in our country.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said that the German questions about retention of United
                            States forcesand continuing interest in Germany should be considered as
                            a “mark of respect”for the United States. Germans are dismayed at the
                            possibility of “getting out of touch” with the United States. There is
                            no possibility for the defense of Germany unless America is “in on it”.
                            The public reaction was not altogether rational, but it was a factor
                            which had to be taken into account. He sometimes felt that theGerman
                            people panic into too high a state of excitement in the face of an
                            uncertainty. This happened during the recent autobahn incidents.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said he would make his
                            own position perfectly clear when he was in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed that both governments should be mindful of one
                            another’s public opinion problems. He asked the Chancellor what the
                            reaction of the German people wouldbe if they knew how much actual
                            atomic strength presently existed in Germany in U.S. custody.</p>
                        <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said the people
                            were advised on this point, but there would be no adverse reaction if
                            they had even more information.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he was struck by the great opportunity which
                            leaders such as the Chancellor and President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> had at the present time. Very great historical
                            changes were in progress. Any such situation had its risks but also
                            offered opportunities.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said that he too felt that the speed of change in the
                            world was greater than ever before. The West should be firm with regard
                            to principles, but not rigid tactically. He hoped to talk with the
                            President about a number of things. There were a number of questions in
                            his mind. What had motivated the Russians in the recent autobahn
                            incident? Was it to show strength in the face of a possible suspicion of
                            weakness or was it to build up bargaining points to use in later
                            negotiations?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that several explanations could be offered for
                            Soviet actions on the autobahn. One, which he had considered, was that
                            the people on the spot had probably suspected that we were trying to
                            tighten up our dismount procedures and reacted without advice from <pb
                                n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0640"/>Moscow. He was convinced that
                            neither <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> nor <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> knew of the incident. Once they
                            were apprised of it, they had attempted to iron matters out. There was
                            certainly no evidence that Moscow had originated the incident.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said a new uncertainty would
                            be added to the situation if, in addition to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s power, there was some independent military
                            power in the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he did not believe that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> himself had stimulated the
                            autobahn incident. If he had done so, it would in all probability have
                            been more serious. The Soviet representatives at the checkpoint would
                            not in the end have accepted our existing procedures. He pointed out
                            that our own bureaucracy sometimes gets into the same sort of situation
                            as the Russian representatives on the autobahn did. Admittedly, however,
                            the subsequent incident affecting a UK dismount convoy lookeddifferent.
                            He was not surethat the explanation of the first convoy incident still
                            held good for the second.</p>
                        <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> asked if there
                            were any other suggestions which were being considered for discussion by
                            the United States with the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that prospects for further discussions were not very
                            good. He wanted to make it clear that there was at the present time no
                            detente. There was, so to speak, only a hunting license for a detente.
                            The nonaggression pact was dead because the Soviets would not come clean
                            on Berlin. The observation post negotiations were dead becausethe
                            Soviets associated them with nuclear free zones. The question of
                            agreement on non-dissemination of nuclear weapons was dead because the
                            Soviets linked it with <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. There was no
                            agreement on Cuba or Laos.</p>
                        <p>It was possible that we might make a limited agreement in the field of
                            civil aviation exchanging one or two civil flights a week. There might
                            be some increased trade with the Soviets, but not much, because there
                            was not much that Americans wished to buy from the Soviet Union. The
                            Soviets had proposed to decrease defense budgets. However, this was
                            unacceptable to the United States in the absence of inspection. The big
                            problems with Russia still remain unsolved.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that in his opinion complete agreement with the
                            Soviets will take a long time and will be achieved only through small
                            steps. There is no possibility of moving rapidly to a detente. At the
                            same time there is danger of people thinking there is a detente which
                            does not exist.</p>

                        <p>Approaching political problems as a retired professor of economics,
                            Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> is preoccupied
                            with the thought that West Germany might buy an agreement
                            forreunification from the Russians through the use of their industrial
                            capability. While the idea is apparently still in an inchoate state, the
                            general scheme would be to offer the Soviet Union grants or long-term
                            loans of perhaps $2.5 billion a year for ten or more years in
                            consideration that the Soviets agree to a phased program of
                            self-determination for Germany. This proposal has been reflected in
                            telegrams from <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">George McGhee</persName>

                        <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> has now indicated
                            that he plans to discuss this proposalwith you during his visit next

                            planning to have preliminary talks with him and other members of his

                            fruitful.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> proposal springs, I
                            think, from the healthy feeling that Germany should itself make some
                            contribution toward bringing about reunification. At the same time, the
                            Germans fear that the United States might reach agreements with the
                            Soviet Union that would have the effect—intentionally or otherwise—of
                            consolidating the status quo, including the division of Germany. In
                            these circumstances we must be careful in dealing with any Germany
                            initiative not to contribute to that fear.</p>

                                    security provisions such as the denuclearization of Germany,
                                    withdrawal of foreign troops and bases, etc. If the Germans,
                                    therefore, wish to pursue their ideas they should comeupwith a
                                    complete plan which would show how they would plan to deal with

                                    victory of Western firmness in face of Soviet “power tactics”.

                                    solidarity. There has been wide recognition that stoppage of
                                    small US convoy is direct threat to Berlin and thus US
                                    maintenance of principle of free access is of vital importance
                                    to all Germans. No credence whatever given to <gloss

                        <p>Soviet blockings of Berlin autobahn convoys in the last month make it
                            useful to considercounteraction to vary the one-sided pattern of tension
                            and release by a demonstrationoftripartite or U.S. potential in similar
                            harassment of the Soviet Bloc.</p>
                        <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0650"/>
                        <p>Early opportunities for such counteraction will occur on 8 November and
                            11 November when Soviet freighters bound from Vladivostok to Montreal
                            are scheduled to begin transit of the Panama Canal. (An average of two
                            Soviet ships per month use the Canal.) By “administrative” and
                            “procedural” delays, which are subject to precise U.S. control, transit
                            of Soviet ships through the Canal could be delayed for periods well in
                            excess of delays of the last blocked U.S. convoy (about 42 hours).</p>
                        <p>There is a small-scale precedent for such counteractions in periodic
                            detainment by U.S. forces of Soviet vehicles in West Berlin in
                            retaliation for Soviet detainment of U.S.vehicles in East Berlin. On the
                            other hand, we have in the past avoided focussing on restricted
                            waterways in low-level countermeasures on grounds that the U.S. is so
                            dependent onfree maritime movement around the world. In this connection,
                            a year ago during the Cubancrisis, for both policy reasons and treaty
                            obligations, we defined the blockade line so as to exclude the Panama
                            Canal itself.</p>
                        <p>Since our objective is to signal that the proposed action is related to
                            autobahn harassments, the way in which we handle the matter with the
                            Soviets and publicly is a key element. The most appropriate alternatives
                            seem to be: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>To hope that the Soviets will make the connection by
                                    themselves and take no positive action to communicate our
                                    motive, except perhaps by making the period of detention
                                    identical with that of the convoy.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>To await a Soviet protest before allowing the ships to proceed
                                    and to then make an appropriate “unofficial” comment, while
                                    holding to the official explanation that the delays are purely
                                    administrative.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Which of these will govern will depend on the circumstances.</p>
                        <p>We think it unlikely that it will be necessary to leak the detention to
                            the press, particularly if the ship is [not?] detained very long.</p>
                        <p>Conceivable Soviet counters to our action might include, for example,
                            vigorous protests on interference with freedom of the seas, suggestions
                            that the friends of the USSR might restrict U.S. or allied freedom of
                            maritime movement elsewhere, furtherBerlin access delays, and no further
                            reduction of Soviet troop strength in Cuba.<note n="1" xml:id="d239fn1"

                        <p>The Department of State’s view of this countermeasure is that while it
                            offers usadvantages, there are also certain risks which we should be
                            aware of. The principal benefit of this action, in the Department’s
                            view, is that it would serve as a signal tothe Russians of our concern
                            about their actions on the autobahn. Furthermore, in contrastto our past
                            attempts to devise suitable countermeasures to Soviet harassment, which
                            wereinvariably frustrated by lack of appropriate options or
                            administrative problems, this measure represents a present opportunity
                            which can be carried out on quick notice by the U.S. side alone. (The
                            State Department does feel, however, that our French, British and German
                            Allies should be consulted, prior to implementation of this measure.) On
                            the otherhand, the State Department perceives the following
                            disadvantages: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The action involved is so far removed from the autobahn that
                                    it might be regarded by the Soviets as a sign of weakness. This
                                    could, however, be obviated, by continuing topursue a firm
                                    course of action on the autobahn.</item>

                                <item>The action represents a limited parallel, in view of the
                                    disproportionate use of the autobahn by the Allies and the Canal

                            one and a half hours. He was accompanied by Ambassadors <persName

                                corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>, and <persName

                                >Westrick</persName> was present on German side.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> opened the discussion after
                            the usual courtesies by saying that it was his desire to explore those
                            matters which the Chancellor wished to discuss in Washington. In
                            response to the Chancellor’s question, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> said that the first topic which we considered
                            important was to reach a common judgment on the situation in Eastern
                            Europe and the Soviet Union and a common policy line on the basis of
                            this judgment. It was clear that there was a rapid development of events
                            in the Communist bloc which presented us with both dangers and
                            opportunities.</p>
                        <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0653"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> agreed that the situation
                            was a changing one. He was under no illusion that large changes in
                            East-West relations were now feasible. However, he thought it important
                            to remain in contact with the Soviet Union, to continue conversations,
                            and to make such arrangements on smaller matters as would prove
                            possible. He was happy to observe that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> and the US share his view on the dangers of the
                            extension of long-term credits to the Soviets by the West. It was unwise
                            for us to help <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> build
                            up his long-run strength.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that the question of
                            credits was urgent. We have a fair basis for judging Soviet reserves of
                            gold and foreign exchange. We estimate that they will be paying some
                            $800 million to $1 billion for wheat purchases this year and next, and
                            we estimate their gold production at from $200 to $300 million per year.
                            The Soviets had obtained credits in the past which are now coming due,
                            and the amortization of these credits was about equal to the new credits
                            they are obtaining. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            has stated that the Soviets intend to spend some $3 billion a year over
                            seven years for chemical fertilizer plants. It was clear that their new
                            land venture has been a failure and that they are taking these steps to
                            solve their continuing agricultural problems. We estimate that about 40
                            per cent of this would be machinery and equipment, which they might try
                            to purchase abroad. This investment program posed difficult choices in
                            resource allocation and it seems certain that they will have to cut back
                            on military expenditures and possibly on troop strength. This should
                            dispose them to be more interested in measures of arms control and
                            possibly even disarmament. This situation of resource pressure could
                            also constitute a potential bargaining lever on political questions and
                            thus it was important for the West to achieve a common position on
                            long-term credits. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought
                            it would not be easy to achieve a common position on long-term credits
                            in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Italian position was
                            ambiguous, as was the Canadian; the UK appeared to desire to extend
                            long-term credits; and Norway would probably take the same position. He
                            said he would be seeing Mr. <persName>Heath</persName>
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d240fn2"><persName>Edward Heath</persName>, British
                                Lord Privy Seal.</note> and probably Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> in a few days and would discuss
                            the matter with them before it was taken up in the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> responded that he shared
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>’s estimate of the Soviet
                            situation. Trade alone would offer the Soviets very limited
                            opportunities, since they had little to supply to the West. Therefore,
                            credits were the central problem in Soviet economic relations with the
                            West. He also shared <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>’s
                            skepticism on the position of the UK. Germany, of course, would support
                            the US position very strongly. It was his judgment that France would
                            also support this position since it was consonant with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>’s general views on relations
                            with the Soviets. It was less clear <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632"
                                facs="0654"/>what the others would do. Germany thinks it equally
                            undesirable to extend long-term credits to the satellites, but does wish
                            to improve trade relations with them to change the somewhat rigid
                            position which had previously governed their relations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed in general, but
                            thought it useful to make a distinction between the Soviet Union and the
                            Eastern European countries. There was a growing divergence between these
                            countries and the Soviets which we should do our best to encourage. He
                            quoted <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s statement to
                            Harriman that the Soviet satellites were now too big to spank.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> asked whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would see improved trade
                            relations between Germany and Eastern European countries as hostile to
                            the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> responded that while
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would not be
                            particularly pleased, he could hardly object.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow extensive discussion of wheat prices and France’s role in
                            Europe.]</p>
                        <p>At <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>’s request, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> made some observations on the
                            Soviet situation.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor asked <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>
                            whether we had a reliable and full explanation of the Soviet motives in
                            blocking the convoys recently.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> thought that the impulse
                            had originated in the Soviet armed forces. It was clear to him that when
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was calling on the
                            President, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was ignorant
                            of what was happening on the Autobahn. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> would not have ordered an interruption at
                            that moment. If he had wished to have one, he would have done it earlier
                            or waited for <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                            return.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor observed that this might be a sufficient explanation for
                            the first incident, but asked how it bore on the second.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> pointed out
                            that once the prestige of the Soviet military was engaged, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had to support them. He
                            naturally desired to try to push us when he readily could, and he was
                            not free to ignore pressures from the army. These, of course, were
                            matters of conjecture; we could not speak with certainty on them. As for
                            the Soviet economic situation, it was clearly difficult but not
                            desperate. An increase in the supply of fertilizers alone would not
                            solve the agricultural problem. Present supplies are being wastefully
                            used, partly because of poor distribution and partly because of peasant
                            ignorance. The allocation of resources would continue to trouble the
                            Soviets, and while industrial output grew, agriculture would be a
                            problem for some time.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> asked two questions. First,
                            how strong was the embourgeoisement of the Soviet people; and second,
                            how deep were the differences between the Soviets and Communist
                            China.</p>
                        <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0655"/>
                        <p>On the first point, <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said
                            he thought this had gone very far indeed. He gave as examples the
                            inability of the government to suppress the artists and poets whom they
                            had criticized, the toleration by <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> of jazz to the point of his appearance at an
                            American concert, and the great interest of the ordinary citizen in
                            Western dress. Nonetheless, the Communist Party and not the people ran
                            the country, and the influence on policy of these changes in attitudes
                            was not clear. On the second question, <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                                >Thompson</persName> said that Soviet-Chinese conflict was
                            irreconcilable, as long as the present leadership ruled in the two
                            countries. The immediate question was how far the struggle would go in
                            the Communist Parties all over the world; whether there would be an open
                            break within these parties and their front organizations. As far as
                            state relations between the Soviets and Chinese went, he did not expect
                            a formal break, although continued frontier fighting conceivably could
                            lead even to this.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> inquired whether we had any
                            specific intelligence on military movements on the frontier.</p>

                            of military reinforcements on both sides and some rumors of fighting. It
                            was possible that fighting could take place without our knowing about

                            concessions in proper perspective. While there is a significant degree
                            of Soviet dependence on trade with <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634"
                                facs="0656"/>West which can be exploited by purposeful use of trade
                            to obtain indirect political benefits, I feel that idea of utilizing
                            trade deals to wrest political concessions of major importance from
                            Soviets is entirely false concept. We would delude ourselves if we
                            expected that Soviets would sacrifice what they regard as vital
                            political or security considerations for economic aid, regardless of how
                            difficult their economic situation may appear to be.</p>
                        <p>While thus disagreeing with underlying concept, I believe it might well
                            be useful to encourage Germans to consult in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                        <p>President Luebke said the German delegation was extremely grateful for
                            this opportunity to meet with President <persName>Johnson</persName>. It
                            was obviously impossible under the circumstances to have the full
                            exchange of views which had been contemplated when the <persName
                                corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> visit was scheduled, but he
                            wished to mention briefly a few German national problems. First, we had
                            to recognize that there were indications there might be some new attacks
                            on the communications lines between the Federal Republic and Berlin, and
                            this situation would bear watching. There were several other pending
                            problems which had already been discussed,<note n="2" xml:id="d242fn2">A
                                memorandum of the conversation at the Department of State at 2:30

                                Memoranda of Conversation: Lot 65 D 330.</note> and there was no
                            need to repeat the German position here. It would be important for the
                            German people to be reassured that the US attitude on all these matters
                            remained unchanged. Luebke was convinced personally that our two
                            governments were agreed on fundamentals and that there were no basic
                            problems between us.</p>
                        <p>The President said he heartily concurred with this view. He wanted at the
                            outset to express his appreciation to the German delegation for honoring
                            us with their presence on this occasion. He was glad that the President,
                            the Chancellor and others could be with us in this sad hour to show
                            their respect for our late President.</p>
                        <p>President Luebke replied that it was entirely understandable that the
                            Germans should wish to express their sympathy. The Germans had received
                            so much support from the US that they wished to stand together with us
                            in this tragic hour. The reason the Germans had been able to build up
                            their country again was largely due to American help. They wished to
                            continue to work together with us. He mentioned in particular the matter
                            of aid to underdeveloped countries.</p>
                        <p>The President said this attitude was very much appreciated.</p>
                        <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> commented that he
                            had already been scheduled to be here with Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>, although under entirely
                            different <pb n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0658"/>circumstances. The
                            German objective had been to redefine and strengthen the relationship
                            between our two countries following <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Erhard</persName>’s taking over the chancellorship. It would have
                            been a good time to do so after his visit with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> in Paris. There were common
                            problems facing us he had wished to discuss—the Atlantic Alliance,
                            European integration and the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> Round, among others. Now, after the tragic death
                            of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>, he felt
                            there was a need to give new impetus to all the objectives we shared
                            together. We should avoid the impression there was any kind of hiatus.
                            He was therefore anxious to have these talks as soon as possible, maybe
                            in early January. After that he would have to go to London on an
                            official visit. He reiterated there was a real need to give a new
                            impulse to Atlantic cooperation and to show the peoples of Europe that
                            there would be no interruption in the progress toward our
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that we were anxious to reschedule the <persName
                                corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> visit as soon as possible. He
                            would ask the State Department to look over the schedule and see what
                            specific dates could be worked out. Since <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Erhard</persName> had been scheduled to be here right now, the
                            President would want him to be the first, or at least one of the first
                            on the list. Meanwhile, there were many decisions which had to be made
                            by the new American Government. He was going before a joint session of
                            the Congress tomorrow morning and developments in Congress might have
                            some effect on his own schedule. But he agreed that the visit should
                            take place and take place soon. He was fully aware of the value of our
                            relations with the Federal Republic. We appreciated the Federal
                            Republic’s support in the causes of Atlantic partnership and European
                            unity. We shared a number of things in common. For example, his own
                            mother’s family had come to America from Germany in 1848. Both he and
                                <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> were starting new
                            administrations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> replied that he was aware
                            that President <persName>Johnson</persName> knew Germany. He had gone to
                            Berlin at an historic hour after the Wall was erected in August, 1961.
                            He was happy to hear that the President was of German ancestry and
                            commented that 1848 was the year the best Germans had left Germany for
                            the US. He felt the transition we were now undergoing both in Germany
                            and in the US should be a smooth one. We had a basic identity of
                            viewpoint, and Germany had the fullest confidence both in the US and in
                            President <persName>Johnson</persName> personally.</p>
                        <p>The President replied it was comforting to hear these sentiments. There
                            were several points he wished to make: We were determined to preserve
                            our rights in Berlin; as he had himself said in Berlin, we intended to
                            stay there.<note n="3" xml:id="d242fn3">add “as long as our presence was
                                required.” [Footnote in the source text added at a later
                                time.]</note> We would keep the military forces in Europe necessary
                                <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0659"/>to meet our commitments. We
                            supported the right of the German people to self-determination. The
                            President looked forward to working together with the new Chancellor and
                            the German people. He also looked to <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Erhard</persName> as a famous economist and a leading advocate of
                            expansion of world trade to make the coming trade negotiations a
                            success. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> had
                            “put everything on the line” for the Trade Expansion Act. The President
                            considered TEA as one of the outstanding achievements of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Administration in the search
                            for world peace. While he did not want to relieve Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> of his responsibility as our
                            expert in this field, the President would also look to Chancellor
                                <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> to help make these
                            talks next spring successful. He had just himself returned from the
                            Benelux countries and knew that everyone there was very concerned over
                            the outcome of the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> should know that if
                            possible President <persName>Johnson</persName> felt even stronger on
                            this subject than had President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName>. It was imperative to have a flow of goods if we
                            were to have a flow of understanding.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> replied that on the German
                            side they would do their best to make the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> Round a success. They were aware of the need of
                            the peoples of Europe and America to feel that they formed a unity,
                            quite apart from military or political considerations, in their everyday
                            life. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> recalled that he had
                            been with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> when
                            the trade expansion bill had been sent to the Hill and that he had also
                            been there when the bill had been passed. He therefore had a personal
                            interest in the success of the Act. It would not be easy within the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> to negotiate the agricultural
                            problem, which had a definite relationship to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round. The matter of grain
                            prices was a particularly difficult problem. President Luebke, Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and he were all
                            agreed that they must move ahead in Germany on these matters and that
                            changes would be needed. He was happy to learn that President
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> attached such importance to this
                            problem. While in Paris he had also discussed the question of
                            disparities with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, who
                            wanted to eliminate this problem. <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Erhard</persName> felt that it was not possible to settle these
                            problems individually and in isolation, but that they should all be
                            considered together.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that other common ground he shared with the
                            Germans was that there was a large German population in Texas and that
                            the American Ambassador to Germany was from Texas. In connection with
                            agricultural problems he recalled an incident recently in Texas where
                            large quantities of chicken salad had been bought by the Governor with
                            funds which were not authorized. The ensuing difficulties had had a very
                            divisive effect in Texas and the injuries from the chicken salad case
                            were still with us. He looked to Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Erhard</persName> to see to it that a few little chickens would not
                            cause similar enduring difficulties between the US and Germany.</p>
                        <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0660"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented that he hoped
                            we could finally settle this problem.</p>
                        <p>The President then inquired as to what time in January or early February
                            might be best for an <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> visit.
                            He pointed out we would be faced with a number of problems in early
                            January—Congress would be reconvening, there was the State of the Union
                            message, the Budget message, and so on.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked when <persName
                                corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> was going to London. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> replied January 15–16, adding
                            that it would be highly desirable if he could visit here before going to
                            London.</p>
                        <p>The President said we were anxious to settle this point in accordance
                            with the Chancellor’s wishes and asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> to try within the next few days to work out a
                            date.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> asked what he should say to
                            the press after the meeting should they inquire about this point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested he state that
                            it had been agreed the visit should be rescheduled at the earliest
                            possible time. He could indicate that this meant as soon as possible
                            after January 1. We would try to work this out within the next day or
                            so.</p>
                        <p>President Luebke said another factor in favor of early January was that
                            later in the month they would be holding a big agricultural fair (Green
                            Week) in Berlin. There would be many agricultural experts there and it
                            would be good if some of the agricultural problems could be worked out
                            prior to the meeting.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said that from the
                            standpoint of “atmosphere” it would be highly desirable if it could be
                            made absolutely clear that there would be continuity of US policy. It
                            was also important to demonstrate that personal contact had been
                            established between the two administrations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he could give
                            complete assurances regarding the continuity of US policy and our desire
                            to continue to work very closely with the Germans toward our common
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>The President said he wished to stress that he had been a part of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Administration and
                            had personally taken part in shaping its policy. He was deeply committed
                            to its objectives. On the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                            visit the Chancellor could say to the press that we regretted the tragic
                            circumstances requiring the postponement of the visit and that we would
                            reschedule it shortly after January 1.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if there were any further comments. President Luebke
                            said there was one additional item on his mind. He had recently come
                            back from a trip to Iran, Indonesia, Japan and the Philippines. He had
                            been particularly struck by the problems in Indonesia, a country of 100
                            million people but in very poor shape economically. It was this latter
                            factor which tended to push the government and people of Indonesia <pb
                                n="639" xml:id="pg_639" facs="0661"/>toward Moscow. He was convinced
                            it was necessary for all of us in the free world to hold Indonesia. He
                            believed Sukarno had no personal tendency toward Moscow and would go in
                            that direction only if there were no alternative. He himself had not
                            particularly wanted to go to Indonesia to start with but had asked the
                            British and Americans for advice. Both had said he should go, and he was
                            glad he had done so. He wanted to stress that Sukarno was ready to
                            establish closer ties with the West than with the East bloc. He felt
                            that the decision of the US Senate on foreign aid was a factor of great
                            importance in this picture. He therefore hoped the President would give
                            his personal attention to this problem.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that he was aware of this problem and appreciated
                            President Luebke’s interest. He assured him that his views would be
                            taken into account.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, President Luebke said he had been gratified to hear what
                            had been said about the continuity of US policy. He wanted to thank the
                            President for these statements.</p>

                        <p>The British have been having some high-level bilateral exchanges with the
                            Soviets, on the relation between a non-aggression pact and the
                            Berlin-Germany problem, and it is time now for us to weigh in with them.
                            Here is the situation and <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>’s
                            recommendation, in which I concur:</p>
                        <p>The Germans have violently opposed a non-aggression pact which did not
                            bring real improvement in Berlin or Germany. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> has now suggested to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Douglas</persName> Home that a non-aggression
                            pact might be accompanied by a unilateral Soviet declaration opposing
                            the use of such force for such problems as Germany and West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>This is not nearly enough for the Germans or for us, and the UK has
                            suggested that they might propose an amendment which would require the
                            Soviet Union to state that it would refrain from any unilateral action
                            affecting the situation in Berlin or Western access to that city.</p>

                        <p>We think this is not good enough, plainly because it would be regarded as
                            weakness in Germany and because British bargaining in particular arouses
                            suspicion on the Continent.</p>
                        <p>So our plan is to tell the British that we prefer to have them fend off
                            this Soviet ploy (which is all it seems to be right now) but that if
                            they insist on going forward, they ought to check directly with the
                            French and the Germans, rather than to put the matter in the North
                            Atlantic Council.</p>
                        <p>I have watched this one carefully, because the Department tends to be
                            more rigid on these matters than President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> wanted, but in this case their recommendation

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> opened
                            the discussion by saying that he would like to discuss Berlin and
                            Germany. He said that the Soviets had made it clear that they are not
                            prepared to include Berlin and Germany in a detente. Recent incidents on
                            the autobahn and statements by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> made
                            this clear. The Soviet Union instead demanded a peace treaty and a free
                            West Berlin. The aim of the Soviet Union <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643"
                                facs="0665"/>was to separate Germany from the Alliance. Recently
                            Pankow (the headquarters of the East German regime) was increasing its
                            agitation. An example was the question of Christmas passes. This
                            apparently is the beginning of a ten point plan. The East Germans have
                            not made clear what the other points are but the passes are a beginning
                            which are supposed to run over ten points.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> then turned to the points
                            under discussion between the East and West. He noted that all considered
                            the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> proposal for a
                            declaration on Berlin in connection with a nonaggression arrangement
                            unsatisfactory. The Federal Republic believed that a nonaggression
                            arrangement should be the end of a process not the beginning. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said he did not want to go
                            into detail about the question of observation posts. He did wish to
                            note, however, that Soviet opposition to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1"
                                >MLF</gloss> in connection with nondiffusion is instructive. Germany
                            believes that any further comments on nondiffusion should only be made
                            after an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> has been achieved.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> then said he wanted
                            to raise the question of whether there is a requirement for a Western
                            initiative on Germany. He then reviewed the history of the revised Peace
                            Plan in the Ambassadorial Group and the general contents of the revised
                            Peace Plan. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> then
                            referred to the proposal on Germany prepared by the Kuratorium on
                            Indivisible Germany.<note n="2" xml:id="d245fn2">On June 23 the
                                Kuratorium “Unteilbares Deutschland” had sent President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> a memorandum on the future
                                of German unity. For text, see <hi rend="italic">Dokumente zur

                                For text, see ibid., pp. 709–710. The proposals were subsequently
                                distributed to the three Western Foreign Ministers during the U.N.
                                General Assembly session in New York in October.</note><persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said he did not want to commit
                            himself to any or all of this proposal at this time but would like to
                            introduce it for discussion. He felt we should at least prepare a
                            Western initiative in the event it should be necessary to offset an
                            initiative from the East.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> said that as he
                            understood it, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>
                            wanted in effect to prepare a new peace plan which presented the case
                            for the unification of Germany.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> again reviewed the
                            history of this question. He said it had been discussed last year at the
                            working dinner in Paris, that the Ambassadorial Group had sought to
                            reach agreement on a revised Peace Plan but were not successful. In
                            August the Germans raised the question again.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>’s remark raised three
                            questions: is it a good idea to have a new peace plan; should such a
                            peace plan stress East-West German contacts or Four-Power
                            responsibility; and finally what would we do with the peace plan when it
                            was finished? He said he <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0666"/>found
                            no harm in preparing a new peace plan and was agreeable to the
                            Ambassadorial Group working on it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> remarked that he
                            found <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>’s suggestion
                            attractive. He felt that the West is not sufficiently active in
                            presenting our solution to the German question. He did not know whether
                            we would make any progress but we should do preparatory work. Any study
                            should examine the question of German reunification and European
                            security. Economic concessions might contribute to a powerful package.
                            Conceivably we might offer a package which would engage Soviet
                            interests. The Secretary said that we have two objectives: German
                            unification and to get the 22 divisions out of East Germany. It was
                            possible that the Ambassadorial Group might be able to prepare a fresh
                            approach. He welcomed, therefore, the German proposal.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> said we have previously
                            been studying the peripheral issues. These questions were becoming
                            tedious. He remarked he had only handled them two months and was already
                            tired of them. In his reply to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> the British Prime Minister will take care of
                            the question of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and will make it
                            clear that the Soviet position is completely unsatisfactory. There was,
                            however, some possibility of progress on observation posts, although
                            there was the unacceptable link to troop withdrawal. With regard to a
                            nonaggression arrangement, the reply will say nothing but that the
                            British are discussing the subject with their Allies. It looked
                            therefore as though it would be difficult to make progress with
                            peripheral issues, with the possible exception of observation posts, at
                            Geneva. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> said it was
                            agreeable with him for the Ambassadorial Group to examine the German
                            proposals. He then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> what economic inducements he had in mind.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> referred, in reply, to
                            proposals for an increase in swing (or credit) within the context of the
                            Interzonal Trade Agreement. The East Germans are however sensitive to
                            political conditions. Perhaps if economic concessions were advanced
                            within a Four-Power group, the Soviet interests could be mobilized.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> was quite certain that if a secret ballot were
                            held in East Germany, the East Germans would vote for reunification.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said this was the
                            risk the West Germans must run if they believe in self-determination.
                            They are however confident that the results would be favorable. This was
                            the reason the Soviets opposed a plebiscite.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            had said that in 1953 Malenkov and Beria had wanted to get rid of East
                            Germany. We should now look to see if there are factors more important
                            to the Soviets than 17 million Germans. If a few people in the Soviet
                            hierarchy had wanted to get rid of East Germany, there might be more
                            now.</p>
                        <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0667"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> remarked that in a trade
                            agreement with the East the satellites have accepted their application
                            to Berlin, although this is not liked by the Soviets or the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> present his proposal to the Ambassadorial
                            Group.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> asked when this might
                            happen.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said it was hard to say.
                            We must prepare against the possibility that the Soviets might take some
                            initiative and we would need to counter it. Or the Soviets might leave
                            some opening in which we would consider it desirable to take an
                            initiative.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stressed that it was important that there be no press
                            speculation on this, but that the work proceed quickly in the
                            Ambassadorial Group. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> said
                            it would spoil the effect if there were press speculation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said that a number of new
                            ideas were coming from German parliamentary circles. The group known as
                            Indivisible Germany represents a group of leading West Germans. It was
                            necessary to be able to say that their proposals were being submitted to
                            the Ambassadorial Group, which has the problem of Germany under constant
                            review. It would, however, not be necessary to give any more details. He
                            agreed there would be no reference to the discussion this evening, but
                            he would say we are referring any proposals to the Ambassadorial
                            Group.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked when public pressure was likely to arise.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> replied it existed
                            already. The Bundestag debate on the Test Ban Treaty might raise the
                            question of a West German initiative. The cabinet had taken no decision
                            but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> thought the
                            treaty would not come up for debate before March.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded the discussion of this subject by saying that the
                            four Foreign Ministers had agreed to examining the German proposals
                            after Christmas.</p>
                        <p rend="center">CHRISTMAS PASSES</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> began the discussion by
                            reviewing the history of the Christmas pass question. The Secretary said
                            that he hoped that some arrangement could be worked out regarding
                            Christmas passes on humanitarian grounds. With regard to the question of
                            channels of communication, he asked if there were any alternatives such
                            as the Red Cross or the Commandants. <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Carstens</persName> said that the various alternatives had been
                            considered but for various reasons dismissed. Krapf raised the question
                            of how to handle this with the press. The Secretary suggested saying
                            that it had been agreed that it would be desirable on humanitarian
                            grounds to work out an arrangement and that it was hoped the East would
                            not place political obstacles in the way.</p>
                        <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0668"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said that this question
                            of visiting families had arisen on the two previous Christmases. The
                            East chose Christmas to make their proposals in order to bring pressure
                            to bear on the West Berliners. He thought the East German press
                            conference had been a shrewd move. If we accepted Eastern terms we would
                            weaken the West’s position. On the other hand, it would not appear there
                            was much we could do.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked if some technical agencies could handle the
                            passes and thus avoid political issues. <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> said the other side was prepared to use postal
                            personnel. The decisive point is whether there will be an agreement
                            between the West Berlin Government and the East German regime. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> added that the East wanted
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> or his representative
                            with full powers to sign.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said that no matter how the
                            agreement was reached it would tend to weaken the position of West
                            Berlin. There was then some discussion of the various levels at which an
                            agreement might be concluded.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that if the agreement failed, there might be serious
                            tensions in West Berlin and this was of concern to the occupation
                            powers. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said that the
                            West Berliners had often been disappointed. The Secretary concluded the
                            discussion by saying he hoped we would hear more of the pass issue in
                            the coming days and that something could be worked out without loss of
                            morale in West Berlin.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> said he would like to see
                            placed in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué a
                            non-aggression statement and wondered if <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> had any objection to this. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said that the British formula
                            emphasized Germany too much but might be acceptable if it were shortened
                            and move general. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> remarked
                            they might shorten it two or three sentences. <persName corresp="#p_SG3"

                            treated in isolation were so obdurate that it was necessary to think
                            through again the possibility of making some progress in solving the
                            central problems.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> replied that the quadripartite

                                    >Document 245</ref>.</note> had produced a new sense of
                            initiative on the German side—a new willingness to look with a more open
                            mind at the possibility of developing a comprehensive Western position
                            on Germany-Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>
                            showed a new approach, a new mobility or at least a disposition to move
                            on the German problem if possible. An example of a new and more flexible
                            mood in Germany was a paper prepared by Unteilbares Deutschland.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d246fn2">See <ref target="#d245fn2">footnote 2,
                                    Document 245</ref>.</note> This had emphasized the possibility
                            of converting economic advantages for Eastern Europe into political
                            concessions for the West. Although the US was sceptical about the extent
                            to which this was possible German ideas were worth exploring. But in
                            dealing with German reunification one must limit oneself to the
                            reunification of the Federal Republic and the German Democratic
                            Republic. West Germany had tried to keep open the possibility of
                            including territory east of the Oder-Neisse line but this was
                            unrealistic. Hitler had closed that door. Also in thinking in terms of
                            proposals for German reunification one must bear in mind the elements
                                <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0670"/>of interest to the USSR.
                            Such a settlement if negotiated on satisfactory terms would free the
                            USSR from two burdens: (1) the fear of German revanchism; and (2) the
                            need to keep 22 Soviet divisions stationed abroad. He personally favored
                            asking the ambassadorial group to go back to the drawing board taking
                            German proposals as the basis for its work and examining any package
                            proposal in the light of what would make it worth while to the USSR to
                            give up 17 million Germans. This is particularly opportune time for such
                            a review because in the present international atmosphere the USSR may
                            throw at us sweeping proposals to which we must be prepared to make
                            counter proposals. We should encourage the Germans to come forward with
                            the initial proposals and see whether we can build on them if we need
                            to. We should aim at a comprehensive approach including political,
                            military, economic and humanitarian elements. There were numerous
                            possibilities—for example the possibility of examining various formulas
                            for a Mixed Commission comprising the 4 occupying powers and the East
                            and West Germans.</p>

                            with German officials in Paris on this general subject.<note n="3"

                            present a fuller and more complete plan in the near future—probably in
                            early January (between the 10th and 15th) after the <persName
                                corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> visit to the US. Their general
                            thinking seemed to be running along the lines of the proposals of
                            Unteilbares Deutschland. But although <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> was glad to have the general support of this
                            influential body he did not want to seem to take over the plans without
                            modification. He wanted the German proposal to bear the stamp of the
                            Foreign Office and to give the <persName corresp="#p_SK4"
                                >Schuetz</persName> proposals a sharper edge. The Foreign Office was
                            not enthusiastic about all features of the <persName corresp="#p_SK4"
                                >Schuetz</persName> plan. They were not convinced that the Four
                            Power Commission should be authorized to work on a peace treaty. They
                            wished to think more carefully about the implications of East and West
                            Germans being associated with the Commission and measure very carefully
                            the consequences of such an arrangement on the standing of East and West
                            Germany. But they did consider there were certain measures which could
                            be taken immediately: such as (1) establishment of a commission for
                            humanitarian measures; (2) a commission for political amnesty; (3) a
                            commission for freedom of movement and (4) a commission for economic
                            concessions. The Germans had been greatly interested in the East German
                            hint that the agreement on Christmas passes was the first of ten steps
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would propose. The German FO
                            thought that the next steps might involve greater movement of persons,
                            broadening of categories, extension of time limits, etc. But the East
                            German negotiator Wendt had not spelt out what he had in mind. <pb
                                n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0671"/>All this had made the West
                            Germans believe that the time may come in the not too distant future
                            when the East Germans may come up with what has the appearance of a big
                            offer, although it will probably include elements which will enhance the
                            standing of the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>. The higher level in
                            the German Foreign Office believes pressures are building up on the East
                            German regime which they cannot ignore. The existence of the Wall is
                            having an adverse effect on the standing of East Germany in the eyes of
                            other Eastern European countries. The rigidity of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> regime is embarrassing and is
                            making East Germany vulnerable. Even the USSR is becoming critical of
                            it. This island of Stalinism on the western edge of the Soviet world
                            which is becoming more moderate stands out like a sore thumb. Within
                            East Germany itself this situation is creating difficulties. The rank
                            and file of party workers are finding it difficult to explain the
                            policies of the <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> regime
                            compared to what is happening in a country like Czechoslovakia. Even the
                            Russians reportedly told <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>
                            that he should look more human. An illustration of the contrast between
                            East Germany and the rest of Eastern Europe is the relaxation of travel
                            measures in Czechoslovakia. East and West Germans are now flocking to
                            Prague to meet. Another example of the new spirit is the campaign of
                            highly placed Czech officials to encourage West Germans to spend their
                            vacation in Eastern Europe.</p>

                            favored <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>’s policy of

                            somewhat less rigid on some of the perennial problems. We should be
                            prepared to encourage the Germans to explore possibilities and give them
                            their head. He had the impression that <persName corresp="#p_SG3"

                        <p><persName>Peter Thomas</persName> (British Minister of State) said he
                            could not see that <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> had
                            really gone beyond the 1959 Peace Plan except for the introduction of
                            economic inducements. He agreed that the situation would be changed if
                            the Germans agreed to recognize the Oder-Neisse line and the present
                            Czech border. The fears of Poland and Czechoslovakia were real and if
                            they were reassured this would introduce a new and significant element
                            into the East-West equation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName> pointed out that when proposals were made for an
                            East German-West German plebiscite—as was made in the German
                            proposals—this was on the basis of the <gloss target="#t_FEDREP1"
                                >FedRep</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. This
                            strengthened the idea that we were not talking about the territory east
                            of the Oder-Neisse line. He added that the fact that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> had argued that <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>’s pressing for the <gloss
                                target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> indicated German revanchist ambitions
                            against Poland and Czechoslovakia showed that these fears existed in the
                            USSR as well as in <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0672"/>Poland and
                            Czechoslovakia. German renunciation of these frontiers as part of a
                            package would give a Western peace plan a new sweep. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FTK1">Thomas</persName> admitted this would make a
                            difference.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said when <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> in November had emphasized
                            reunification, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had pointed
                            out to him this emphasis would have the result of smoking out the West
                            on the question of what was to be reunified. He added that there seemed
                            to be new possibilities opening up. The fact that Poland and
                            Czechoslovakia showed greater independence and possibly exercised
                            greater influence in the Communist system might make a difference.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> said that if the Germans
                            wished to make an initiative they would have to give their proposals
                            more scope. He had been disappointed in his talk with <persName
                                corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> in Bonn to find that <persName
                                corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> was thinking in terms of economic
                            initiatives towards the Eastern satellites and of increasing interzonal
                            trade but not of economic inducements for Russia. He was not optimistic
                            about getting <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> to move. He
                            described him as a marmoset of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s. <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> was much more forthcoming at the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> quadrilateral conversation than he
                            was when <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> talked to him in
                            Bonn. He must have held back to save his ammunition for the
                            quadripartite talks. Possibly he had been encouraged by the effects of
                            greater German trade with Eastern Europe. The Berlin Christmas pass
                            development had shown that the German Government could not turn down
                            humanitarian opportunities on purely theoretical grounds. (It was
                            estimated that between 400,000 and 750,000 might cross the Wall at
                            Christmas. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> said the
                            Commandants were considering security implications that might arise from
                            this development.)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> asked what was the American
                            thinking about how all this tied in with disarmament. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said one had to think in alternate
                            terms—in terms of two possible tracks which might be followed. A German
                            plebiscite might result in unification or in the acceptance of division.
                            Which of these courses was chosen would determine how other factors
                            would be handled. There were possibilities for disarmament which must be
                            examined. There were possibilities of reductions of forces and of
                            guarantees against concentrations of forces and surprise attack.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> also expressed the view
                            that Germans may go on to think of possibilities of economic
                            arrangements to be extended to the USSR as an inducement for a German
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> emphasized the danger of
                            putting forward proposals which might cast doubt on the idea of an
                            all-German government. The Western Allies had always insisted that a
                            German settlement must be negotiated by a free all-German Government.
                            This was essential to the German position. The West must make it
                            absolutely clear to the Soviet Government that this point is
                            non-negotiable. Unless this position is maintained the whole German
                            support would crumble. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>
                            so far had maintained <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0673"/>that the
                            renunciation of the Oder-Neisse line could only be made by a Pan-German
                            Government. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> had made this clear to him.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> said the traditional
                            position to which the West was pledged in the 1954 and other agreements
                            was that German boundaries must be determined at a peace conference.</p>
                        <p>Wilson (British) doubted that an offer about the Oder-Neisse line would
                            be very impressive since the West had renounced the use of force. Caccia
                            replied that this point may seem like a fly-blown card to us but it did
                            not look that way to Poles and Czechs. They would attach great
                            importance to this. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested
                            that Poles and Czechs might put pressure on the USSR. Furthermore they
                            might welcome an agreement which would get them out of the present
                            target system within which they now fell.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> commented an
                            Oder-Neisse line offer would have been much more impressive if it had
                            been made some years ago. Our bargaining power deriving from this point
                            is now less. We should also be fully aware of the political implications
                            of this issue. There were a large number of émigrés in Germany from the
                            eastern territories. The Chancellor had neutralized this vote by his
                            policy of western development which had made it possible to absorb these
                            groups but if there was a depression they would reemerge as a political
                            force of formidable proportions. They would be among the first to feel
                            the effects of unemployment. They would be quick to protest that their
                            prescriptive rights had been sold down the river. If this question were
                            treated in isolation it would be difficult and German politicians would
                            be leery of it. If it formed part of an attractive comprehensive package
                            which seemed to have a good chance of being achieved the situation would
                            be quite different.</p>

                                        improve the position of the people of East Germany and the

                        <p>I think this last point is essential. In the end this is an issue for
                            Heads of Government, and if you and <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Erhard</persName> have confidence in each other on fundamentals,

                            welcome, although there is always a danger that the Germans will go

                        <p>After an exchange of pleasantries and some discussion of local history,
                            the President told the Chancellor of the close relationship which the
                            American people felt for the German people, and added that he was <pb
                                n="654" xml:id="pg_654" facs="0676"/>especially pleased this meeting
                            could take place so early in both their administrations.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor was grateful for the personal privilege of meeting with
                            the President in this private atmosphere. He noted, too, there were no
                            serious problems between the US and Germany.</p>
                        <p>The President said the US wanted to draw the curtain over the past, work
                            side by side, and try to live peacefully together with the other peoples
                            of this planet. This was a major challenge. Despite the great progress
                            in the physical sciences, comparable progress had not been made in
                            political science, in the science of people learning to live peacefully
                            together.</p>
                        <p>The President reminded the Chancellor that US commitments to the Federal
                            Republic and Berlin were far reaching. He then went on to say he
                            considered the Chancellor one of the ablest world leaders and therefore
                            looked to the Chancellor for suggestions for improving the Atlantic
                            partnership and reducing East-West tensions. He especially hoped that
                            during these two days of talks, he and the Chancellor would succeed in
                            pinpointing possible new approaches for dealing with some of the major
                            problems facing both their countries.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the talk, the President told the Chancellor he felt
                            the conversations had been fruitful and helpful. He reassured the
                            Chancellor of the US trust and confidence in him and promised that he
                            could rely fully on US faith and trust.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said he appreciated this. He hoped their exchanges would
                            always be candid and full. Even though his comments might sometimes not
                            be diplomatic, the President could always be sure they were honest and
                            straightforward.</p>
                        <p>The President said he preferred this kind of relationship. He, too, did
                            not want to get bogged down in striped pants diplomacy. It was most
                            important that the two of them understand and trust one another and
                            maintain the closest possible working relationship.</p>

                        <p>The Chancellor said that among the most difficult issues facing the
                            Western allies were the questions of European integration and the
                            Atlantic partnership. Unless economic integration was accompanied by
                            some kind of political integration, Europe would remain a collection of
                            separate and different states. In this connection, the Chancellor’s
                            greatest concern was President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>. The Federal Republic was pleased with the
                            reconciliation between the German and French peoples. But the
                            relationship established by Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>—and the Chancellor emphasized that he did not mean
                            to be critical of Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName>—was almost wholly emotional and sentimental and
                            lacked a solid political base. The viewpoints of the two partners were
                            never clearly and candidly stated. This could not continue. Moreover,
                            things were different now. At the recent negotiations in Brussels, for
                            example, the German representatives stood their ground firmly so that
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would
                            understand the German view. As far as the Chancellor is concerned, a
                            healthy relationship between states cannot be based wholly on sentiment.
                            Account must be taken of the partners’ vital interests and world
                            commitments. And in the case of Germany, there was the special problem
                            of living down a historical past, demonstrating that it had purged
                            itself of moral guilt and that it intended to contribute constructively
                            to the cause of freedom and world peace.</p>
                        <p>Replying, the President said he personally admired <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and would try to work with
                            him. He did not think the differences between the US and France were
                            irreconcilable. However, he would welcome any suggestions the Chancellor
                            might have on ways for improving relations between the US and
                            France.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said he did not want to be misunderstood. The German
                            people were happy with the reconciliation with France. European
                            integration would not have been possible if France and Germany did <pb
                                n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0678"/>not get together. In fact, in
                            his talks in Paris<note n="1" xml:id="d249fn1"><persName

                                21–22.</note> the Chancellor reminded President <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> of this as well as the need
                            for strengthening the Atlantic partnership. But <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> obviously looked at the
                            problem differently. He insisted he was a strong supporter of the
                            Western alliance and demonstrated this during the Cuban crisis and the
                            recent Berlin autobahn incidents. But while France was for the Western
                            alliance, it considered <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> less than
                            a perfect instrument. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> simply was
                            not the French way of doing things. France therefore had to have its own
                            force de frappe. Germany, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> reassured the Chancellor, had every right to rely
                            on the US for nuclear protection. France, however, wanted to stand on
                            its own two feet. According to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>, the present defense arrangements were inadequate.
                            Therefore, although remaining faithful to the Western alliance, France
                            had to take measures for its own defense. As for specific proposals to
                            revamp <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> indicated he had none. The
                            General merely asserted that he did not want to cling to old concepts.
                            (Interestingly enough, in the Chancellor’s view, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> did not even revert to his
                            tripartite directorate proposal.)</p>
                        <p>Describing his reply to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>,
                            the Chancellor said he told the French President he could support
                            France’s view on the force de frappe. He could understand, too, France’s
                            desire not to commit forces to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.
                            (The Chancellor said he even volunteered the information that the US
                            probably felt the same way.) But the Chancellor said he also told the
                            General that France’s attempt to use the veto to prevent military
                            integration through <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was totally
                            incomprehensible.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor suggested the President might take this very same line
                            when he met <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>—a meeting
                            which he felt had to take place sooner or later. It clearly was not
                            possible to talk <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> out of
                            his force de frappe or his determination to keep his national forces out
                            of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. However, the Chancellor felt
                            strongly that the President had to make clear to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> that he would not tolerate
                            obstacles to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s development. Such
                            actions are contagious. And the fact is that if France played a more
                            positive role in Europe, the other European partners would perform
                            better.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor asserted there was a serious malaise in Europe. Britain
                            was unsure of herself on the eve of new elections. (The Chancellor added
                            that personally and confidentially he would like to see the
                            Conservatives win.) The smaller nations were disgruntled. The Benelux
                            countries felt they were being treated as second-class nations. And the
                                <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> countries thought they were
                            being discriminated against by the Common Market. This was a matter of
                            concern to the Federal Republic. New life blood was needed for the
                            concept of Europe. However, the <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0679"
                            />Chancellor felt no significant progress was possible until the
                            question of the markets was settled. That was why the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round was so important. Europe
                            could not afford to isolate itself. It had to keep its ties with the
                            outside world and maintain close relations with the US. The difficulty
                            was that national interests differed. France seemed to be moving in a
                            protectionist direction. Germany, on the other hand, which has 30
                            percent of its gross national product tied up in foreign trade, looked
                            to the outside world for its prosperity, and needed an outward-looking
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor promised to do his part to try to hold the European
                            nations together. But a political underpinning was needed. The
                            Chancellor said he talked with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> about this, but the General showed no enthusiasm
                            for the subject. However, the Chancellor believes <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is more favorably inclined to
                            political integration than is apparent. And if this is true, prospects
                            for an Atlantic partnership are probably good. Because of the importance
                            the Chancellor attaches to the problem, he intends to see General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> again soon; go to
                            London in mid-January; and to Rome at the end of the month.</p>
                        <p>As for <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> personally, the
                            Chancellor admitted great respect for him. He thought he was reasonable
                            and understanding. When they met in Paris, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1"
                                >De Gaulle</persName> told the Chancellor that if he were in his
                            place he would follow the same policy toward the US that the Federal
                            Republic was pursuing. He also said he would never force Germany to
                            choose between France and the US.</p>
                        <p>Having said all this, however, the Chancellor went on to characterize
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>’s views and
                            policies as rigid. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> he
                            said insisted that any aggression from the East, even if only a border
                            incident, had to be countered not with conventional but with nuclear
                            weapons. The General was also adamantly opposed to any discussions with
                            the Soviets on a possible modus vivendi.</p>
                        <p>The German position, however, the Chancellor assured the President was
                            more like that of the US. The Germans had no illusions about peace
                            breaking out all over or people suddenly embracing one another. But the
                            Germans felt strongly that the likelihood of hot war had to be pushed as
                            far away as possible.</p>
                        <p>The basic problem with France, the Chancellor went on to say, is that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has no faith in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He also overestimates the
                            effectiveness of his force de frappe. He wants France to go her own way
                            and insists France must have enough nuclear weapons to destroy the
                            Soviet Union at once. General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> is not impressed with the fact that the Soviet
                            Union can destroy France ten times over. His answer is that this really
                            makes no difference, for people can die but once. The Chancellor <pb
                                n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0680"/>said he tried to argue this
                            point with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> but did not
                            think he succeeded in changing the General’s views one iota.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said he did not know how well the President knew <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> personally, but it was his
                            impression that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was
                            totally inflexible on political questions.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that he had known <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> since 1960 and had no illusions about his
                            flexibility.</p>

                        <p>On the question of East-West relations, the President told the Chancellor
                            that the US wanted to explore all roads to better understanding and
                            specifically look at the possibilities of improving relations with the
                            Soviet Union. The President reassured the Chancellor that the US would
                            negotiate from a position of strength and keep the German Government
                            fully informed of its intentions. In this connection, the President
                            asked the Chancellor whether he had any suggestions on what the US might
                            do, or what the Federal Republic itself could do, to improve East-West
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said, as far as Germany was concerned, it made greater
                            sense to talk with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            than <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>. The latter was
                            nothing more than a Soviet flunkey. But the Chancellor thought the West
                            had to know more than it now did about the strength of the Soviet Union
                            and the extent of its present difficulties. The German Government had
                            the distinct impression that the situation inside the Soviet Union was
                            tense. He admitted this estimate was based on circumstantial <pb n="659"
                                xml:id="pg_659" facs="0681"/>evidence. However, it was gleaned from
                            dealings with the Soviet satellites and therefore of more than passing
                            significance.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, the Chancellor said the Germans were struck by the
                            fact that the satellites now seemed to have greater confidence and a
                            greater degree of independence than before. The Germans translated this
                            to mean that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> was not
                            in full control in the way that Stalin was or in the way <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> himself was in earlier
                            days.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor went on to say that some judgment also had to be made
                            about the current struggle between the Soviet Union and Red China. The
                            Germans doubted this was an ideological struggle. They were inclined to
                            believe that this was a competition for power. And this open rift was
                            not without its military implications. For one of the new facts of life
                            was that the Soviet Union now had to guard its Eastern and Western
                            frontiers.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor felt three things had to be borne in mind. First, that
                            modern technology in armaments and industry required vast sums of money
                            and Soviet attempts to fill the Siberian vacuum (bordering on the home
                            of 700 million Chinese) with people and industry, was a vast and
                            difficult undertaking. Second, the progressive adoption of middle-class
                            standards by Soviet society posed new and complicated problems for the
                            Soviet Government. And finally, the need to advance industry, added to
                            already difficult Soviet economic burdens, placed enormous if not
                            impossible demands on the Soviet economic machinery.</p>
                        <p>It was the German Government’s view that the Soviet economy just could
                            not meet all these requirements at the same time. Something had to give.
                            The question was where. If the savings were made in the defense areas,
                            so much the better. This would improve chances for an East-West
                            understanding.</p>
                        <p>In summary, the Chancellor stressed that although the Germans could not
                            talk with <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>, they might be
                            prepared to work with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>.
                            For the Soviet leadership in trouble might be interested in accepting
                            material and financial assistance and agree to permit progress in the
                            solution of the German question.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the President’s question as to the amount of financial
                            assistance the Germans had in mind, the Chancellor said the Federal
                            Government’s ideas were not quite firm. However, there could not be any
                            long-term credits without major political concessions. Competition among
                            the Western countries for extending credits to the Soviets would help
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> without bringing
                            about any improvement in the East-West situation. Political and economic
                            factors had to be tied together. And the Germans were prepared to make
                            substantial material and financial sacrifices in return for
                            self-determination and improvement in the Berlin and German
                            situations.</p>
                        <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0682"/>
                        <p>Continuing, the Chancellor said that the problem was very difficult for
                            the Germans. They were at loss on how to approach <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. The Soviet leader was not
                            likely to admit any readiness to enter into a bargain involving an
                            exchange of political concessions for material assistance. The
                            Chancellor thought, however, the US might do some of the probing, talk
                            with the Russians, and indicate that the Germans were prepared to make
                            sacrifices if progress on self-determination were possible. The
                            Chancellor doubted this would work but he thought it ought to be
                            considered, and felt there ought to be further consultation on it.</p>
                        <p>In his judgment, the Chancellor said the other problems were relatively
                            minor. If some understandings were reached, fine. But he warned against
                            illusions that these would bring about substantive changes in the world
                            situation. On the other hand, he admitted some progress might be
                            possible on major problems if <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> were really under heavy pressure. The
                            Chancellor readily admitted that no one had established how substantial
                            these pressures were, although the German impression was that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s present position was
                            distinctly uneasy.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed that such an assessment ought to be made, and the
                            problem fully considered.</p>

                        <p>The President, raising the subject of the arrangements concerning
                            Christmas visits in Berlin, said he was pleased with the project, for it
                            showed flexibility and imagination in dealing with a difficult
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor, however, did not think the results were all good. In
                            fact, the Federal Government had some second thoughts about these
                            arrangements. <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0683"/>Moreover, the
                            Chancellor was somewhat concerned about Soviet Zone plans to enter into
                            new discussions with the Berlin authorities (and excluding the Federal
                            authorities) for extension of these arrangements. <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> was not moved by humanitarian
                            considerations. His aims were political and his eye was clearly on the
                            consolidation of the three-state doctrine, with Berlin being an
                            independent entity. The Chancellor felt strongly that further moves had
                            to be carefully thought out, lest the world get the impression that
                            Berlin’s life and security were no longer tied to Bonn and Berlin was
                            leading a political life of its own. This, the Chancellor warned, could
                            have dangerous consequences for the Germans and the Allies. The
                            Chancellor said he was struck by the fact that even though Western
                            motives in reaching these arrangements had been wholly humanitarian,
                            East Bloc comment on the passes made no reference at all to the
                            humanitarian considerations; it only stressed that the agreement was
                            reached by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the “Berlin
                            Senat.” This was a dangerous political matter.</p>
                        <p>The German Government had not decided yet on how to deal with the next
                            step. A better assessment would have to await more definitive data. But,
                            the Chancellor wanted the President to appreciate the dangerous
                            implications of this development.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary told Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> he was very happy to see him here and looked
                            forward very much to this opportunity to discuss many things. He thought
                            it would be useful to start with Berlin, where developments were taking
                            a form not entirely predictable. While he was aware that the Foreign
                            Minister had been away from Bonn during a good part of the discussions
                            about Christmas passes, he would be interested in learning how the
                            Foreign Minister saw the situation and what he thought was likely to
                            develop from it, particularly insofar as it might affect the
                            responsibilities of the Three Powers in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said he
                            thought it would be useful to have a look at the background to this
                            development. He felt we could learn a good deal from what had happened
                            on the Christmas pass matter. Both <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Carstens</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WL5"
                                >Westrick</persName> had been in Bonn during these developments and
                            they could report more fully. He, himself, had had a couple of
                            concerns—First, that when the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had
                            received a letter from Absuch<note n="3" xml:id="d252fn3">For text of
                                Abusch’s December 5 letter, see <hi rend="italic">Dokumente zur

                            change in the basic <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> position, there
                            should have been the most careful consideration of what results we might
                            expect from our side before making a change in our position. Secondly,
                            there was a danger that we might be exposed to more public pressure than
                            we had expected; it was necessary to weigh the pros and cons of the
                            issue and to determine the extreme limits to which we were prepared to
                            go. This was a matter of continuing importance since he felt we could
                            expect continued pressure from the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.
                            The Foreign Minister asked <persName corresp="#p_CK1"

                                >Brandt</persName> on December 5. Abusch had suggested negotiations
                            between the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the Berlin Senat to
                            open East Berlin to West Berliners over the Christmas period. The <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had discussed the matter with the Senat
                            and expressed the view that the reply to Abusch should be that the
                            existing interzonal trade channels <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663"
                                facs="0685"/>(<persName corresp="#p_LK2"
                                >Leopold</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_BH9">Behrendt</persName>)
                            should be utilized for this purpose. A reply in this sense had gone
                            forward from the Senat, but the other side had said it could not
                            continue the talks on this basis and that there must be talks on the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>/Senat level. The <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had then agreed that it would be all
                            right for the Senat to inform the other side that some individual would
                            be designated by the Senat to discuss the matter. The reply had come
                            from Wendt, a State Secretary in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            Ministry of Cultural Affairs, that on this basis talks could be held,
                            the first in East Berlin, and the second in West Berlin. The Senat
                            designated Korber, a Senatstrat.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> said that all the
                            foregoing had been done in agreement with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> except on one point: the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> had asked Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> not to make any reference in this exchange to the
                            authority of the Mayor or the Senat, but this line had not quite been
                            followed. The Senat had sent a message which contained an introductory
                            phrase to the effect that “the Governing Mayor has asked me to tell you
                            this”.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> said it had become evident
                            after several discussions that general agreement regarding procedural
                            details for Christmas passes had almost been reached. The Secretary
                            commented that meanwhile the status of the matter had become public
                            knowledge. <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> said that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> had given a press conference on
                            the matter but had made reference to earlier stories in the Western
                            press on the subject.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> said it turned out fairly
                            promptly that what the other side really wanted was a signed agreement,
                            signed in the name of the Berlin Senat. At this point a further
                            discussion was held between the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and
                            the Senat. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had said it would be
                            better to avoid any signed agreement but that if this had to happen, it
                            was important that there should at least be no reference in it to the
                            Governing Mayor or the Berlin Senat. <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Carstens</persName> said the object was to play the whole thing
                            down to the question of agreements on the strictly technical level. He
                            was sure the people in Berlin had tried hard to get this point
                            established. But then came the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> press
                            conference which revealed how far agreement had progressed on the
                            details for Christmas passes; this served to increase public and
                            emotional pressures, particularly since the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> had said the only missing ingredient was a signed
                            document. At this point Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> had agreed that his representative, Korber,
                            should sign a paper indicating he was signing “by order of the Chief of
                            Chancellery of the Berlin Senat, who was in turn acting on the orders of
                            the Governing Mayor”. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had been
                            informed of this only after this proposal had been put forward.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> said it had been very
                            difficult for the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to decide whether
                            to accept or veto the proposal. They had finally decided to accept,
                            because a veto would have destroyed the hopes of a large number of West
                            Berliners.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> said he felt there had
                            been one mistake in the procedure followed—the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> and the Senat had not coordinated their actions and <pb
                                n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0686"/>decisions to a sufficient
                            degree. As concerned the future, he felt it necessary that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> agree with the Senat that some
                            individual in Berlin should act as the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> representative and that decisions would be made only
                            with his consent.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if the Berlin Commandants had been contacted about
                            this final reply to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> said the Commandants had issued
                            a statement that they were in agreement with what had been done; the
                            statement had also stressed that nothing had taken place which in any
                            way affected the status of Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> pointed out
                            that while the Commandants had been consulted, this had taken place only
                            after earlier consultations with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                            >FRG</gloss>. He thought it important that full consultation should take
                            place before any decisive step was taken. <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Carstens</persName> said he agreed completely. He added that the
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had reports that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> had also been acting under some
                            pressure, in the form of representations from <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_UW1"
                                >Ulbricht</persName>. Another point was that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was in a somewhat ridiculous position
                            since, under recent developments, East and West Germans had been able to
                            meet with each other in Prague but not in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wondered why the other side had been willing to
                            accept this startling and dramatic contrast between the treatment given
                            West and East Berliners. He recalled that one West Berliner who had gone
                            into East Berlin with a Christmas pass had commented that it was like
                            visiting a penitentiary. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>
                            said he thought there were two factions in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> on this issue. One faction had been in favor of
                            granting Christmas passes since it felt this was a device for extracting
                            concessions and an element of recognition for the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> from the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss>. This faction had obviously prevailed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wanted to make two comments: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>He believed the Federal Republic and West Berlin had an
                                    enormous gravitational pull on East Germans and East Berliners.
                                    If it were possible to open up and increase contacts, travel and
                                    communication between the people on both sides of the line, this
                                    would in a sense amount almost to de facto reunification.
                                    Admittedly, this was an historical, evolutionary process which
                                    would take time.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>On the other hand, we did not know very clearly just what the
                                    East had in mind. We should be particularly careful regarding
                                    the responsibilities of the Three Powers in Berlin. If we were
                                    to be involved in a crash landing we must also be there for the
                                    takeoff. It was most important that the three Commandants be
                                    fully consulted. He emphasized that we did not object to these
                                    contacts, but it must be made clear at every stage just how the
                                    responsibilities of the Three Powers are affected.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0687"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> commented that
                            the three Commandants were responsible for the security of West Berlin
                            and this matter had presented a number of problems for them of a
                            security nature.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we were not disposed to raise any formal or
                            hypothetical questions, but that if anything threatened to undermine or
                            erode Allied rights in Berlin this could be dangerous.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> whether von Eckhardt was not
                            already in Berlin as the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                            representative and whether he could not handle this matter of <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>/Senat consultation. Was <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> proposing anything different?
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> said that von Eckhard
                            could handle this “in principle”. <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> said there might be a question whether von
                            Eckhard would be the right person for this; there was no institutional
                            problem but only a question of the person involved.</p>
                        <p>At <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>’s request, Weber read
                            a press ticker item that the Berlin Senat Press Chief, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE5">Egon Bahr</persName>, had issued a public statement
                            in Berlin to the effect that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and
                            the Senat were united in the hope that further facilities for travel
                            between East and West Berlin could be obtained, but that further steps
                            would be taken only in agreement with all the parties concerned.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> said the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> did not wish to make public the fact it
                            felt it had been informed too late. He commented that it was very
                            difficult for the people in Berlin, where there were so many emotional
                            pressures, to instruct the negotiators properly. It might be better for
                            the instructions to come from people further away from the scene where
                            the emotional pressures were less.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had the feeling that over the past five or six
                            years the West Germans and the West Berliners had underestimated the
                            power of the attraction the West had for the East Germans. If contacts
                            could be increased, the East Germans were bound to be attracted even
                            more. The contrast between West and East Germany was very great indeed.
                            He recalled how many East Germans had “voted with their feet”. We were,
                            therefore, relaxed about opening up these contacts. But we must remain
                            in close touch on this life-and-death matter. This was probably the
                            principal issue involving war or peace between the East and the West. In
                            any case, he was sympathetic with the efforts of the West Berliners to
                            put holes through the wall in Berlin.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said he was not so
                            optimistic as the Secretary on this point. He felt it essential to think
                            through to the final conclusion the consequences of the steps now being
                            taken. While he agreed that the West had a magnetic attraction for the
                            East Germans—after all, this was the basis for their firm hope that if
                            self-determination were granted to the East Germans they would opt for
                            the West—there was still the very serious question of how far we could
                            make use of this factor unless at the <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666"
                                facs="0688"/>same time some of the institutional aspects in East
                            Germany could be changed. If we merely went along the path of accepting
                            all offers from the East to ameliorate conditions, this could work out
                            to the advantage of the other side, since it would serve to make them
                            look more human and increase their attractiveness. There was a danger
                            that this could reach the point where world public opinion would feel it
                            was possible for the West Germans to reach agreement with the other side
                            even though there were no basic changes in the status quo. It was vital
                            that things in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> be changed
                            basically; otherwise, world public opinion might force the West Germans
                            to accept the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> theses of “all Germans
                            around one table”, confederation, and the like, even though there was no
                            basic change in the situation. There would be a problem about where we
                            could draw the line without running into trouble with public
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> inquired
                            whether this development might not have been a response to the speech
                            made recently in Berlin by Federal Minister <persName corresp="#p_ME4"
                                >Mende</persName>. Maybe the original initiative had in effect come
                            from the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>? <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> said he did not think the <persName
                                corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> speech had anything to do with
                            this though <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> perhaps thought
                            differently. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> offer was mere
                            repetition of offers which had been made in the past, even as long as
                            two years ago. When he had first heard about the Absuch offer, he had,
                            himself, seen no chance of agreement being reached. He had pointed out
                            to the Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee the danger that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would indicate readiness to talk any
                            time about Christmas passes or anything else, but without making any
                            basic concessions, with the risk that public opinion could shift against
                            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> if it did not agree to such
                            talks. His first reaction had been that the Absuch letter should be
                            rejected. He had felt that to accept the offer would be a step toward
                            recognition of the East Zone and of West Berlin as an independent
                            entity. But then things had gotten out of hand. He thought it was too
                            early to take such steps. This particular step had been taken as an
                            “unpolitical” step because of Christmas sentiment, but he thought it was
                            a mistake. (He asked Weber to translate for the group the Christmas
                            greetings which had been handed to each West Berliner visiting East
                            Berlin, which was full of propaganda and appealed to West Berliners to
                            support the idea of rapprochement between the two Germanies by
                            negotiations.)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said he felt we must
                            think through this concept of the powerful attraction of West Germany
                            and West Berlin for the East Germans. No one had yet been able to
                            develop for him a complete theory as to just what the final result would
                            be from promoting these contacts. It must be explained to him just what
                            changes could be brought about in the East Zone system which would bring
                            reunification closer. Admittedly these steps might improve conditions
                            from the humanitarian <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0689"
                            />standpoint, but he had not yet met anyone who could convince him that
                            going along this path of quasi-recognition would not consolidate the
                            status quo.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we had no particular fixed theory on this. There was
                            in any case no problem with us about recognition. We were more strict on
                            this than other members of the Alliance. He was, himself, impressed with
                            the longing on the part of the East Germans to rejoin their brothers in
                            West Germany. Things were changing in Eastern Europe. it would be a good
                            thing if the people in Eastern Europe could lose their fear of Germany
                            and in particular of a unified Germany. To the extent that they lost
                            these fears this would help remove the obstacles to reunification.
                            Another question was to what extent the East German Army would prove
                            reliable to the Soviets in a crisis. There was in any case movement in
                            the status quo and the question for us all was how we could make use of
                            this movement to our advantage. This sort of question might well be
                            discussed in the Ambassadorial Group.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>’s long-term policies in Eastern Europe
                            reflected the Secretary’s thinking, and he agreed this would all take
                            time. But he was concerned that if the Soviets had told the East Zone
                            regime to adopt a different approach the Soviets had not done this in
                            order to help the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> but rather to help
                            consolidate <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> and his
                            regime. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said it was
                            difficult for people who had not lived under a totalitarian regime to
                            appreciate its effectiveness. He cited the example of Poland, where 90
                            per cent of the people were opposed to the regime but where the country
                            was effectively controlled by the 10 per cent representing the armed
                            Communist elite. The same situation prevailed in East Germany. He felt
                            that the basic situation could be changed there only through either a
                            change in the world power situation or through armed intervention. The
                            latter was obviously excluded. He was not, himself, convinced that the
                            internal structure of a Communist regime could be changed by the
                            measures we had been discussing.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> arrived, and the Secretary suggested that we might
                            come back to this issue later and start talking about what had happened
                            in the trade negotiations in Brussels.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> agreed
                            we should come back to this point about consultations on Berlin problems
                            and the need to improve the consultative process. Before leaving it, he
                            wished to offer one suggestion. Maybe we should consider that these
                            consultations should be held in Bonn rather than in Berlin. In Bonn
                            there were the three Ambassadors and the Federal Government, and we
                            could get representatives from the Berlin Senat down to Bonn. The
                            present situation was very bad indeed because no one seemed to have a
                            clear idea of just what was happening.</p>
                        <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0690"/>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed that we must have clear procedures, but he would
                            like to think about <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>’s
                            suggestion before making any definite reply. He commented that there was
                            one further problem. Should the East Germans continue to let West
                            Berliners come into East Berlin regularly and improve conditions in
                            other respects, there could come a time when the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> might approach the Berlin Senat and suggest that the
                            Senat ask the Allies to reduce their troops in Berlin by 50 per cent and
                            accept Swedes and other neutrals in their place. This would put us in a
                            bad position. We had run the risk of war in the past in order to resist
                            just such proposals.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said there still was a
                            question as to whether Berlin should be permitted to make all-German
                            policies. This could be dangerous not only for the Allied governments
                            but would be contrary to the policies of the Federal Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> said he wished to point
                            out that Allied rights in Berlin rested on occupation rights dating back
                            to 1945, and that we should be careful about undermining the authority
                            of the Berlin Commandants by shifting the focus of discussions of this
                            nature to Bonn.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> said we should
                            think in terms of what price should be paid in exchange for gaining
                            improvements in the Berlin situation. <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> said this was precisely the point he was
                            trying to make. What we needed to do was to think through the
                            consequences of the first step which had now been taken. It was
                            difficult to predict where this might end. What we needed was an overall
                            strategy concept rather than pursuing the matter on the basis of the
                            “optimism of dilettantes”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stressed the need to have full discussion of these problems
                            with Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>. It was
                            absolutely necessary that we proceed only with the complete unity of
                            everyone on our own side. We would harm our own cause greatly if
                            developments should take a turn which would lead the West Berlin
                            population to disapprove of Western policies. He said he wished to say
                            in complete confidence that he felt there was only one circumstance
                            which could remove US forces from Berlin—this would be if the West
                            Berliners should say that we do not want your forces here. US public
                            opinion would then be a controlling factor. We must all be together,
                            including Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> commented that the
                            viewpoints in Berlin seemed to differ now more than in former years.
                            Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>, for example, was
                            trying to mediate the situation, but there were others in Berlin who had
                            reproached the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> for not being strict
                            enough about this matter of Christmas passes. This showed how much more
                            complicated the situation in Berlin had become.</p>
                        <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0691"/>
                        <p>At this point Governor Herter arrived, and the Secretary suggested that
                            the meeting now turn its attention to the “dismal science” of the
                            economic problems raised by the matters covered in the recent Brussels
                            agreement.</p>

                        <p>President <persName>Johnson</persName> said that he would like to ask the
                            Chancellor about East-West relations. Does the Chancellor feel that we
                            are doing enough to find solutions to the problems dividing the
                            world?</p>
                        <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> replied that
                            first of all he believes it is important not to think only in terms of
                            what the West might do. It is necessary also to look at the position of
                            the East and its responses to Western offers. Responses from the East
                            have not so far been encouraging. There have been many Western
                            suggestions but few encouraging responses. It is true that a test ban
                            agreement was reached, and this reduced the threat of a hot war. But
                            there has not been a favorable response in other areas, as for example
                            on observation posts.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said that our views would be more meaningful if we had a
                            more exact evaluation of the Russian position, if we knew how deep the
                            trouble is in the Soviet Union. The Chancellor said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would discuss this subject in the
                            Ambassadorial Group.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he interpreted the Chancellor’s remarks as
                            indicating the view that the Soviets may be in pretty serious trouble.
                            The <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0692"/>Chancellor said that he
                            thinks they are, but that he doubted the Soviets have reached a stage of
                            being willing to change their policies in any visible way. The Soviets
                            remain concerned about their prestige, as dictatorships are more than
                            democracies.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said that he was favorable to the proposed wheat sales to
                            the Soviet Union. He does not believe this is a point on which the West
                            should be tough. The Chancellor noted that the German people would have
                            starved in the period after World War II had it not been for US aid.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was
                            not selling flour to the Soviet Union. The Chancellor said this was
                            true.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor commented that he felt the recent autobahn incidents had
                            been no accident. The Chancellor then reiterated his view that we should
                            not always be thinking in terms of what we should do; we should also
                            look at the attitude of the other side.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor commented that sometimes these subjects can get hot. The
                            Christmas pass issue has dynamite in it even though it looks harmless.
                            The East Germans and Soviets are pressing their three-state theory. The
                            question is arising as to who speaks for Berlin. The <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> position up to now has been that the
                            Berlin Senat and the Federal Government will jointly carry out
                            discussions and any arrangements entered into.</p>
                        <p>The meeting ended at 5:15 p.m.</p>

                        <p>Returning to the subject of East-West relations, the President told the
                            Chancellor he was under no illusions as to what might be accomplished
                            with the Soviets. Nevertheless, if imaginations were put to work,
                            somehow and some way ideas might emerge which promised hope.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor assured the President that the Federal Government was not
                            opposed to a relaxation of tensions. Germany could not afford to take
                            such a position. It was incumbent upon everyone, and especially for the
                            Germans, to see what could be done to make war impossible. And the
                            Germans, for their part, would try to make constructive contributions to
                            this end.</p>
                        <p>The President said he found this encouraging and was indeed pleased with
                            the leadership Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                            was giving Germany.</p>
                        <p>The President emphasized that the West must lead from strength; and that
                            the US was prepared to do its part. This year, the US was thinking in
                            terms of a $50 billion defense budget and the German defense budget of
                                <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 20 billion was an important
                            element in the overall western defense posture.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said the Federal Republic would do all it could to avoid
                            the dangers of war. However, it was impossible for the Federal
                            Government to approach <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            directly. He wondered therefore whether the US might be willing to make
                            the necessary approaches to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>, making it clear that the US could not
                            renounce the principle of self-determination. The Chancellor suggested
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> might also be told
                            Germany was prepared to make real sacrifices to this end. The Federal
                            Republic was not only ready to extend credits; it was prepared to make
                            other kinds of substantive contributions.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor then asked whether the President might be willing to
                            explore with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> possible
                            solutions to some of the urgent problems in Europe. In this connection,
                            the Chancellor mentioned that six or seven years ago as Minister of
                            Economics he received an invitation to visit the Soviet Union. But this
                            invitation was no longer valid now that he was Chancellor. However, this
                            was no reason for not communicating. In fact, the Chancellor thought the
                            Western powers ought to continue to explore with the Soviets possible
                            points of agreement and attempt to determine whether economics might not
                            buy political solutions.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had no illusions about <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>. Moreover, he had no intention of meeting
                            with him unless and until such a meeting could produce concrete,
                            positive results. By the same token, he <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672"
                                facs="0694"/>was prepared to go anywhere and talk with anyone if
                            something useful could be accomplished.</p>
                        <p>The US, the President continued, had a $50 billion defense budget and its
                            combat strength had increased considerably during the past three years.
                            This was an important element in the equation. The US always had to lead
                            from strength and be prepared to defend itself.</p>
                        <p>The President said one of his principal concerns, however, was that there
                            seemed to be a dearth of new ideas for relieving international tensions.
                            A considerable amount of planning had been done in the State Department
                            and elsewhere. But the end result always seemed to be that we would have
                            to travel along until we slid into war. Perhaps the Chancellor had ideas
                            on how we might make things just a little easier for ourselves by making
                            Soviet aggression less likely. For if there is no relaxation, there
                            could suddenly be a situation where “<persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> goes for our jugular.”</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor thought things were going very rapidly and clearly we had
                            to think in different categories than we did fifteen years ago. Some
                            good might come out of all this movement, but he, the Chancellor,
                            thought it necessary to remain hard-headed. The Soviets seemed to be
                            having real difficulties, and if the West had a better idea of what was
                            going on in the Soviet Union, it might be better prepared to deal with
                            the Kremlin. The Chancellor mentioned that Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had told him that such studies were
                            now under way and that the conclusions would be made available to the
                            Chancellor. This would certainly help in making the necessary political
                            judgments.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed, but added that as soon as the study was finished
                            and more precise information available, minds and resources had to be
                            applied to see what might be done. It was especially important to do so
                            while <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> was still weak,
                            for it would be a great mistake to wait until the Soviets recovered.</p>
                        <p>The President said what disturbed him a great deal was that the West
                            seemed to be getting all the wrong headlines. Wheat sales and the test
                            ban agreement were not looked upon as the Western powers’ will for
                            peace. The Soviets seemed to get the major credit for these developments
                            even though <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> did not do
                            more about peace than we have done and are doing. While we must stay
                            strong, we also must remain reasonable. One of the things that troubled
                            him over the past six or seven years was Chancellor <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>’s numerous warnings to the
                            President to “be careful” and “not trust <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>.” The fact was that he did not trust
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. But by the same
                            token he did not think the Western powers could remain insensitive to
                            world opinion and he thought it would be a great mistake if the West
                            refused to consider moves toward peace.</p>
                        <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0695"/>
                        <p>The Chancellor said he talked about this often with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>. But <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> always insisted that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> was isolated in a fortress
                            under siege and therefore the only alternative was to starve him out.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said he never accepted
                            this view. On the contrary, it was his view that it is dangerous to push
                            dictators into a corner. This was bound to produce irrational reactions,
                            and the Germans probably knew more about this than any other people
                            since they lived with unpredictable dictators and watched them react
                            under pressure.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor expressed his personal appreciation for this candid
                            exchange of views. He was pleased that there seemed to be a meeting of
                            the minds and his views of the important problems were not unlike those
                            of the President.</p>
                        <p>The President reiterated that it was absolutely essential that the US
                            remain strong and not allow itself to be weakened. At the same time, its
                            policy had to be one of live and let live. The President was sure
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> knew he did not
                            have to worry that US bombs would be dropped on him. By the same token,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had to understand
                            he would not be permitted to subvert this hemisphere. The US wanted no
                            more Cubas. The US was willing to guarantee Moscow’s survival in return
                            for comparable Soviet guarantees for Berlin and New York. Everything was
                            capable of solution if minds were put to work. However, it was not
                            enough to talk peace; something had to be done about it.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, the President said he again wanted to reaffirm US
                            commitments to Germany. However, Germany does have commitments to the US
                            which it demonstrated by agreeing to a defense budget of <gloss
                                target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 20 billion.</p>
                        <p>The President then reemphasized that areas of agreement had to be found.
                            He hoped to remain in touch with the Chancellor so there would be no
                            lack of understanding on either side, and each would know what the other
                            was doing.</p>
                        <p>The President then shifted the discussion and said he wanted to make one
                            point absolutely clear since this was a matter of continuous
                            speculation—he had no antipathy for nor was he disappointed by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. He knew the
                            General well. Both he and the General understood the problems between
                            us, and both realized that for the most part they did not lend
                            themselves to simple or easy solutions. However, the President added he
                            was certain that when the chips were down, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would stick by the alliance
                            as he did during the Cuban crisis and on other occasions.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said so many changes were taking place in the world, the
                            German people were in a quandary as to how to react. Would the future
                            course be protectionism and isolation or trade expansion and wider
                            association? In Brussels the Germans put up a strong fight for the <pb
                                n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0696"/><persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> Round for this is an essential prerequisite to
                            wider world trade. The Chancellor said he would be willing to go to
                            Geneva himself if his presence there would assure this. But the
                            Chancellor also felt the President should know—and he emphasized that he
                            was telling this to him in all frankness—that there was wide speculation
                            that the US intended to loosen its military and political ties with
                            Europe. And if there was to be any success in Geneva, answers had to be
                            given to these unspoken questions to end this harmful kind of
                            speculation.</p>
                        <p>The President appreciated this comment. He said he wanted to reassure the
                            Chancellor that there need be no doubt about changes in US plans or
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>(At this point, the President invited Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2"
                                >Bundy</persName> to join the talks to discuss possible Western
                            approaches to the Soviet Union.)</p>
                        <p>The President emphasized again that dealings with the Soviets had to be
                            from a position of strength. The Federal Republic had its defense budget
                            of <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 20 billion and the US its budget of
                            $50 billion. The US had a continuing commitment to keep its six
                            divisions in Europe. There was no question in the President’s mind but
                            that the West needed a strong, unified Europe tied to a strong America
                            in an unbreakable alliance. However, talk was not enough. Something had
                            to be done about it. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            was weakened by his difficulties with his Chinese allies and his
                            economic problems at home. But the West did not seem to be taking
                            advantage of the situation. The President felt strongly that it was
                            important for the Western powers to use their imaginations and ingenuity
                            to get what they could and what they had to have. This was the time for
                            the partnership to see what it could do and take the necessary
                            action.</p>
                        <p>Turning to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>, the
                            President explained that he had asked the Chancellor for his ideas and
                            thoughts for dealing with the East-West situation. He explained that the
                            Chancellor indicated his willingness to make some concessions to the
                            Soviets, perhaps in the form of large loans. However, the Chancellor did
                            not think the Germans could propose this to the Soviets. They preferred
                            to have the US handle this matter with Moscow. The President thought
                            this proposal ought to be carefully considered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> explained that as he saw
                            it the problem was to try to find something that could be offered to the
                            Soviets which the Kremlin wanted and which was worth more to them than
                            to the West, in return for which the Western position in Berlin, where
                            the greatest danger to peace now existed, would be strengthened. The
                            West had to look for the kind of proposal that went to the heart of the
                            problem—that relieved the existing political situation in Germany
                            without bringing about the recognition of East Germany. The Federal
                            Republic was not prepared to consider recognition, and neither was the
                            US. Nevertheless, the West had to make clear to the Soviets it was
                            prepared to work toward a settlement.<pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675"
                                facs="0697"/> Therefore the US looked to the Chancellor for
                            suggestions for improving the lot of the Germans living in East Germany;
                            strengthening the Western position in Berlin; and in the last analysis
                            providing a clear quid pro quo for the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor admitted that under <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> it was difficult to get such talks started. The
                            German Government agrees that pressures must be put on <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, but the question is how and
                            where. A better assessment of the Soviet situation would be most
                            helpful. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> is having
                            problems. He is clearly under pressure on several fronts. He therefore
                            is probably approachable. In this kind of situation, credits could be
                            attractive, and <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> might
                            be interested in such a proposition. Long-term credits from the West,
                            however, depended on a real relaxation of tensions. However, if such a
                            dialogue were undertaken, the US would have to insist upon Soviet
                            acceptance of the principle of self-determination. There would also have
                            to be a phased and synchronized time table to insure the right of the
                            German people to decide their future. Germany was willing to pay the
                            price. It was prepared to offer credits and other kinds of assistance,
                            including help for Soviet industry in Eastern Siberia. But in addition
                            to economic assistance, there had to be a phased program for increasing
                            freedom in East Germany and East Berlin, and leading to free elections.
                            The Chancellor said he realized this was a radical plan. Sometimes,
                            however, such plans were easier to achieve than the conventional
                            ones.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor admitted he had no illusions about the ease of getting
                            such a program under way. However, he was sure he could appeal to the
                            German people for the necessary sacrifices. These sacrifices would not
                            only be good for the Germans; they would demonstrate to the world that
                            the Germans’ principal interest was reunification and not revanchism. In
                            this connection, the Chancellor said he wanted to add a word of
                            caution—that under no circumstances could such a program be considered
                            reparations. Economic sacrifices of this order had to buy freedom for
                            the German people.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> said he wanted to
                            reiterate a point made earlier. The President appreciated the difficulty
                            of the German problem. However, there were people in the US who were
                            putting pressure on the President for an early solution. Their argument
                            is that the difficulties being discussed are not really decisive or
                            real; and that in fact there are a number of options open to us.
                            Moreover, they feel <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            needs time and an easing situation if he is to make any counter
                            concessions. At the present time, this kind of development seemed
                            blocked by the Federal Republic’s rigid attitude toward East Germany.
                                <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>, these people argue,
                            remains in control because the Soviets have no alternative and West
                            Germany’s rigidity on contacts with the Soviet Zone will not facilitate
                            self-determination. They go on to say <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> cannot be bought <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676"
                                facs="0698"/>off. The only way to move toward a German solution is
                            for the Federal Republic’s relations to East Germany to develop as they
                            did with Poland, Rumania and Czechoslovakia. Therefore, they conclude
                            the answer to the present impasse is to seek an interim agreement
                            preserving the freedom of Berlin; defuse the access question; and take a
                            more flexible position on the question of relations with East Germany.
                            “That is what people are telling us, Mr. Chancellor. And my question to
                            you, sir, is what shall we answer?”</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said he was convinced that any recognition of the Soviet
                            Zone, even only superficial, would mean the final and irrevocable split
                            of Germany. There should be no illusions about this. The two parts of
                            Germany were quite different socially and economically. It was
                            impossible to reconcile them. The Federal Republic was free, democratic
                            and capitalistic. The Soviet Zone was undemocratic, unfree, and
                            communistic. There is no middle ground. If the Communists are permitted
                            a breakthrough, the split will be final. The Chancellor vehemently
                            denied that the West Germans were out of touch with the East Germans.
                            The Federal Republic, for example, is trading with the Soviet Zone; West
                            German credits were offered to improve the lot of the East Germans.
                            There are communications between the two parts of Germany. There were
                            even the Christmas passes. But the fact remains that it was the East
                            Germans who built the wall. East Germans can come to the Federal
                            Republic any time and without passes; West Berliners need passes to
                            enter East Berlin. The West Germans and the West Berliners want to see
                            German life normalized and therefore certain agreements are possible.
                            The Chancellor said he understood the Ambassadorial Group was now
                            looking at possible new initiatives, but it was too early to predict the
                            results. He went on to say that he understood the pressures the
                            President was under to provide answers on how to proceed. But the German
                            Government was not viewing the problem from a narrow point of view. It
                            was taking into consideration not only German needs but also the needs
                            of Germany’s friends and allies. Nevertheless, the Chancellor promised
                            to give this matter further thought, but warned against an easy
                            solution, given the history of this complicated problem.</p>
                        <p>The President said he appreciated this. Nevertheless, he was concerned
                            that inaction could produce disaster. Much therefore depended upon the
                            ideas the West could produce and particularly on what the Germans might
                            come up with.</p>
                        <p>Concluding, the Chancellor pointed out that the Soviets were signatories
                            to the Potsdam Agreement which committed them to a peace treaty
                            following all-German elections. If such elections were permitted, West
                            Germans were fully prepared to accept comprehensive international
                            controls. One would assume, however, that the Soviet Zone would also
                            submit to such controls. In addition, the Chancellor said, <pb n="677"
                                xml:id="pg_677" facs="0699"/>there would have to be free movement of
                            all Germans to permit full campaigning on both sides. The Germans were
                            ready to decide their own destiny, and once that was out of the way, the
                            boundary problems could be resolved. (The Chancellor asked the President
                            to keep this information absolutely confidential.) Germany could and
                            would live in peace with its Eastern neighbors.</p>

                        <p>After the President and the Chancellor had gone into private
                                session,<note n="2" xml:id="d255fn2">See <ref target="#d254"
                                    >Document 254</ref>.</note> the Secretary suggested that a small
                            group convene to continue yesterday’s discussion of certain Berlin and
                            all-German problems.</p>
                        <p>He said he first wanted to say a word about the procedures for
                            consultation on problems in Berlin. He was himself inclined to use
                            procedures <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0700"/>now in force,
                            involving the Four-Power Group in Bonn, the Ambassadorial Group in
                            Washington, and existing arrangements for Bonn to keep in close touch
                            with the Commandants and Senat in Berlin.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> said the problem arose
                            from the fact that as concerned contacts between the Commandants and the
                            Senat it was difficult under present procedures for the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to be fully in the picture. It was
                            absolutely essential for the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to be
                            fully informed at all times. He therefore wished to suggest that the
                            focal point for consultations be in Bonn where there were the three
                            Ambassadors, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and a
                            representative of the Senat. (Note: <persName corresp="#p_SK4">Klaus
                                Schuetz</persName>, Senator for Federal Affairs.) This would insure
                            that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> knew what everyone was
                            saying at one time—there had been much difficulty in the past with
                            knowing what had been said here and what had been said there. The <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was always getting different stories.
                            It was essential that there be one place where the Three Powers, the
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the Senat could all sit
                            around one table.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we must be very careful not to diminish in any way the
                            authority of the Commandants in Berlin. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> stressed the importance of the
                            three Commandants in Berlin meeting frequently as a group. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> pointed out that while there were
                            many types of problems regarding Berlin which might arise, there were
                            some which fell strictly within the competence of the
                            Commandants—particularly those matters affecting the security of Berlin.
                            He thought <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>’ suggestion
                            might create problems in this respect.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> said that his proposed
                            procedure would be limited to those particular contacts and discussions
                            which were already under way in Berlin. As concerned this matter, it was
                            absolutely necessary for the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to know
                            who was saying what, and to arrive quickly at the stage where we were
                            all sure we were in full agreement. This could be done only if all those
                            concerned were assembled in one place. He pointed out again that the
                            Berlin Senat had a permanent representative in Bonn and also mentioned
                            the divergent trends in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that if we had this procedure for 5-party
                            consultation differing from existing procedures, there was the
                            possibility we could have five vetoes. This was undesirable. It was
                            essential that the three Commandants in Berlin remain in a position to
                            give instructions to the Berlin Senat.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> pointed out
                            that there were even certain aspects of the present problem of passes
                            which were within the sole competence of the Commandants insofar as they
                            might affect the security of Berlin (as, for example, the location of
                            pass offices).</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> said his immediate concern
                            was how we should coordinate the matter of the answer to be given to the
                            next initiative from the East. There were indications that such an
                            initiative was already under <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0701"
                            />way. There would be strong pressures to continue the measures which
                            had been started, but we should not let the other side exploit any
                            differences among us. He agreed that we should do nothing to prevent the
                            Commandants from continuing to carry out their existing
                            responsibilities, but he did not feel that what he was proposing would
                            have any such effect.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was still not clear why the existing machinery was
                            not satisfactory. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName>
                            commented that we had always looked to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> and the Senat to coordinate between themselves the
                            German position on Berlin matters. Why wasn’t the present arrangement
                            adequate for this?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> observed that, as he
                            understood <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>’ point, the
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was afraid it would get
                            “whip-sawed” by hearing two different things from two different sources.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> said this was right;
                            they had already gone through this several times. He stressed again that
                            what he was proposing would not in any way affect the rights and
                            responsibilities of the Commandants.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired whether the Senat had good and secure
                            communications with its representative in Bonn. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> said this was the case and
                            added that <persName corresp="#p_SK4">Schuetz</persName> was very close
                            to <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> personally. He said
                            his suggested procedure should be used only in cases where “all four of
                            us agree there should be a conference of five”. This was the only way to
                            handle the problem rapidly.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we would consider the matter further and take it up
                            with the French and British.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> said that if <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>’ suggestion were adopted, we
                            should not let on that this represented any big change. It would be
                            important not to give Moscow the idea there had been any modification in
                            Bonn-Berlin relations. It would also be important not to give the
                            appearance of by-passing the Commandants and making them less
                            visible.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> commented that an
                            alternative procedure might be to bring the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> into the Senat-Commandant discussions in Berlin. This
                            was not now being done and to do so would in fact represent a real
                            change. But what he was proposing was not in fact a change in existing
                            procedures.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded the discussions at this point by saying it was
                            agreed that we would look into <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Carstens</persName>’ proposal and maybe give it a try.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary suggested that the meeting turn to consideration of a new
                            initiative on the all-German problem.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said the
                            Germans were preparing a paper on the subject for discussion with the
                            other three governments, which could then be considered by the
                            Ambassadorial Group. The paper would first have to be approved by the
                            Cabinet in Bonn, but he thought it would be ready for submission to
                            other governments by mid-January.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled our experience in dealing with the Soviets on such
                            occasions as the meetings of the Deputies for the Austrian Peace Treaty,
                            the Palais Rose, etc. He asked whether what <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> had in mind was an effort to set up a
                            four-power group with German participation with a broad frame of
                            reference.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said he felt there should
                            be no Germans at all in this group. If the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> were represented, Pankow would also claim the right to
                            participate and we would have a replica of the situation at Geneva in
                            1959. This the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> wished to avoid.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired about the terms of reference—should they be
                            detailed or general. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>
                            said the Germans had in mind possibly five points: a timetable for the
                            transitional period, a plan for reunification and European security, a
                            draft electoral law, a procedure for settling disputes, and a proposal
                            for supervising the conduct of the elections.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that with such a frame of reference it would be
                            his guess that no meeting with the Soviets would ever take place.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> agreed it was
                            difficult to suggest anything acceptable to the other side. He felt our
                            position could remain very flexible. These were merely ideas to try to
                            help make progress.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he felt a distinction should be drawn between broad
                            terms of reference on the one hand for discussions with the Soviets, and
                            on the other the arrangements among themselves (US, UK, France and
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>) which would have to be very
                            detailed. We should be <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0703"/>prepared
                            to meet an impasse with the Soviets at the outset, although it might be
                            possible over a period of time to make gradual progress on certain
                            aspects, such as the humanitarian side. Based on our experience with the
                            Austrian Treaty he felt that if any such group were set up it should be
                            prepared to hold at least 300 meetings.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had a question about the plebiscite. Was <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> confident that if a fair
                            plebiscite could be held on the issue of whether the Germans wanted a
                            united or divided Germany, the vote would come out on our side?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> replied that there would
                            be no point in the Germans talking about self-determination as they had
                            been doing unless they were prepared to go all the way through with it.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> said the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> did not have much doubt on this score.
                            He cited the observations of the London Times’ correspondent who had
                            recently visited East Germany and expressed the view that a fair
                            election would result in an overall vote of at least 80 per cent in
                            favor of the West.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary cited the example of Puerto Rico where our position on this
                            issue was very powerful. If anyone raised the issue of Puerto Rico
                            independence, we could always say “Why don’t you ask the Puerto Ricans”?
                            He recalled that the Soviets had frequently said, without really meaning
                            it, that reunification was up to the Germans themselves. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said that what the Soviets
                            really meant was—ask the Pankow regime. <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Carstens</persName> referred to the formula in the Heads of
                            Government Directive at Geneva in 1955<note n="1" xml:id="d256fn1">For
                                text, see <ref target="frus1955-57v05#pg_527"><hi rend="italic"

                            which called for German reunification by free elections “to be carried
                            out in conformity with the national interests of the German people” and
                            pointed out that the Soviets had interpreted this phrase in such a way
                            as to block completely any possibility of free elections.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Krapf</persName> inquired whether consultation should take
                            place first in the capitals or in the Ambassadorial Group. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said this point had been
                            discussed in Paris among the Foreign Ministers, and he would himself see
                            no objection in having it discussed first in the Ambassadorial Group.
                            The Secretary said this would mean that the first discussion would be
                            very brief since the matter would have to be referred to governments.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> replied that the
                            matter had been discussed with <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1"
                                >Couve</persName> and the other Foreign Ministers in Paris and he
                            had considered <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>’s reaction
                            to the idea of a new German initiative very forthcoming. The Secretary
                            commented that this might be one of the fruits of the Franco-German
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> commented on the
                            importance of discussing the whole thing among ourselves in great detail
                            before any approach was made to <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0704"
                            />the Soviets. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> stressed
                            the need to hold the matter closely, particularly in view of the fact
                            that the press was already apparently aware that something was up; he
                            cited the recent Gruson story from London on the subject.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he agreed we should put our minds to this in the
                            Ambassadorial Group. There were some aspects of the matter from the
                            standpoint of European security which might be difficult and
                            complicated. For example, how could we assure that German reunification
                            would not upset the existing power balance? He commented that this was
                            the only major issue on which an East-West armed conflict could occur.
                            There would be various other things such as observation posts,
                            non-aggression pacts and the like, which would have to come into the
                            picture.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> what he would think of setting
                            up a link between improvement of access to Berlin—as for example, by an
                            International Access Authority—and a non-aggression pact. This link
                            would be established on the basis that the <gloss target="#t_NAP1"
                                >NAP</gloss> would become null and void in the event of any new
                            interference with Berlin access which might impel us to use an armed
                            probe.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said they had not quite
                            made up their minds on this. He felt it would impose a heavy burden on
                            the Swiss, Swede or whoever might be Chairman of the Access Authority to
                            take decisions involving peace or war. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> commented that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> felt the Soviets
                            would not agree to establishing the Access Authority solely in exchange
                            for the <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> added that he felt the Soviets were not
                            prepared to do anything which would exclude the idea of setting up West
                            Berlin as a free city.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired whether there would be any point in proposing that
                            the Berlin Wall be established on the east frontier of East Berlin.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> commented merely that
                            several hundred thousand people would leave East Berlin and not come
                            back. The Secretary made reference to Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName>’s idea about letting East Berliners enter West
                            Berlin freely on the basis of a guarantee that they would not move any
                            further West than West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> inquired about
                            the possibility of using interzonal trade and credits to arouse
                            expectations on the other side. This could then put the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in a position to make demands on the
                            East. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said he thought
                            this was underestimating the realities in a totalitarian system.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> added that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> had not yet reacted to the offer of
                            increased credits in <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss>, which had been
                            put forward over a year ago.</p>
                        <p>The meeting then adjourned to proceed to the barbecue at Stonewall.</p>
