                <p>The present volume of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United
                        States</hi> is the first in a special series of <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> volumes covering the relations of the United States with
                    China for the years 1942 to 1949, inclusive. This series is part of the
                    publication program adopted by the Department of State in response to
                    expressions of interest by several Senators and the Senate Committee on
                    Appropriations in its report for the fiscal year 1954. The program also includes
                    publication of records of the top-level conferences of World War II and the
                    accelerated publication of the regular annual volumes of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The principles of compilation and editing for this China series are the same as
                    those for the regular annual volumes as set forth in the Department order
                    printed in the preface to <ref target="frus1939v01">
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1939, Volume I</ref>. The
                    background documentation on the internal political and military situation in
                    China is somewhat fuller than usual, in view of the special interest of the
                    United States in the struggle which resulted in the establishment of a Communist
                    regime controlling the mainland of China and in view of the bearing of the
                    Chinese internal conflict on the policies followed by the United States
                    Government with respect to China.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes are primarily concerned with
                    documentation of diplomatic activities within the responsibility of the
                    Department of State. Some documents from other agencies have been printed where
                    they have been deemed necessary to supplement the Department’s records and thus
                    give a better understanding of the problems treated.</p>
                <p>Military records dealing with China during 1942 have been discussed in narrative
                    histories published by the Departments of the Army and Air Force. Most important
                    for this period are <hi rend="italic">United States Army in World War II: The
                        China–Burma–India Theater: Stilwell’s Mission to China</hi>, by Charles F.
                    Romanus and Riley Sunderland, published in 1953, and <hi rend="italic">The Army
                        Air Forces in World War II</hi>, edited by W. F. Craven and J. L. Cate,
                    Volumes I and IV, published in 1948 and 1950, respectively. These histories
                    provide relevant background information for documents referring to military
                    activities.</p>
                <p>The preparation of the present <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series on
                    China has been under the general supervision of the Chief of the Historical
                    Division, G. Bernard Noble. The volumes were compiled in the Foreign Relations
                    Branch of the Historical Division under the <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV"
                        facs="0008"/>direction of the Chief of the Branch (Editor of <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>), E. R. Perkins, and the Assistant
                    Chief of the Branch, Gustave A. Nuermberger, by a research staff consisting of
                    John G. Reid, Francis C. Prescott, Velma H. Cassidy, Herbert A. Fine, and Ralph
                    R. Goodwin. The 1942 China volume was compiled by Mr. Reid, Mr. Prescott, and
                    Mr. Goodwin.</p>
                <p>The Division of Publishing Services is responsible with respect to the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes for the proofreading and
                    editing of copy, the preparation of indexes, and the distribution of printed
                    copies. Under the general direction of the Chief of the Division, Robert L.
                    Thompson, the editorial functions mentioned above are performed by the Foreign
                    Relations Editing Branch in charge of Elizabeth A. Vary.</p>

                        exercise the supreme command over all forces of the United Powers which are
                        now or may in the future be operating in the Chinese theater, including
                        initially such portions of Indo China and Thailand as may become accessible
                        to troops of the United Powers, is one which I have considered with a full
                        sense of all the grave responsibilities it entails toward the other
                        countries and peoples concerned as well as toward China. If it were simply a
                        question of my own capacities and military qualifications, I could not
                        accept this supreme command with its attendant duties and responsibilities.
                        However, I do not hesitate to accept it at your suggestion in agreement with
                        the British and Dutch governments. The establishment of a supreme command
                        will unify the strategy and promote the full cooperation of the United
                        Powers in the Chinese theater. The effective coordination of these forces in

                        everything else. Your own initiative and efforts have brought this unity of
                        purpose and made them within reach of achievement and I shall spare myself
                        nothing to second your effort and serve the common good of all the nations
                        which are now linking to their resources at home, their communications and
                        their fighting forces on every front. This growing unity has rallied the
                        entire Chinese people behind it. In line with your suggestions I welcome the
                        prompt disposition of American and British representatives to serve on a
                        Joint Headquarters Planning Staff. The question of Russian representation
                        can be considered as <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0012"/>soon as this staff
                        has assembled and begun its duties. The proposed exchange of liaison with

                        hoped that he might have certain things like this established through a more

                            so clearly reaffirmed the consistent democratic spirit of your policy. I
                            consider that the actual incident involving the seizure of Chinese
                            lend-lease cargoes in Burma by the British military authorities is of
                            minor importance compared to the effect on the unity of our democratic
                            cause of the spirit which made such incidents possible. I trust that you
                            fully understand that my attitude in this matter has not been influenced
                            by material considerations but by political considerations which I
                            regard as being of fundamental importance.</p>
                        <p>“The spread of the Battle of the Pacific to Australasian, British and
                            Dutch territories emphasizes certain factors, the importance of which we
                            Chinese appreciate acutely. The spread of war in colonial areas differs
                            from war elsewhere, nor can the war in the Pacific today be compared
                            with the European war of 1914–1918 which hardly <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3"
                                facs="0013"/>affected the Pacific area. In Europe the military
                            factor is paramount and the conquered populations can be relied on to
                            regard the anti-Axis forces as liberators. In South East Asia however,
                            besides military factors, nationalism and social conditions are factors
                            of equal importance. Such factors may not become dangerous in a short
                            war, but with every month that passes in a long war their importance
                            increases and they may become decisive factors.</p>
                        <p>“Having been ruled for a long time by Western nations without economic,
                            social or political equality, the native populations may come to regard
                            our descriptions of the ruthlessness of the Japanese invaders as mere
                            propaganda. They may feel that there is no reason why they should
                            undergo sacrifices to defend their present rulers against other future
                            rulers. If they are to have the necessary morale to endure such
                            sacrifices as prolonged bombings and other horrors of war as we have
                            experienced in China, it is necessary that they should feel that they
                            have some national interest of their own at stake. Our experience has
                            proved that without the support of the people, armies could not maintain
                            prolonged resistance.</p>

                            Such would contribute greately towards our joint war effort. Otherwise,

                    <p>45. The Chinese press and Chinese officials with whom the Embassy is in
                        contact have reacted with greater restraint and reason than was expected to
                        the statements of Alexander<note n="12" xml:id="d4fn12">Gen. Sir Harold R.

                        placed on the European end of the Axis. They give due recognition to the
                        argument that Hitler<note n="14" xml:id="d4fn14">German Chief of State,
                            Führer, and Chancellor.</note> must be defeated and to the importance of
                        maintaining the present offensive in Europe, but they emphasize the vital
                        defensive necessity of holding Singapore and the Dutch East Indies at all
                        cost, pointing out that the Japanese in possession of those areas would be
                        in a strong position to make the War in the Pacific protracted and costly,
                        to attack Russia in eastern Siberia, and to be of considerable indirect if
                        not direct aid to Hitler or embarrassment to the Allies in the European
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>Now that the Chinese have overcome the severe shock of our initial reverses,
                        of which the fall of Hong Kong was psychologically the most serious, I feel
                        that morale has steadied. The fall of Manila and the present threat to
                        Singapore have prompted considerable press comment <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5"
                            facs="0015"/>and counsel of a military and strategic character, but I do
                        not detect any defeatist attitude.</p>
                    <p>The degree of resistance, or enthusiasm for resistance, may vary, but in the
                        light of the present situation I do not anticipate any change in the basic
                        character of the Chinese attitude. Chiang, irrevocably committed to
                        resistance, should be able to maintain his leadership. The Chinese are, of
                        course, disappointed over the prospect of a long war in the Pacific, but
                        they believe in an American victory over Japan.</p>
                    <p>Mounting economic difficulties may cause a deterioration of National
                        Government authority. The grant of a political loan or credit and its prompt
                        use in such manner as may be practical may aid in arresting such a
                        development. With both the military and the economic situation in mind, I am
                        positive that greater and more concentrated efforts should be made to move
                        Lend-Lease materials over the Burma Road. It is feasible to move such
                        materials, but this would appear to require constant and persistent efforts
                        to cause the Chinese to act.</p>

                    <p>On January 20 Mr. Currie, following a conference which he had with the
                        Secretary, called upon Mr. Hornbeck.<note n="22" xml:id="d7fn22">Stanley K.
                            Hornbeck, Adviser on Political Relations.</note> Mr. Hamilton<note

                        that he had information indicating that the Japanese have massed troops and
                        about 450 planes on the Thailand-Burma border. He referred to an estimate
                        which we had a few days ago of British origin under the heading “A Threat to
                        Burma”, in which it was pointed out that there are a number of highly
                        compelling reasons why an attack by Japan in force upon Burma is to be
                        expected. He referred to a report from General Magruder<note n="24"
                            xml:id="d7fn24">Brig. Gen. John A. Magruder, Chief of American Military
                            Mission to China.</note> that the British were apparently reluctant to
                        accept a Chinese offer to dispatch three Army corps to Burma to help defend
                        that territory against a possible Japanese attack, although they had agreed
                        to receive three Chinese regiments. He said that he had raised with the
                        Secretary the question of the desirability of inducing the British to accept
                        the Chinese offer and that the Secretary had asked him to confer with Mr.
                        Hornbeck. At the conference in Mr. Hornbeck’s room all present concurred in
                        the belief that the situation in Burma was critical and that it was even
                        possible that it might be too late to do anything.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Currie also said that he has been informed by T. V. Soong<note n="25"
                            xml:id="d7fn25">Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> that Soong
                        has received a message from his Government indicating that his Government
                        does not like the plan which was proposed to it, by the Secretary of the
                            Treasury,<note n="26" xml:id="d7fn26">Henry Morgenthau, Jr.</note>
                        through T. V. Soong. Mr. Hornbeck asked whether T. V. Soong has informed the
                        Secretary of the Treasury of that fact. Mr. Currie replied that he had not
                        yet done so.<note n="27" xml:id="d7fn27">For further correspondence on the

                    <p>After Mr. Currie left Mr. Hornbeck asked to see the Secretary.</p>
                    <p>In pursuance of Mr. Hornbeck’s request the Secretary arranged to see Messrs.
                        Hornbeck, Hamilton and Ballantine this morning. The Secretary mentioned his
                        concern over the possibility after today of German and Japanese attacks upon
                        the countries of South America and he said that he had decided to
                        communicate to the War and Navy authorities his views in regard thereto. The
                        Secretary then took up the subject of Mr. Currie’s call on the previous day.
                        He said he had tried to get in touch with the President yesterday afternoon
                        in regard to the matter, but that he had been unable to reach the President.
                        The Secretary asked why it was that the British had not accepted the Chinese
                        offer to send three Chinese Army corps to Burma. Mr. Hornbeck said that this
                        point had been discussed with Mr. Currie and that we had all felt that it
                        was due to British reluctance to accept assistance from Orientals as
                        derogatory to British prestige in Asia. In the course of discussion of this
                        subject reference was made to the precarious position of the thirty or so
                        ships at Rangoon laden with military equipment whose unloading had been held
                        up by inability to get stevedores at Rangoon to unload them and to the large
                        quantities of Lease-Lend materials at Rangoon awaiting shipment to China.
                        There was also discussed a radio report this morning of a rapid falling back
                        toward Singapore of the British lines in Malaya and the probability that the
                        mainland would soon be evacuated by the British forces.</p>
                    <p>Mention was made also of the report received by Mr. Currie from Mr. T. V.
                        Soong that the Chinese Government had reacted unfavorably to an offer of a
                        loan communicated by the Secretary of the Treasury to Mr. Soong on the
                        ground that this offer appeared to treat Chinese troops as mercenaries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hornbeck gave the Secretary a copy of a digest of an article by Mr. Paul
                        Wohl which appeared in the Baltimore <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> of January
                        18 entitled “Hub of British Empire”, and called to the Secretary’s attention
                        a memorandum<note n="28" xml:id="d7fn28">Not printed.</note> prepared in the
                        Far Eastern Division yesterday on Singapore.</p>
                    <p>During the course of the conference the Secretary telephoned the President
                        and communicated to the President (1) his concern over the possibility of
                        German and Japanese attacks upon the countries of South America; (2) the
                        critical situation in Burma as outlined above and the reported refusal of
                        the British to accept Chinese military aid; (3) the reported falling back of
                        the British in Malaya upon Singapore and (4) the report we had received of
                        adverse Chinese reaction to the offer communicated by the Secretary of the
                        Treasury to Mr. T. V. Soong. The President replied stating that he also felt
                        concern over the situation in Burma, that the report had also reached him of
                        the <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0018"/>falling back of the British upon
                        Singapore, and that he was conferring at noon today with the authorities of
                        the War and Navy Departments.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary indicated to Messrs. Hornbeck, Hamilton and Ballantine that he
                        expected to confer later on today with officials of the Army and Navy to
                        inform them of his views in regard to the possibility of German and Japanese
                        attacks upon the countries of South America and that he would on this
                        occasion also take up with them the situation in Burma and Malaya.</p>

                    <p>51. The recent United Press report of an interview with Sun Fo has not been
                        released here, but I have obtained the signed text of the interview from
                        which certain phrases, as indicated by parentheses, were deleted by the
                        censor. For instance, Dr. Sun stated, for quotation, <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“If the Allies’ policy is to remain solely on the defensive in the

                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>I do not consider that Dr. Sun’s statement is representative of general
                        China’s swelling [<hi rend="italic">feeling?</hi>] official or public (my
                        telegram No. 45, January 17, 11 a.m. gives, I think, a reasonably correct
                        account of the situation although there would seem to be evidence of
                        official desire to whip up resentment) but it cannot be overlooked that
                        responsible government authorities acquiesced in its issuance if they did
                        not actually plan it. I believe that the part which ulterior motives may
                        have played in prompting the issuance of the statement will be apparent to
                        the Department.</p>

                    <p>I saw Mr. Fisher this morning and read him the Department’s 38, January 21,

                        response to instructions from his New York office, which had requested an

                        regard to Chinese reaction to the statements by Alexander and Knox on
                        January 10 and 12, respectively.<note n="33a" xml:id="d10fn3">See telegram

                        statement from General Chiang, he had found that Dr. Sun Fo (President of
                        the Legislative Yuan) was willing to make a statement. He pointed out that
                        his report of the interview was entirely objective, containing only a
                        summary lead and the quoted statement without any expression of opinion on
                        his part.</p>
                    <p>I told him that we did not consider Sun Fo’s statement as representative of
                        general Chinese official and public opinion, and informed him of the gist of
                        our telegram no. 51, January 22, 12 noon. I said that I had been following
                        the Chinese press rather carefully and been in contact with numbers of
                        Chinese officials and that I had not detected evidence of a defeatist
                        attitude such as that in Sun Fo’s statement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Fisher said he thought the Sun Fo statement was representative of a
                        certain section of Chinese opinion, and felt its publication had been
                        beneficial in provoking reassuring statements from American officials which,
                        in turn, had caused a modification of Chinese feeling. He agreed, however,
                        that Sun Fo’s statement could not be taken as representing Chinese feeling
                        generally.</p>
                    <p>Mr. James Stewart, who was also present during the conversation, referred to
                        a story which he had sent in to <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> Magazine in
                        which he <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0020"/>had reported Chinese
                        indignation over the statements of Alexander and Knox and also indignation
                        over the manner in which the British were handling matters in Burma. He said
                        that he had quoted no officials, but said that his sources were close to the
                        Generalissimo’s headquarters.</p>
                    <p>Reference was also made during the conversation to a report sent in by
                        Reuters correspondent (Thomas Chao) which had taken the British severely to
                        task for their ineptitude and “insincerity” in providing for Far Eastern
                        defenses. (Subsequently, at the British Embassy, Sir Archibald
                            Clark-Kerr<note n="34" xml:id="d10fn4">British Ambassador in
                            China.</note> showed me a section of the Reuters report which had been
                        censored, containing a bitter and unobjective denunciation of the
                        British).</p>
                    <p>Mr. Fisher, in commenting on his interview with Dr. Sun Fo, stated that Dr.
                        Sun, before signing the prepared statement, had commented on the strength of
                        some of the language and had asked Dr. Quo Tai-chi, ex-Foreign Minister, who
                        was also present, what he thought of it. Dr. Quo replied that it looked all
                        right to him; to let it go. Dr. Sun remarked that it had a hint of blackmail
                        in it, but agreed nevertheless. The most outspoken portion was subsequently
                        deleted by the censor without prior reference back to Dr. Sun Fo.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Fisher told me that General Chiang Kai-shek was critical of the interview
                        when it was brought to his attention and that it was decided that should

                        Dr. Sun Fo would claim that he had been misquoted. (The Embassy has in its

                    <p>No. 241. On December 23rd, at a preliminary allied conference Chiang Kai Shek
                        suggested that a continuing military council be inaugurated. The council was
                        informally constituted with Ho Ying Chin<note n="38" xml:id="d12fn38">Chief
                            of Chinese General Staff and Minister of War.</note> and the Chiefs of
                        the U. S. and British Military Missions designated by the conferees as
                        representatives. It should be brought to the attention of the Secretary of
                        War and the Chief of Staff that this Chungking council meets once a week and
                        more often if necessary and is beginning to furnish excellent ways of
                        investigating preliminary problems and of forming recommendations for the
                        governments concerned or for coming to an understanding for united
                        action.</p>
                    <p>Representative of the problems considered are logistical considerations of
                        potential military action, problems which consider railway, signal and road
                        communications between India, China and Burma and retransfers of lend-lease
                        materials between Great Britain and China.</p>

                    <p>68. The Department has received through the Chinese Embassy a communication
                        from the Chinese Government requesting that the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tutuila</hi> at Chungking be assigned temporarily to the Chinese
                        Government for transport purposes during the present emergency, and <pb
                            n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0022"/>adding that the British gunboats <hi
                            rend="italic">Falcon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gannet</hi> have been
                        assigned to the Chinese Government for similar purposes.</p>
                    <p>Department understands from the Navy Department that the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tutuila</hi> has been decommissioned and that the Embassy is now using
                        a portable radio operated by naval personnel. As assumably the primary
                        usefulness of the vessel to the Embassy has been as a communications
                        station, as communication facilities can apparently be continued ashore, and
                        as there would not seem to be any practical use to which the vessel might be
                        put in the interests of this Government, there would seem to be no reason
                        for not meeting the Chinese request, if the Navy Department is agreeable to
                        doing so.</p>
                    <p>Before a decision is made in regard to the Chinese Government’s request, the
                        Department would appreciate receiving by telegram your comments and
                        recommendations.</p>

                        there is no reserve fuel supply available and the ship is small and of
                        little value for transport purposes.</p>

                    <p>We are rapidly increasing our ferry service to China via Africa and India. I
                        can now give you definite assurances that even though there should be a
                        further setback in Rangoon, which now seems improbable, the supply route to
                        China via India can be maintained by air.</p>
                    <p>The whole plan seems altogether practical and I am sure we can make it a

                    <p>No. 256 <hi rend="smallcaps">Ammisca</hi>. It is a known fact that the
                        Chinese are great believers in the world of make-believe, and that they
                        frequently shut their eyes to hard and unpleasant actualities, preferring
                        rather to indulge their fancy in flattering but fictitious symbols, which
                        they regard as more real than cold facts. Manifestations of this national
                            <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0024"/>escape-psychology have been
                        clearly discernible in China’s international relations. She has consciously
                        given free rein to her native penchant for alluring fiction in Chinese
                        propaganda abroad. People in other countries swallow such glib untruths
                        whole without realizing that they are being deceived. As instances of this
                        deceptive symbolism, I may adduce many reports emanating from Chinese
                        diplomatic sources abroad, referring to the marvelous achievements and
                        abilities of the Chinese Army. Such reports are absolutely without
                        foundation. They are largely due to the above-mentioned Chinese love of
                        symbolism, or else can be attributed to nothing other than a downright
                        desire to achieve certain specific objectives by clever deception.</p>
                    <p>Such a spirit of Chinese symbolism is deep-rooted in the United States,
                        mainly because of Chinese propagandists in America, and because of the
                        sponsorship accorded such propaganda on the part of many outstanding
                        individuals, including missionaries as well as adherents to radical and
                        liberal viewpoints. This propaganda has influenced public opinion in the
                        United States, usually so sane and well-informed, to a surprising extent.
                        The realization of its falsity would undoubtedly result in the lessening of
                        positive American support for Chinese projects that are devoid of any sound
                        justification, even if it did not result in a weakening of the emotional
                        appeal which China has always held for a great many Americans, many of them
                        veterans in things Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Chinese officials demand such impossible quantities and such impractical
                        varieties of arms and munitions that they are fast becoming a headache to
                        deal with. Over and over again they recommend that air activity be carried
                        on with Chinese landing-fields as bases. When they are politely told that no
                        adequate transportation facilities are available for handling even a slight
                        fraction of the tonnage needed for such air activity, they refuse to change
                        their minds. They are unwelcome to any helpful suggestions about even the
                        simplest methods of increasing the available rolling tonnage over
                        present-day roads, yet at the same time they continually demand aid for
                        projects that are unnecessary and chimerical. They know little or nothing
                        about ships and maritime matters, such as the meaning of turn-around and the
                        limitations imposed by floating tonnage.</p>
                    <p>It is true that Japan’s occupancy of China has for her the disadvantage of
                        keeping her occupying forces away from other theaters of war, but
                        nevertheless this military drawback is fairly well offset by advantages of
                        the economic order. The Nipponese forces in China are given no trouble at
                        all, except in places where they wish to repress guerillas from roaming
                        around in quest of political or economic gain. It is foolish to label the
                        reoccupation by Chinese forces of territory voluntarily evacuated by the
                        Japs as a smashing victory for China. <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0025"
                        />The American press has given absolutely disproportionate prominence to
                        trivial engagements between Chinese and Nipponese forces.</p>
                    <p>Contrast such propaganda with the true picture. Japan has the best parts of
                        China, including all of the seaports, under her own control. To maintain
                        this control it is estimated that she maintains twenty-eight Japanese
                        divisions (most of them inferior) in China. Some of these divisions are kept
                        there for the purpose of handling any trouble on the Soviet front.</p>
                    <p>All that China says about her being unable to inaugurate an offensive on a
                        large scale is quite true, because of the fact that she lacks the proper
                        weapons for offense. However, she herself is to blame for her failure to
                        carry on a successful program of annoyance and attrition. The reasons for
                        this failure are found in her own lack of aggressiveness and initiative, and
                        in the age-long practice of Chinese commanding officers of regarding their
                        soldiers as static assets, to be conserved for assistance in fighting
                        against their fellow-countrymen for economic and political supremacy.</p>
                    <p>Our extensions of credit and shipments of matériel to China have to a great
                        extent given the lie to certain accusations hitherto leveled at us in some
                        international circles. However, such assistance, no matter how great, is not
                        to be regarded as having added substantially to China’s striking-power. The
                        brunt of any offensive warfare in China must be borne by foreign troops sent
                        there by Allied powers, and the only thing which we can with any confidence
                        expect from the large resources of Chinese manpower is that they occupy
                        areas evacuated by the enemy and consolidate advances won by others.</p>
                    <p>These remarks must not be construed to mean that I am against our lease-lend
                        policy with regard to China. On the contrary, I am as much in favor of this
                        policy as ever, mainly because of the foreseen positive benefits that are
                        ultimately going to result from it. Some of these positive benefits are: the
                        maintenance of Chiang Kai-shek in power; the preservation of a spirit of at
                        least silent opposition on the part of China’s multitudes, and the
                        possibility of employing Chinese landing-fields as air bases for bombing
                        Japan.</p>
                    <p>Some radio broadcasts heard from San Francisco’s KGEI give me great cause for
                        alarm. If they are at all typical, the true state of affairs in China is
                        being seriously distorted, and China’s military successes are being highly
                        exaggerated, by what is given out in American newspapers and over American
                        broadcasting stations. There is grave danger that such continued distortions
                        of fact as to the prowess of China’s military forces are spreading about a
                        false sense of security on the part of the rank and file in the United
                        States, and even on the part of Chinese officials themselves. It is highly
                        possible that such propaganda could lead to grave defects in American war
                        plans, if our <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0026"/>own officials should be
                        influenced by it even to the slightest extent. Perhaps all this is designed
                        to raise popular morale in the United States and to flatter the Chinese. If
                        so, it is going a bit too far.</p>
                    <p>An attitude of mind which, if not checked, is liable to spread in China and
                        to become positively dangerous to us is indicated by the childish
                        displeasure evidenced by high-ranking Chinese officials at a general
                        statement recently issued by Secretary Knox.</p>
                    <p>Chiang Kai-shek can be expected neither to abdicate of his own free will nor
                        to be ousted without a fight. He is a remarkable figure. It is due almost to
                        his influence alone that the Chinese are held together as a nation. We
                        should support him to the full, but yet be ready to oppose and temper his
                        frequently exorbitant demands with prudence and intelligence. He can well be
                        reminded that China, which has more than any other nation to lose if Japan
                        wins the war, is putting out the least war-effort of all the Allies. Her
                        contribution to the military strength of our Allied forces has been grossly
                        exaggerated in propaganda emanating from both American and Chinese sources.
                        Such a misconception as to the part China can accurately be expected to play
                        in this war may harm us greatly if our own war plans are based at all
                        substantially on any such exaggerated expectations. We shall consequently
                        have to do away with all sham and pretense in our future discussions with
                        Chinese officials concerning China’s position in our collective
                        war-strategy.</p>

                    <p>The Minister of the Netherlands<note n="44" xml:id="d19fn44">A.
                            Loudon.</note> asked to see me urgently this evening in order that he
                        might read to me a telegram he had received <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17"
                            facs="0027"/>under date of February 11 from the Governor General of the
                        Netherlands East Indies.</p>
                    <p>The Minister emphasized that this message undoubtedly had been sent by the
                        Governor General after the latter had conferred with General Wavell.</p>
                    <p>The substance of the message was as follows:</p>
                    <p>The attitude of China was altogether unsatisfactory. In December the Chinese
                        Government had offered the Allied Governments two army corps and one army
                        corps had been accepted by the Allied Governments. Since that time only part
                        of one army corps had been placed by China at the disposal of the
                        Inter-Allied Command.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding, the Chinese Government was still complaining that its offer
                        of help had been refused by the Allies.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the lack of any action by the Chinese Government against the
                        Japanese in China, Japan had been enabled to take out of China five
                        divisions of Chinese [<hi rend="italic">Japanese?</hi>] troops.</p>
                    <p>The Governor General of the Netherlands East Indies understands that China
                        has no idea of undertaking any large offensive before the Allied Governments
                        undertake a major offensive.</p>
                    <p>In his judgment China has more than sufficient means to undertake an
                        offensive but wishes to wait until the end of the war “probably for
                        political reasons”.</p>
                    <p>I told the Minister that I would communicate this information to the
                        President for such disposition of it as he might determine.<note n="45"

                            <p>Mr. Welles forwarded this memorandum to President Roosevelt in a

                        Kunming as Consul, designation as Second Secretary for temporary duty at
                        Chungking, and detail to the American military mission under command of
                        Major General Stilwell for certain liaison duties.</p>
                    <p>Previous instructions to you on this subject are hereby supplemented as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>It is understood that the liaison duties for the military mission for which
                        you are detailed are to be undertaken by you at the direction and under the
                        supervision of General Stilwell. As a Foreign Service Officer, and
                        especially as a member of the staff of the American Embassy in China, the
                        Department desires that when in China you in so far as practicable keep the
                        American Ambassador to China and through him the Department adequately
                        informed in regard to the activities of the military mission in so far as
                        those activities are appropriately of interest to the Department and the
                        Embassy. When on duty with the military mission at points outside of China,
                        please endeavor to follow a similar procedure with regard to the senior
                        Foreign Service officer stationed in the area.</p>

                    <p>Reference the telegraphic report, no. 256 <hi rend="smallcaps">Ammisca</hi>,
                        from the Magruder Mission, Chungking, China, of February 10, 1942.</p>
                    <p>The writer of the report under reference does not, in my opinion, present his
                        facts in accurate perspective.</p>
                    <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0029"/>
                    <p>Some of the statements as to fact are accurate. Some of the statements as to
                        fact reflect an attitude of a person who is too close to unpleasant detail
                        and who has forgotten or overlooked broader aspects. Also, the report omits
                        statements as to a number of significant facts.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese have fought for four and one-half years. They have suffered
                        tremendously in blood, in treasure, in forced removal from their accustomed
                        homes. They have done some remarkably good fighting and some remarkably
                        heroic things. The fact that they have kept going along in the face of what
                        they have suffered is the most remarkable development of the last few years
                        in the Far East.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese, like the people of any other country old in historic experience,
                        are adept in pitting one foreign nation against another and in endeavoring
                        to cause foreign nations to fight China’s battles. There is much of
                        inefficiency in present-day China—as there has been for centuries. There is
                        undoubted incompetence. There is undoubted confusion. But, there is a real
                        spirit of nationalism. There is also in present-day China something of a
                        renaissance of spirit flowing from China’s contacts with the Occident,
                        principally its contacts with the United States. There is also an awareness
                        of what Japanese mastery of China will mean to the Chinese people. There is
                        thus amongst all the shortcomings a spirit striving toward liberty.</p>
                    <p>There is, moreover,—and this the Magruder Mission’s report under reference
                        emphasizes—the person of Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek’s determination,
                        his persistence, his on the whole broad-gauge outlook constitute perhaps the
                        most important element in China as a fighting ally.</p>
                    <p>On the spirit of liberty which is still alive in China and on Chiang Kai-shek
                        it is believed that the United States should continue to build. No early and
                        great offensive by China is to be expected. The Chinese probably lack the
                        spirit, and they certainly lack the matériel (air force, artillery, et
                        cetera) to undertake any large-scale and real offensive <hi rend="italic">at
                            this time.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Modern-day China represents a mass movement of people led by a great leader.
                        It is on this that the United States should build and it is believed that,
                        while such building will require time, patience, and great effort in many
                        fields on our part, China can constitute a valued and effective ally in the
                        common war effort.</p>

                            peculiarly ‘sour’ telegram which General Magruder sent the War
                            Department under date February [10–] 12, I would suggest that you also
                            have this subject in mind when next you talk with General Marshall and
                            Admiral Stark.”</note>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Welles</hi>: Reference, your memorandum of
                        conversation with the Netherlands Minister, on February 12, subject of which
                        was Chinese attitude regarding war.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the message from the Governor General of the Netherlands East
                        Indies the substance of which was as outlined in your memorandum:</p>
                    <p>Is it to be wondered that the Chinese Government has not rushed into
                        offensive military operations? Should it not be remembered that Chiang
                        Kai-shek has for four and one-half years successfully carried on defensive
                        operations which most of the military experts of practically all of the
                        other powers (including Japan) thought and said at the outset and at
                        intervals could not be continued beyond a few weeks or at the utmost a few
                        months; that throughout that period Chiang Kai-shek has begged the powers to
                        give him equipment; that neither the British nor the Dutch gave him, until
                        they themselves were drawn into war in the Far East, anything; that but for
                        Russian and American aid, Chiang would have had nothing from outside; that
                        Russian and American aid have never, even to this day, reached large
                        proportions—on a comparative basis; that Chiang has not today the airplanes
                        or the artillery that are needed for the prosecution of a strong offensive
                        movement; that Chiang sees the United States, Great Britain and the Dutch
                        strictly on the defensive in the Far East; that Chiang has been foremost
                        among the now associated military leaders in urging prompt coordination of
                        effort; that Chiang has seen, even as the Dutch have seen, the United States
                        and Great Britain assuming a position of somewhat dictatorial superiority in
                        the United Nations councils; that Chiang has reason to believe that his
                        military judgment is at least as good as that of any of the British or
                        American generals and admirals (with the possible exception of MacArthur)
                        who have thus far been put to test in the matter of operations during recent
                        years; and that Chiang is just as much entitled and just as well qualified
                        to play national interest politics in connection with allied strategy as are
                        responsible leaders of any other of the allied nations.</p>
                    <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0031"/>
                    <p>To speak of “the lack of any action by the Chinese Government against the
                        Japanese in China” is to talk nonsense. While doubtless it is true that the
                        recent Chinese victory at Changsha was not as glorious as Chinese reports
                        would indicate, that victory also was a good deal more substantial than some
                        of the foreign military critics are now making it appear to have been: it
                        was substantial enough to have convinced the responsible Japanese general
                        that he had suffered a defeat sufficient to call for his committing
                        hara-kiri; it does constitute the only case in which one of the fighting
                        members of the United Nations group has definitely repulsed a substantial
                        Japanese offensive during the warfare of the past ten weeks.</p>
                    <p>The idea that “China has more than sufficient means to undertake an offensive
                        but wishes to wait until the end of the war ‘probably for political
                        reasons’” is open to a good deal of easy refutation. China is definitely
                        short on means for a large-scale offensive. Yet, China has indicated
                        willingness to give support—at various times and for various theaters of
                        operations; the British rejected Chinese offers in connection with Hong Kong
                        and in connection with the Malay Peninsula until too late; the British have
                        been reluctant to accept Chinese aid in connection with Burma; and there is
                        no indication that in the allied councils there has been given any
                        encouragement to the Chinese idea of a Chinese invasion of Indochina.</p>
                    <p>Chiang Kai-shek knows perfectly well that the recognition which the powers
                        other than Russia and the United States have given to his efforts,
                        recognition given only since December 7, is a recognition which arises out
                        of the realization by those powers of their own needs and not out of
                        overwhelming sympathy by those powers for the cause of defending China’s
                        sovereignty and independence. Chiang probably sees no good reason why he
                        should launch an offensive for which he is not prepared while the other
                        powers do not launch offensives for which they are not prepared. Chiang no
                        more desires to tempt Japanese bombing planes to begin again their brutal
                        hammering of China than we have to tempt them to begin a bombing of the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese at least have a record of having “taken it” for four and one-half
                        years and having destroyed a million Japanese and having absorbed 25 billion
                        yen of Japanese expenditure on war effort.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the above, I call attention to expository paragraphs in
                        Hugh Byas’ <hi rend="italic">The Japanese Enemy</hi>, and to a brief
                        memorandum of today’s date<note n="48" xml:id="d23fn48">Not found in
                            Department files.</note> in which I have commented on and copied a few
                        statements from that book. Note especially Mr. Byas’ statement that “Realism
                        might begin by dropping the fiction that China can give us substantial
                        military help at present. Chiang Kai-shek is pinned in his remote northern
                        hinterland by superior Japanese forces. <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22"
                            facs="0032"/>He cannot defeat them until he gets the planes, tanks, and
                        guns needed. This does not minimize his heroism or the strength of his
                        resistance. It has been a magnificent feat, but it has consisted in
                        harassing the Japanese army along their extended lines and refusing them the
                        orderly occupation in which they could sit down and exploit their gains.
                        Later, when the Japanese line begins to sag and break everywhere, it will
                        break in China also.”</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to find that coinciding in time with the coming of this
                        complaint from the Dutch, with an implication that General Wavell concurs,
                        there has come into the War Department, under date Chungking February 10, a
                        long telegram from General Magruder heartily “damning” Chinese mentality and
                        deeds in so far as military activities are concerned. Still more
                        interesting, however, is the fact that, in the course of this over-all
                        “damning”, General Magruder makes a statement which in effect flatly
                        contradicts the Dutch contention that the Chinese are equipped for an
                        offensive. General Magruder says: “All that China says about her being
                        unable to inaugurate an offensive on a large scale is quite true, because of
                        the fact that she lacks the proper weapons for offense. However, she herself
                        is to blame for her failure to carry on a successful program of annoyance
                        and attrition.”</p>

                    <p>Reference is made to the Chinese Embassy’s memorandum of January 27, 1942
                        with regard to the proposed transfer of the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tutuila</hi> to the Chinese Government for transport purposes during
                        the present emergency.</p>
                    <p>The Department has now received a communication from the Navy Department
                        indicating that the Navy Department is agreeable to the transfer to the
                        Chinese Government not only of the vessel itself but also of its stores and
                        equipment and that the Navy Department is initiating action to effect such
                        transfer under the terms of “Defense Aid”. It is understood that there is no
                        other available method of transfer without obtaining additional specific
                        legislative authority.</p>
                    <p>It is requested that until the transfer is actually effected and the vessel
                        is taken over by the Chinese Government the matter of the transfer be
                        considered as confidential.</p>

                    <p>141. Reference Department’s No. 110, February 17, 6 p.m. Magruder showed me
                        his telegram on February 15. A proper evaluation of China’s military effort
                        requires a sober estimate of what we may reasonably expect from China in
                        this direction. I have repeatedly pointed out that China is not prepared
                        physically or psychologically to participate on a major scale in this war,
                        that the Chinese armies do not possess the supplies, equipment, or
                        aggressive spirit for any major military offensives or expeditions, and that
                        we should not expect from them more than a continuance of their past
                        resistance to Japan. It would indeed by [<hi rend="italic">be</hi>] unwise
                        to count on more than that, whatever assurances or offers of greater
                        cooperation may be forthcoming. In this connection see my telegrams No. 384,

                    </p>
                    <p>It is true that the Chinese have made extravagant requests under the
                        Lend-Lease program and that they have exploited the existing situation in
                        their recent request for a huge loan. It is also true that China is not now
                        making any all-out war effort on the military front; that the Chinese armies
                        probably could do more by way of local offensives, harassing tactics against
                        the enemy, and constant attacks on lines of communication and supply. I have
                        for some time been of the opinion that Chinese reserves of supplies and
                        ammunition are limited to a point where the high command does not wish to
                        undertake extended activity until reasonably certain of its permanent
                        effectiveness. The time may come when we may have to do some “plain
                        thinking” but I believe that in the present circumstances we will accomplish
                        more if we seek our ends by constant and realistic but tactful persuasion,
                        remembering that the Chinese feel that they have sustained a patient
                        resistance over long years.</p>
                    <p>The Generalissimo, in my opinion, is irrevocably committed to the policy of
                        continued resistance to Japan and I do not believe that he could be
                        supplanted or persuaded to stand aside to permit others to stand on that
                        policy except under most extraordinary circumstances.</p>
                    <p>It is unfortunate that he seems in a measure to have lost his direct <pb
                            n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0035"/>and active interest in military
                        affairs in recent years and to have acquired a touch of unreality derived
                        from a somewhat grandiose or “ivory tower” conception of his and China’s
                        role in world affairs but we must take him with his weaknesses as well as
                        his strength as the only person capable of maintaining China’s resistance to
                        Japan in the present conflict. We must also take China as she is with all
                        her faults and shortcomings.</p>
                    <p>I agree that the American press has unwisely accepted and exaggerated Chinese
                        propaganda reports of alleged military successes which with the exception of
                        the Japanese reverse at Changsha have little foundation in fact or are
                        distortions of minor skirmishes or Japanese withdrawals and it is true that
                        American and other radio commentators and editorial writers are
                        over-emphasizing the military potentialities of China’s great manpower. I
                        have confidence that this propaganda will not be permitted to affect
                        American military planning to our future detriment. But I agree that all
                        this fulsome praise of China’s war effort may have the effect not only of
                        intoxicating the Chinese with ideas of their own prowess over the past years
                        in comparison with the military ability of the United Nations in Hong Kong,
                        Malaya, Burma and the Netherland Indies, but also of inducing a greater
                        complacency as to any vital need for real military effort on China’s part at
                        this time. I have recently approved and transmitted through the Department
                        several messages to the Coordinator of Information,<note n="56"

                    <p>194. Summary of significant events in China since the outbreak of the Pacific
                        War.</p>
                    <p>On December 8, the Generalissimo proposed to America, Britain and Russia a
                        joint front against Japan and an Allied Supreme Command centering at
                        Chungking. On December 9 China declared war on Japan and also declared that
                        a state of war existed with Germany and Italy. The Chinese press, echoing
                        the official feeling, urged Russian entrance into conflict with Japan. At
                        the end of December <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0036"/>Generals Wavell

                        Subsequently Chiang accepted the post of Supreme Commander for Allied forces
                        operating in China and border regions of Indochina and Thailand. Chinese
                        troops, numbering about 50,000, have been sent to participate in the defense
                        of Burma. Early in February General Chiang, his wife and staff members
                        visited India via Burma, returning to Chungking March 5.<note n="58"

                    </p>
                    <p>Aside from the successful repulse of the Japanese attack on Changsha at the
                        beginning of January, there has been no military activity in China of note
                        since war began. Chinese forces were unable to organize an offensive in time
                        to relieve Hong Kong. Chinese military operations, much overplayed in the
                        press, have been confined to minor clashes and to occupation of areas
                        evacuated by the Japanese.</p>
                    <p>The authorities conservatively estimated that Japanese troops in China proper
                        have been reduced from 37 to 28 divisions. There has been little evidence as
                        yet that the Chinese are taking advantage of this weakening of the Japanese
                        position. The American volunteer aviation group under Colonel Chennault<note

                        remarkably fine record and impression.</p>
                    <p>Kuomintang-Communist relations have been quiescent during the period under

                        strengthened conservative party control.</p>
                    <p>In the economic finance field, interest has centered around the large
                        American and British credits, granted to China in February and the manner in
                        which they will be employed. Currency inflation, with resultant price rises,
                        hoarding, and speculation continue to be a major concern. A “commodities
                        administration” has been established with a view to stabilizing prices and
                        attacking the hoarding situation. A new land administration has been set up
                        ostensibly as a preparation for dealing with land problem. Past experience
                        does not make for optimism with regard to the success of these
                        organizations, but there is some reason for hope that in present
                        circumstances they may attack the problems more resolutely. There are
                        indications that the American credit might be effectively employed as an aid
                        toward solving these problems and to stimulating production of consumption
                        goods as well as to attack the currency inflation situation.</p>

                    <p>195. Following comment is submitted in continuation of my No. 194 of March 6,
                        3 p.m.</p>
                    <p>The situation in China is not bright but it is not necessarily discouraging
                        if judged with a sympathetic understanding of the Chinese and bearing in
                        mind the limitations on what we may reasonably expect from this country.</p>
                    <p>Continued United Nation reverses in the Pacific undoubtedly give support to
                        those who would seek an understanding with the Japanese. Should Burma fall
                        to Japan and China become isolated, a passive attitude of wait and see might
                        conceivably develop in that country especially if the Japanese did not
                        resume military pressure against China. An undeclared peace involving
                        virtual cessation of hostilities and a gradual breakdown of trade and other
                        barriers between occupied and unoccupied China is a possibility which should
                        not be ignored.</p>
                    <p>China is to us a minor asset at this time. Our task is to prevent her
                        becoming a liability and to raise the value of the asset so far as possible,
                        to encourage resistance and to increase its effectiveness. We should seek to
                        maintain Chinese confidence in our ultimate victory and cultivate Chinese
                        consciousness of their position as co-equal partners in the war and a
                        realization that their national interest lies in our common victory.</p>
                    <p>The recent American loan if properly utilized can strengthen China’s economic
                        and financial structure and the more widely dispersed the benefits from the
                        loan the more substantial will be the desired effect.</p>
                    <p>Military assistance particularly in aviation would have a psychological
                        effect perhaps greater than the military benefit. The presence of an
                        American military mission in China is not enough. American air forces even
                        though limited would give China positive evidence that we are fighting
                        together for the Chinese as well as ourselves. The successes of the American
                        volunteer group in Yunnan and Burma have had a splendid effect on Chinese
                        morale and if later this group moves to Chungking it will have a substantial
                        effect on the morale here which many observers insist is lower than
                        elsewhere in Free China. The strength of the American volunteer group in
                        personnel and equipment should be maintained and gradually increased whether
                        or not the unit is incorporated into the United States Army.</p>
                    <p>Efforts should be continued to send supplies to the Chinese armies; but we
                        should not expect those armies to carry out major offensives <pb n="28"
                            xml:id="pg_28" facs="0038"/>under present circumstances. It has been
                        unfortunate that the press and other publicity organs recently have been
                        overplaying Chinese military activity and prowess.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Armies have a very definite utility which should be encouraged by
                        practical operations within the limit of their capabilities and full credit
                        should be given when it is due; but exaggeration of China’s military
                        strength encourages complacency and invites ill-founded and detrimental
                        comparison with other military forces.</p>
                    <p>The program of the Cultural Relations Division of the Department<note n="61"
                            xml:id="d30fn61">See <ref target="#pg_697">pp. 697</ref> ff.</note> can
                        contribute toward encouraging a friendly relationship in special groups,
                        particularly the educational group.</p>
                    <p>The Information Service of the Coordinator of Information can also be most
                        helpful. I suggest that its primary objective should be the prompt
                        dissemination of straightforward factual news devoid of obvious propaganda.
                        This applies to radio broadcasts and news services and also to the selection
                        of printed material for dissemination in China. Since the Chinese withdrawal
                        to Western China there has been a dearth of those American periodicals and
                        publications through which intelligent Chinese kept abreast of American
                        opinion and activity, and this situation is now aggravated by the
                        non-receipt of any American mails of any class. I urge that there be no
                        transport priority for propaganda material for China over regular mails and
                        periodicals and that the transmission of periodicals be emphasized as a
                        major effort of the Information Service to give the Chinese not propaganda
                        material but the publications upon which they have for some years relied for
                        their contact with American life and opinion. Even limited numbers of copies
                        of such periodicals as <hi rend="italic">Time, Newsweek, Reader’s Digest,
                            Life, The New Republic, Foreign Affairs</hi> and the Weekly News summary
                        sections found in metropolitan papers such as the <hi rend="italic">New York
                            Times</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Daily News</hi> et cetera
                        would be most useful for distribution to those groups which form or
                        influence in a large degree such public opinion as exists in this
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Basically, I believe that most intelligent Chinese have confidence in an
                        American victory and in China’s interest to aid it. Dissident and doubting
                        elements can best be neutralized, and those sincerely desirous of full
                        cooperation in the war can be encouraged, by making it constantly clear that
                        frustration of Japaneses ambitions is a common objective with positive ends
                        worth fighting for—a free and cooperative Far East which will gain and give
                        benefit in a social organization which respects national integrities but
                        expects and stipulates collaboration in the interest of all peoples.</p>

                    <p>I have given careful study to your message of March 10<note n="63"
                            xml:id="d31fn63">This message proposed General Stilwell as commander in
                            Burma.</note> and appreciate the circumstances that have prompted your
                        proposal. Since General Stilwell is an officer of the United States Army you
                        will understand that the matter is one of extreme delicacy, particularly
                        because, from this distance, it is most difficult for the British and
                        ourselves to visualize the details of the tactical situation. However, one
                        of the reasons that I directed General Stilwell, a senior and extremely able
                        officer, to report to you was because I anticipated the occurrence in the
                        Burma area of difficult problems in cooperation and coordination involving
                        United States munitions, British units and the Chinese Army. Since the
                        British Chiefs of Staff were fully acquainted with and approved General
                        Stilwell’s directive and purposes, it was my earnest hope that he would be
                        able, on the ground, to find an acceptable solution to these problems,
                        particularly whenever British forces and commanders were involved. I should
                        like to request, therefore, that in the knowledge that General Stilwell
                        possesses my confidence, you will accord to him full opportunity to work out
                        this most delicate matter without involving a necessity of placing the
                        question before the British Government.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, I know that you will devote your maximum effort to the task
                        of meeting the enemy and opposing his advance with every available unit at
                        your disposal. I assure you that this Government is proceeding vigorously to
                        find practicable ways and means of continuing its support to you, and has no
                        intention of relaxing its efforts merely because the route from Rangoon has
                        been interrupted. I feel sure that General Stilwell will be able to arrange
                        a command set up satisfactory to you and that, moreover, he will find
                        methods for assuring the continuity of U. S. supply to you and your Army. I
                        realize that this may sound a little like temporizing on my part but I know
                        you understand my problem of being so far away from the field of action.
                        Confidentially I wish you would explore the possibility of Chinese command
                        under you and General Stilwell in North Burma and British defense further
                        south. This will give the British the chance to cover the approaches to
                        India.</p>

                            Affairs, dated April 6, 1942, Chungking: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                <p>“In the first instance, a quantity of wheat grains was dropped by
                                    Japanese planes over Ningpo on October 27th, 1940. An epidemic
                                    broke out soon after and lasted thirty-four days claiming
                                    ninety-nine victims. Diagnosis of plague was definitely
                                    confirmed in laboratory test. On October 4th, 1940, a Japanese
                                    plane scattered rice and wheat grains and fleas over Chusien,
                                    Chekiang. Bubonic plague appeared thirty-eight days later
                                    causing twenty-one deaths. Kinghwa was attacked by three
                                    Japanese planes on November 18th, 1940, dropping a large
                                    quantity of translucent granules like shrimp-eggs. Microscopic
                                        <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0041"/>examination revealed
                                    the presence of plague bacilli though no epidemic resulted. On
                                    November 4, 1941, a Japanese plane visited Changteh, Hunan,
                                    dropping rice, paper and cotton wads on which bacilli were
                                    found. Later nine cases of plague were reported. Numerous
                                    circumstantial evidences including infected rats proved beyond
                                    doubt the origin of the epidemic. Lastly, a serious attack of
                                    plague has broken out in Suiyuan, Ninghsia, and Shensi. Six
                                    hundred cases were reported. A recent communiqué from local
                                    military authorities stated that a large number of sick rodents
                                    was set free by the enemy there.”</p>

                    <p>The following information was received from the Naval Attaché at
                        Chungking:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Central News</hi> with Washington date line of April 12th
                        quoted Hon. Warren Robinson Austin, Senator from Vermont, as urging the
                        United States redouble efforts to supply China with critical military
                        equipment as quickest means of striking Axis while Allies marshal forces in
                        the Pacific offensive. Frequent public utterances similar to this uttered by
                        prominent individuals lately suggests widespread belief in potentiality of
                        China as an active military factor in defeating Japan. If such conception is
                        seriously held by those controlling high strategy it is fatally defective.
                        It is highly desirable to continue to encourage China to maintain morale but
                        there should be no illusions as to practical aspects as to actual situation.
                        Lack of China’s offensive spirit, physical and political, difficulties of
                        transportation were continuously reported before the fall of Rangoon. The
                        present situation is far worse. She is now completely cut off from supplies.
                        Routes to India only projected and may never be built due deteriorating
                        situation in Burma. Little hope offered by reopening latter area by counter
                        attack due complete defection of population. The Generalissimo’s
                        determination to continue to resist is shown by his interest in new routes
                        through Central Asia but such roads offer small hope of delivery effective
                        quantities of supplies. The simple truth is that we will be well on way
                        toward defeating Japan by the time lines can be opened for delivery in real
                        quantity.</p>

                    <p>“I have recently learned from General Stilwell that a special aircraft
                        project which we have had under way for some time and which will involve a
                        landing at one of your fields had not been completely coordinated with your
                        desires. I want personally to express to you my deep regret that this matter
                        was not brought to your attention in detail, at its inception. The necessity
                        for secrecy has made me reluctant to discuss the subject by radio but I
                        assumed that you had been completely informed by one of our Air officers
                        formerly serving in China. The President is fully appreciative of your
                        difficult situation and is particularly anxious that all our operations in
                        your region be under your complete control and in conformity with your
                        desires. Since he has learned that you consider the execution of this
                        mission undesirable at this time he would be very glad to cancel it if this
                        were possible and he regrets that he cannot now do so because of the
                        imminence of execution. He is therefore especially grateful to you for the
                        very effective measures you have directed to be taken to make the venture a
                        success. I take this opportunity to assure you that in the future no U. S.
                        Army effort will be undertaken in your theatre until I have received
                        definite evidence that you approve in every respect. I hope that a
                        considerable proportion of the airplanes involved will successfully complete
                        the mission and thereafter be available, under General Stilwell’s direction,
                        to participate in U. S. air operations in India and China so as to support
                        the magnificent effort you are making. By every means possible we are
                        attempting to rush air support to that important region.</p>

                        moment a declaration of China’s attitude towards Thailand emphasizing these
                        points. First, the Allied Nations believe that Thailand’s conclusion of

                        States were done under Japanese <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0043"

                        cherish no malice or enmity toward the people of Thailand. When opportunity
                        offers, they will help the people of Thailand to remove Japanese oppression.
                        Second, the Allied Nations have no territorial designs at Thailand nor
                        cherish any desire to impair her independence. Third, the Allied Nations
                        hope that the people of Thailand will not be the tool of Japan, as nothing
                        but Allied victory will ensure sovereignty and territorial integrity of
                        Thailand.</p>

                    <p>With what has been happening lately, I am afraid you could no longer avoid
                        having a frank heart-to-heart talk with the President, which I am sure he
                        will not misunderstand. As you know, I have to fight continually against
                        demoralizing doubts on the part of my officers, who conclude that American
                        attitude towards China is in essence no different from that held by other
                        nations, that both in the all-important matters of joint-staff conferences
                        and war supplies, China is treated not as an equal like Britain and Russia,
                        but as a ward.</p>
                    <p>The President has consistently shown himself to be the one great friend of
                        China, and I may say on our part we have been loyally responsive. We have
                        placed Chinese armies under American command, and we have shown every
                        readiness to support American policies, sometimes even against our own
                        judgment. All that we have and all that we are, we truly and unreservedly
                        contribute to the cause of the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>What a contrast this is to the attitude of the British and Russians who,
                        whenever it concerns their own interests, will not make concessions in the
                        general interest, so that to this day they will not concede to the United
                        States the direction and the location of the Supreme Military Council. The
                        result of this non-cooperation is that there is in existence no organization
                        to formulate and execute over-all strategy, and every country looks to its
                        own immediate interests, so that the Axis is successfully imposing its grand
                        strategy. What a difference there is between our attitude towards the United
                        States and that of Britain and Russia!</p>
                    <p>If in future the Anglo-American joint staff is not enlarged to include China,
                        and China is kept out of the Munitions Assignments Board, then China would
                        be just a pawn in the game. Gandhi told me <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34"

                        Indians as equals; why, they do not even admit your country to their staff
                        talks.” If we are thus treated during the stress of war, what becomes our
                        position at the peace conference? You must insist that we have our own
                        stand, and we have our own independent position to uphold.</p>

                    <p>465. In press interview Director of the Foreign Office Information Department
                        stated that the United States has given many evidences <pb n="35"

                        to put the defeat of Hitler before everything but it is equally natural that
                        China, the United States and other nations bordering on the Pacific should
                        regard the defeat of Japan as their most important role and logical

                            xml:id="d41fn69">Not printed.</note> bearing the headline “Close
                        Friendly Bonds Between China and Britain”, and referring to the recent

                        other Chinese officers.</p>
                    <p>This report is a virtual translation of an editorial appearing on the same
                        day in the Chungking <hi rend="italic">Central Daily News</hi>. Both the <hi

                            Daily News</hi> are official organs of the Kuomintang: and it may be
                        assumed that the article and the publicity given to it are officially
                        inspired. Any doubt that this is so would seem to be removed by the fact
                        that when the American News broadcaster of the Kuomintang Publicity Board
                        omitted mention of the article in his evening round-up on the day of its
                        publication, he received within ten minutes an urgent telephone call from
                        the Board insisting that he include adequate comment on the article in his
                        broadcast for abroad.</p>
                    <p>This Embassy has from time to time in recent months reported the critical
                        tone of the Chinese press and public opinion toward Great Britain since the
                        fall of Hong Kong. This criticism has become more outspoken with the
                        successive British defeats in Singapore and Burma and has received fresh
                        material with the arrival of large numbers of Chinese refugees from Hong
                        Kong and other occupied British territories.</p>
                    <p>Even high officials of the Chinese Government, such as the Vice Minister of
                        Foreign Affairs,<note n="70" xml:id="d41fn70">Foo Ping-sheung.</note> Party
                        officials, such as the Chief of the Overseas Board, and persons of the
                        position of Madame Chiang Kai-shek have made in private conversations with
                        me and members of the Embassy staff, embarrassingly frank derogatory
                        statements concerning the British.</p>
                    <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0046"/>
                    <p>Comment in the press has been somewhat more controlled. Semiofficial papers,
                        such as the Army paper <hi rend="italic">Sao Tang Pao</hi>, have for the
                        most part confined their discussion of what they consider British failings
                        to strategical considerations. But the <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi>
                        created a sensation by publishing on January 29 an article by its General
                        Manager, who had escaped from Hong Kong, saying bluntly that the British had
                        made no real resistance there. The <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao’s</hi>
                        editorial on the same day, entitled “Thoughts on the Kowloon-Hong Kong
                        Fighting” and presumably commenting on this article, was completely deleted
                        by the censor—an occurrence unprecedented for this important and influential
                        paper.</p>
                    <p>This situation has become one of concern, not only to British officials in
                        China, but also to Chinese propaganda officials who see it as a hindrance to
                        the joint war effort of the United Nations. In a conversation on April 18,
                        Dr. Hollington Tong, Vice Minister of the Kuomintang’s Ministry of
                        Publicity, took the occasion to say to me that he was “much worried over the
                        alarming amount of anti-British feeling”—both in China and, judging from
                        reports he had received, in the United States. He felt that something should
                        be done to check it and to emphasize through propaganda that we are allies
                        fighting together and giving each other mutual assistance. The British
                        decision to decorate Chinese officers appears to have given the Ministry of
                        Publicity an opportunity for such propaganda. With the recent defeats of
                        British and Chinese forces in Burma, further efforts are being made to check
                        overt criticism of the British.</p>

                        increased during April. By April 25 there was no civil government operating

                        bombed by Japanese or threatened by attack. Collapse of civil government is
                        due to desertion and flight of native officials who cannot stand bombings or
                        threat of invasion. Many senior British officials are being sent to North

                    <p>There is attached for your consideration and approval the draft of a
                        memorandum to the Chinese Embassy<note n="73" xml:id="d43fn73">
                            <hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_39">p. 39</ref>.</note> in
                        reply to a request from the Chinese Government, through its Embassy here,
                        for an expression of this Government’s views concerning a statement in
                        regard to Thailand which it is proposed be issued at the “first opportune
                        moment” by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. The text of the Chinese
                        Government’s proposed statement is quoted in our proposed reply.</p>
                    <p>In speaking of the “Allied Nations”, it is believed that the Generalissimo is
                        merely giving his interpretation of the beliefs of the nations concerned and
                        is not intending to speak formally for them or in their behalf. As, however,
                        such use of the term might give rise to misunderstanding, we propose
                        informing the Chinese Government that this Government, were it to have need
                        of referring to the nations engaged in the common war effort, would use a
                        slightly altered phraseology.</p>
                    <p>The reference in the proposed statement to acts of Thailand as having been
                        committed under Japanese coercion appears to be somewhat at variance with
                        the facts and with the propaganda directive heretofore followed by this
                        Government and the British Government, namely, that, while expressing
                        sympathy for Thai people it would be undesirable to stress too strongly that
                        the Thai Government yielded to <hi rend="italic">force majeure</hi> in
                        signing a treaty of alliance with Japan. We propose calling this point to
                        the attention of the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>It is suggested that, if the Generalissimo should issue the statement in
                        question, you might care shortly thereafter to make a supporting statement
                        at your press conference along lines somewhat as follows: <quote

                    <p>509. The impressions I bring back from India and Burma are far from
                        encouraging. Burma is definitely lost and Assam would likely fall without
                        resistance. The Chinese left flank in Burma broke while the Chinese reserves
                        were engaged in the west endeavoring to extricate the British forces, and
                        the situation is now one of complete rout, the Japanese advancing rapidly in
                        all directions. Myitkyina was bombed ten minutes after my plane flew over it
                        en route to Kunming. Landing fields in northern Burma and Assam are now
                        within easy Japanese bombing range and it is going to be exceedingly
                        difficult if not impossible to maintain commercial air service between India
                        and China. In India during my very brief visit I found a situation which
                        promises no real or substantial resistance to Japanese invasion if
                        attempted. My military and naval attaches who saw General Wavell found him a
                        tired old man. The situation in the Calcutta area is particularly
                        distressing. The Bengalese are generally regarded as prepared to flee at the
                        first bombing, and in consequence 80% of India’s industrial war effort would
                        be demobilized. The few intelligent Indians, principally industrialists,
                        whom I met in Calcutta were much depressed, bitter against the Churchill
                        Government for having sabotaged the Cripps Mission,<note n="77"
                            xml:id="d44fn77">Sir Stafford Cripps, who was sent to India.</note> and
                        apparently opposed to any scorched earth policy in event of Japanese
                        attack.</p>
                    <p>I met no one of any nationality during my visit who was in any way
                        encouraging or optimistic. The Viceroy at New Delhi was noncommittal, but
                        obviously depressed.</p>

                        Government spokesman, said <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> that although
                        the situation in Burma is admittedly serious there is no alarm among the
                        Chinese people or among the rank and file of the Chinese Army. He further
                        states that the Chinese forces will not withdraw from Burma until the war is
                        won and that the Chinese will continue to reinforce the forces there
                        irrespective of whatever difficulties there may be. He said that a heavy
                        debt is owed the heroic and badly outnumbered forces of the Allied Army on
                        the Burma Front.</p>

                        Counselor of the Chinese Embassy left at the Department on April 18, 1942,
                        in regard to a proposed statement by General Chiang Kai-shek as follows:</p>
                    <p>[Here follows text printed on <ref target="#pg_32">page 32</ref>, beginning
                        with the word “First”.]</p>
                    <p>It is understood from the Chinese Embassy that the British Government is
                        agreeable to the issuance of the proposed statement.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States, for its part, concurs in the purpose
                        which the Chinese Government has in mind and, if General Chiang issues the
                        statement, will expect to take an informal occasion to make an appropriate
                        supporting statement.</p>
                    <p>In view of the possibility that the use of the term “Allied Nations”
                        contained in the text received from the Chinese Embassy might give rise in
                        some quarters to misunderstanding, this Government in its supporting
                        statement would, if there were need to refer to the nations engaged in the
                        common war effort, substitute for the term in question—at <pb n="40"
                            xml:id="pg_40" facs="0050"/>least in the initial reference—words such as
                        “the nations at war with Japan”.</p>
                    <p>This Government also offers for the consideration of the Chinese Government
                        the observation that it is doubtful whether it is desirable to stress too
                        strongly that the Thai Government yielded to <hi rend="italic">force
                            majeure</hi> in signing a treaty of alliance with Japan and in declaring
                        war on the United States and Great Britain, as set forth in the first
                        sentence of the first point of the proposed Chinese declaration. Question is
                        raised whether that sentence might not be omitted. Such omission would bring

                        gloomy picture regarding the military situation on the Burma-China-India

                        line with opinions already expressed in several well informed quarters. As
                        against that, however, there have been assurances from some of the best
                        informed quarters that the maintenance of that service is definitely
                        possible; also, there has been the assurance of the President that it will
                        be done.</p>
                    <p>The description of General Wavell as a “tired old man” confirms in exact
                        words estimates which have been reported by some other recent close-up
                        observers.</p>
                    <p>The statement that there is bitterness “against the Churchill Government for
                        having sabotaged the Cripps Mission” tends to confirm reports from other
                        sources that there was sabotaging.</p>
                    <p>In combination, these statements of fact and of opinion tend to confirm
                        gradually piling up indications that the saving of the situation in eastern
                        Asia and the Indian Ocean east of the Persian Gulf is going to depend upon

                    <p>In the view recorded on the first paragraph of page two that cessation of
                        Chinese resistance is “out of the question”, I do not entirely concur.
                        Notwithstanding Chiang Kai-shek’s will and intention to continue resistance,
                        the will and capacity of China as a whole to continue resistance is going to
                        depend in no small measure on the success or failure of the United States to
                        maintain communication with China and deliver munitions, et cetera, to the
                        Chinese Government; also, on the trend of events in the operations of war
                        between the United States and Japan.</p>
                    <p>But, in the view that “the Chinese might very well not fight their armies but
                        simply sit”, I concur—except that in my opinion Mrs. Luce fails to realize
                        that, as matters stand today, there may come a time when, if the United
                        States fails to deliver as above indicated, the Chinese armies will not have
                        the option of “sitting”: those armies may be compelled either to give up to
                        the Japanese or to retreat into China’s farthest west. The situation has
                        reached a point where Chiang Kai-shek—having observed British and American
                        inability to send adequate support to their <hi rend="italic">own</hi>
                        fighting forces in the Far East (conspicuously in the Philippines and in the

                            him</hi> materials promised—might decide to “sulk in his tent” and let
                        his armies “sit” until the United States and Great Britain give evidence of
                        a capacity and a definite intention to deliver to him at least a substantial
                        part of what has been promised him or an amount of materials in reasonable
                        proportion to the amounts that are being delivered by the United States to
                        the British and to the Russians, and by the British to the Russians.</p>

                    <p>526. According to a confidential report, the Generalissimo addressing his
                        military council on May 6 pointed out that the situation for China during
                        the next few months would be serious but expressed confidence in China’s
                        ability to meet it. He said that if Japan did not attack Russia it would
                        probably renew military operations in China—in Hunan and Chekiang, for
                        example. British failure to accord Chinese full cooperation was in a measure
                        responsible for defeat in Burma, he said. He expressed his belief that the
                        United States would give all possible aid to China, mentioning specifically
                        aviation. He made estimate that Japan had reached peak of military activity
                        which could not be maintained longer than 4 or 5 months.</p>

                        military situation have had their repercussions in China with a revival in
                        some quarters of defeatist attitudes, the assertion that China can continue
                        to resist only if the United Nations engage the Japanese in force elsewhere
                        and keep them off China, and rumors of renewed Japanese peace proposals to
                        China.</p>
                    <p>General Magruder, the Naval Attaché of the Embassy, and some others feel that
                        the Chinese are not fully aware of the gravity of the situation which finds
                        a Japanese column penetrating toward Kunming by way of the Burma Road
                        without opposition.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy does not find any serious alarm among the higher Chinese
                        officials over the immediate situation. There is disbelief that Japan will
                        attempt any major thrust into Yunnan by the Burma Road at this time although
                        it is admitted that they may penetrate some <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43"
                            facs="0053"/>distance along the road to destroy or seize accumulated
                        supplies and if possible reach and destroy the air base at Paoshan. There
                        are no reports of any Japanese movement toward Yunnan from Indochina. The
                        approaching rainy season is not a favorable time for a Japanese expedition
                        into Yunnan, and it would seem entirely possible for the Chinese with very
                        small forces to blast and block the Burma Road at a number of points to
                        impede the present Japanese advance and perhaps trap the column pushing
                        toward Paoshan. It is true that there are no reports that this is being
                        done, but I believe we should wait some days before concluding that the
                        Japanese push presents a grave situation that the Chinese cannot meet.</p>
                    <p>There is no confirmation of rumors of Japanese peace proposals to China. The
                        situation is believed to be, (1), that Chiang Kai-shek is determined to
                        continue resistance and, (2), that there is no group in the government with
                        sufficient influence to force Chiang’s retirement in order to come to terms
                        with the Japanese. It is true that Chiang has perhaps lost some prestige
                        over the result in Burma, to which area he sent troops in force contrary to
                        the advice of some of his military advisors, and he undoubtedly lost some
                        prestige through the momentary failure of his policy of reliance on the
                        assistance of America and other powers. But he remains the dominating figure
                        in the national government, and is believed to have the support of the

                    <p>529. Reference my 528, May 8, 4 p.m. In conversation with me yesterday
                        General Magruder envisaged the possibility if not probability of a necessary
                        withdrawal from Chungking and China and suggested preparations to that end.
                        I informed Magruder that while, of course, there is no objection to and it
                        is desirable that preliminary preparations by way of an inventory of
                        possible transport facilities, supplies, routes, personnel, et cetera, be
                        made in connection with any eventual necessary attempt at withdrawal from
                        Chungking, nothing should be done in any way to arouse the slightest
                        suspicion on the part of the Chinese of any lack of confidence in the
                        Chinese in American or other foreign circles; that my instructions are to
                        follow and remain <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0054"/>with the National
                        Government; that I propose to do this so long as that Government exists and
                        continues the policy of resistance to the Japanese; and that I would prefer
                        to take all risks of falling into Japanese hands rather than have the
                        Chinese believe we might be preparing to withdraw.</p>
                    <p>He is concerned as to possible attitude of Russians in event American
                        military personnel seeks to enter Soviet territory in a withdrawal from
                        China. That is a subject on which I cannot venture a prediction and I do not
                        feel that we should explore it at this time.</p>
                    <p>The Military Mission is now engaged in sending out to India the aviators who
                        arrived in China from the Tokyo flight and if air communication remains
                        possible, the Military Mission could if so ordered gradually reduce its
                        numbers by sending out others; this is a normal activity not likely to
                        excite comment; but I strongly deprecate any owner measures which might lead
                        to suspicion that a general withdrawal is contemplated.</p>

                        from Ambassador Gauss at Chungking a telegram<note n="85" xml:id="d52fn85"
                            >Telegram No. 529, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> of which I send
                        you here enclosed a careful paraphrase.</p>
                    <p>We concur fully in what evidently is Ambassador Gauss’ view that no move
                        should be made and no step be taken which might arouse or give ground for
                        the slightest suspicion on the part of the Chinese of any lack of confidence
                        in them, and we fully endorse the position taken by Mr. Gauss.</p>
                    <p>You will recall that as recently as April 28 the President said: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“… The Japanese may cut the Burma Road; but I want to say to the
                                gallant people of China that no matter what advances the Japanese
                                may make, ways will be found to deliver airplanes and munitions of
                                war to the armies of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
                            <p>“We remember that the Chinese people were the first to stand up and
                                fight against the aggressors in this war; and in the future an
                                unconquerable China will play its proper role in maintaining peace
                                and prosperity not only in Eastern Asia but in the whole

                        withdrawal of our Military Mission to China might, in our opinion, have an

                        and to the part which it has been and is hoped that China will play in the

                    <p>625. War Department Policy of giving maximum practicable aid to China remains
                        the same as heretofore. For Magruder. It is especially important in view of
                        recent reverses in Burma that all American Army Officers on duty in China
                        maintain an attitude of calm optimism with respect to Chinese future. Plans
                        and conversation must not imply any thought of hopelessness in situation or
                        any United States intention to abandon the country. The War Department does
                        not intend to place limits upon proper distribution of available American
                        Officers but it is important that movements of such personnel are so
                        regulated that they can not possibly be construed as an evacuation by
                        Americans. You are directed to convey to Mr. Gauss this expression of War
                        Department view and in absence of General Stilwell will acquaint other
                        American Officers therewith, who are to govern themselves accordingly.
                        Acknowledge.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Hornbeck</hi>: On 18th May Canberra
                        telegraphed to us the text of a telegram received from the Australian
                        Minister at Chungking. The date on which the telegram was despatched from
                        Chungking is not mentioned, but it is clearly a fairly recent telegram. As
                        the point of view expressed in the telegram is of importance, I thought you
                        might be interested to know its contents, if only to supplement the
                        information you have no doubt already received from United States
                        sources.</p>
                    <p>Sir Frederic Eggleston said in his telegram that he considered there was a
                        grave risk that Chinese resistance to the Japanese advance might be
                        exceedingly feeble, even if it did not collapse. So far as the position in
                        Yunnan is concerned, it appears that the Japanese risked a small column
                        along the road and were surprised at the ease with which they advanced.
                        Originally the party was small and returned to Lashio. The Japanese were now
                        advancing with three regiments and had reached the neighbourhood of Paoshan.
                        The Chinese had at least two divisions between Shiakuan and Lungling and
                        thus could hold the Japanese but they failed to resist and the absence of
                        demolitions was significant. The Japanese crossing of the Salween could have
                        been checked with a few machine guns.</p>
                    <p>The Australian Minister added that many people in Chungking believe that
                        Japan at the moment was deciding whether to make a major effort to liquidate
                        China or to take India. The principal factors were the feeble Chinese
                        resistance, as in Yunnan, and the anxiety to prevent further bombing of
                        Tokyo for which Chinese territory appeared essential. Some Chinese officials
                        were already expressing the view that they would soon be back in Nanking
                        leading a normal existence again. A member of the Chinese General Staff has
                        just told a Military Attaché of one of the Allied nations that the Chinese
                        were incensed with the British for failure to send reinforcements to Burma
                        which General Wavell had promised, and also at the fact that the British
                        Army in Burma was falling back on India instead of assisting in the defence
                        of China. The member of the Chinese General Staff went on to say that the
                        Chinese were not inclined to do anything more unless British help was
                        forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>Sir Frederic commented that he had little sympathy with the Chinese attitude,
                        but felt that their belief that others must assist was a fundamental issue
                        which must be recognized. He believed that some constructive effort was
                        necessary to strengthen Chinese resistance <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48"
                            facs="0058"/>and possibly to keep her in the war, while the time during
                        which such steps would be at all effective was possibly limited to a few
                        weeks. In his view such an effort should consist of (<hi rend="italic"

                    <p>578. The first official public expression of concern over present military
                        situation in China came yesterday when T. F. Tsiang, Government spokesman,
                        told the press that “the immediate future for China is very grave”, that
                        Japanese appear to be launching an all out effort to dispose of China now
                        and that “China needs all the help which our friends can send us and they
                        must send that help with utmost haste, otherwise United Nations may have to
                        pay double or triple the price for future recovery.” He underlined that in
                        the next 3 months China needs bombers and pursuits, first and last.</p>
                    <p>Situation admittedly holds serious possibilities. Japanese may have decided
                        to undertake major offensive in China. But Embassy so far perceives no
                        evidence of lack of Chinese determination to meet the threat nor have
                        potential defeatist elements increased in influence.</p>
                    <p>Military situation in Yunnan is far from clear. There are many factors
                        including weather, terrain, military logistics and what has appeared to be
                        broad Japanese military policy and objective which would seem to preclude
                        probability of major Japanese offensive in Yunnan. On the other hand,
                        Japanese have frequently undertaken the unexpected [and] that possibility
                        must not be dismissed. However, even should Japanese successfully invade
                        Yunnan and advance on other fronts, such as Chekiang-Hunan and toward
                        northwest, we do not believe that National Government will collapse or
                        disintegrate or that Japanese will be able to destroy it.</p>
                    <p>Embassy recommends that Chinese plea for increased American air support
                        should be met if at all practicable not only for its practical effect upon
                        course of military operations against Japanese but for psychological effect
                        on Government and people of such measure of American aid. Chinese should
                        have early proof that we consider China a vital theatre of the war.</p>

                    <p>The news of yesterday and today from China is bad, but worse than this news
                        is knowledge that we have had for sometime of the factual situation and
                        potentialities to which this news serves at the moment to call
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>Reports from our own sources in China, sent from or through Chungking, have
                        breathed a sense of frustration and defeatism. The feeling of our officials
                        and officers reflects in some measure the feeling of the Chinese circles in
                        which they move. The Chinese have seen the United States and Great Britain
                        sustaining military defeats. They have seen the Japanese gaining victories
                        elsewhere and closing in on China; they have seen the failure of the Cripps
                        mission in India and they have sensed the ineptitude of British military and
                        political operations in the Far Eastern theater and the Indian Ocean area;
                        they have heard and have rejoiced in American promises that we would get
                        goods into China and they have seen that the goods do not arrive; they are
                        now hearing that the goods do not arrive because we cannot send them and
                        that we cannot send them because (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) high mountains
                        are an obstacle and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) we and the British need for
                        other fronts (British and Russian) all planes available and therefore cannot
                        spare more than a <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0060"/>couple dozen (three
                        dozen at the outside) transport planes for traffic into and out of
                        Chungking.</p>
                    <p>As I understand it, the President has been liberal and positive in promising
                        to the Chinese a substantial number of adequate planes; but somewhere,
                        somehow, orders become modified, allocations are pared down, diversions are
                        made, planes en route are held at intermediate points, and the net is that
                        the transport service upon which the Chinese have relied as a sort of last
                        hope does not materialize.</p>
                    <p>On May 8 we had from Gauss at Chungking a confidential report<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d60fn7">Telegram No. 526, May 8, 9 a.m., <ref target="#pg_42">p.
                                42</ref>.</note> of information given him in confidence that General
                        Chiang in an address on May 6 to his military council had pointed out that
                        during the next few months the situation for China would be very serious;
                        that Chiang said that if the Japanese did not attack the Soviet Union they
                        probably would resume military operations in and against China; but that he
                        believed that America would give China all possible assistance and he
                        emphasized assistance in the field of aviation.</p>
                    <p>Although Japan may yet attack the Soviet Union, best military estimates at
                        present are that that operation is not at the top of the list among Japan’s
                        present intentions. The logic of movements during recent weeks has pointed
                        toward probable intensification of Japanese operations in and against
                        Chungking. And now the spot news points to Chinese expectation that such
                        operations are Japan’s present preoccupation.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese are ill prepared militarily and psychologically to prevent the
                        Japanese from making great gains and the Japanese are well prepared to make
                        great gains in operations which the Japanese might now undertake. China has
                        no air force, is woefully lacking in artillery and anti-aircraft, is short
                        on machine guns and has no large reserves of small arms and ammunition.
                        Chinese morale has been preserved for many months past by expectation of aid
                        from the United States and Great Britain and assurances that she shall have
                        aid by the United States. So long as the Chinese remain confident that such
                        aid is going to reach them, there is fair chance of their morale holding up
                        and their resistance continuing. But let once the point be reached, at which
                        they reach a conclusion that aid cannot or will not reach them, that their
                        hope and confidence evaporate—at and from that point there will be no reason
                        for them not to say to themselves that the chance of the United Nations
                        defeating Hitler and Japan is certainly not better than fifty-fifty and the
                        sensible course for them to follow is to make with Japan the best compromise
                        possible. The sequel would be: China no longer in the war, China’s soil no
                        longer available to the United Nations for operations against Japan; China’s
                        natural resources and man power available to Japan for operations <pb n="51"
                            xml:id="pg_51" facs="0061"/>against Japan’s remaining enemies (Great
                        Britain and the United States).</p>
                    <p>From now on there is only one way by which we can make sure of maintaining
                        China’s confidence: we must deliver goods. Deliveries can be made and an
                        artery of communication between China and us can be maintained if we will
                        but put into the job of creating and maintaining an air transport service
                        such courage, such ingenuity and such effort as we have been and are putting
                        into a variety of operations in other places and other contexts. The best
                        informed among my contacts are confident that this thing can be done and
                        that it need not be very expensive.</p>
                    <p>If we fail to do this, whether because of high mountains or because of a view
                        that planes devoted to this task and thus subtracted from the numbers
                        devoted to tasks on the British and Russian fronts are planes better
                        invested, we stand a good chance of losing the best strategic bet that is
                        offered us in eastern Asia. China can be kept in the ranks of the United
                        Nations. There is no guarantee that Russia can be kept in those ranks. There
                        is even a chance that Australia might be taken out of those ranks. But it is
                        a good bet that the Chinese will “stick” as long as they have reason to
                        believe that we can and we will keep contact with them and give them some
                        aid.</p>
                    <p>The number of planes needed for doing this job is ridiculously small in
                        comparison with the relatively huge numbers that we are sending to other
                        fronts. Is there not something wrong about a strategy—I am not saying that
                        such a strategy definitely has been adopted—which in theory or in practice
                        would call for investing everything in several scattered theaters and
                        investing absolutely nothing in a theater which, if occupied by the enemy,
                        would mean the loss of a useful ally and the acquisition by the enemy of
                        that prize which has been the major objective of political and military
                        operations on his part for a period of nearly fifty years.</p>
                    <p>What we most need to do at this moment is to get an air transport service
                        into operation on a fair scale—and to do it now.</p>

                    <p>We are, as I am sure you are, greatly concerned with regard to the Chinese
                        situation.</p>
                    <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0062"/>
                    <p>With the cutting of the Burma Road by Japan and with Japanese advances into
                        Yunnan Province, the Chinese Government is undoubtedly facing one of its
                        most difficult periods.</p>
                    <p>If the Japanese get the idea that a military campaign against Kunming and
                        Chungking would not encounter effective resistance there is every
                        probability that Japan would launch such an attack. The best way to ensure
                        against Japan’s making such an attack or, if made, of causing it to fail, is
                        to help the Chinese militarily so that their resistance can be
                        effective.</p>
                    <p>If the Chinese Government should be forced to withdraw from Chungking, the
                        effects on Chinese morale might well be disastrous and the whole military,
                        economic and psychological situation of the United Nations would be greatly
                        impaired.</p>
                    <p>You will recall that in your address to the nation of April 28 in referring
                        to China you stated: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p rend="flushleft">“The Japanese may cut the Burma Road; but I want to
                                say to the gallant people of China that no matter what advances the
                                Japanese may make, ways will be found to deliver airplanes and
                                munitions of war to the armies of Generalissimo Chiang
                                Kai-shek.”</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>I venture to suggest that two steps seem to be essential: (1) the putting
                        into operation without delay of the projected air freight service to enable
                        China to maintain contact with her allies and also to obtain vitally needed
                        materials and (2) the making available to General Stilwell of aerial combat
                        units at least sufficient to deny the Japanese command of the air.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the air freight service from India into China, I am told that
                        the War Department is giving this matter active attention and that from
                        thirty-seven to fifty planes are already in India or are due there shortly.
                        It is believed that these planes should be put into operation at the
                        earliest feasible moment and that the number should be increased as soon as
                        possible. It is understood that last February you directed that twenty-five
                        transport planes proceed to India in March for the India–China freight
                        service, but that as yet virtually no freight has been moved.</p>
                    <p>With regard to making available to China additional aerial combat units, I
                        realize the great need for such units elsewhere, especially in the Russian,
                        Near Eastern and European theaters. However, the number of planes which
                        would meet China’s needs in this respect would constitute only a small
                        percentage of the planes which are being made available to our other
                        allies.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that the taking of comparatively minor preventive steps now
                        may obviate the need of much greater and more difficult steps later on.</p>
                    <p>I offer the foregoing comment simply by way of suggestion in the light of my
                        deep feeling that we must do everything possible to keep <pb n="53"
                            xml:id="pg_53" facs="0063"/>China fighting as an ally whose importance
                        to our cause cannot, in my opinion, be too much stressed.</p>

                    <p>The Japanese thrust into Yunnan from Burma, following the virtual capture of
                        Burma and isolation of free China from the outside world, has created a
                        situation in which the Chinese Government appears to be facing the gravest
                        crisis in its resistance against Japan.</p>
                    <p>It is, of course, not known whether the Japanese actually plan to drive on to
                        Kunming with a view to driving the Chinese Government from Chungking by
                        concentrated air attack or by other means, but such possibility would seem
                        definitely to exist. Furthermore, in the light of the Chinese lack of
                        equipment and air support, there also exists the possibility that the
                        Japanese might succeed in capturing Kunming.</p>
                    <p>If the Chinese Government should be forced out of Chungking there would arise
                        a serious danger that the effect on Chinese morale would be disastrous. It
                        would not only constitute the third flight of the Chinese Government from
                        its capitals, but would be an especially heavy blow as a sequel to another
                        disaster—gaining of access by the Japanese to the Burma Road—and the tragic
                        letdown from the high hopes held by the Chinese when Japan brought the
                        United States and Great Britain into the war.</p>
                    <p>It is accordingly believed that it is vitally necessary that communications
                        between China and the outside world be maintained—especially air transport
                        between India and China—and that critical military supplies continue to be
                        furnished in the greatest amount possible irrespective of the cost of money,
                        effort or matériel.</p>

                    <p>Adverse effects of recent events on Chinese morale are being manifested in
                        various degrees and kinds of expression of disappointment in and greatly
                        diminished confidence in the attitude and capacity of Great Britain and the
                        United States. It is believed that the implications of these manifestations
                        are serious and should be counteracted. This Chinese change of attitude
                        which various observers predict may <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0064"
                        />develop into serious anti-foreignism arises in part from the heavy defeats
                        which have been sustained by British and American arms. It cannot but seem
                        to the Chinese the height of irony that the entry of Great Britain and the
                        United States into war against Japan—a development for which the Chinese
                        have been hoping for several years—has not only not resulted in relieving
                        their precarious situation, but, by misadventure, has actually been followed
                        by appearance of Japanese armed forces at China’s back door and has led to
                        the closing of China’s main channel of trade and communications with the
                        outside world. In part, this changing Chinese attitude arises from
                        disappointment at the meagerness of military assistance furnished the
                        Chinese, from a feeling of being neglected as regards expedition of military
                        supplies, particularly airplanes, in favor of Allied forces elsewhere, and
                        from resentment at the emphasis which is being placed by the United States
                        and Great Britain on the European front at the expense of current military
                        efforts against Japan. The Chinese see clearly the dangerous aspects of any
                        assumption that we can let things slide in the Far East while defeating
                        Hitler and that the crushing of the Nazi military machine in Europe will
                        clear the way for an easy retrieving <hi rend="italic">thereafter</hi> of

                        China an equal ally and full partner in the common cause, bring China into
                        our councils wherever and whenever appropriate and practicable, and give
                        every consideration through our officials at home and our diplomatic and
                        military officers in China to Chinese sensibilities in regard to the status
                        of China’s partnership with us and the status of China as a potential leader
                        among the nations of East Asia.</p>

                            [Footnote in the original.]</note> of May 3, 1942, entitled “An Urgent
                            Suggestion”,<note n="11" xml:id="d64fn2">Not printed.</note> which in
                        its discussion of the war effort of the United Nations offers comment
                        thereon which is indicative of the tone of the Chinese press since the
                        reverses in upper Burma.</p>
                    <p>The editorial points out the failure of the United Nations to estimate
                        correctly the real strength of Japan prior to the outbreak of hostilities in
                        the Pacific area, their failure yet to appreciate the life and death aspects
                        of the struggle, their failure to rid themselves of a defensive psychosis
                        toward the war and their failure to announce for the Pacific area a charter
                        similar to the Atlantic Charter. The editorial describes the needs of the
                        United Nations as (1) effective cooperation and coordination, (2) offensive
                        action against the Japanese, (3) defense of Northern Burma as the last link
                        between China and India and (4) solution of the Indian problem so that unity
                        may be achieved between the United Nations.</p>

                    <p>In the course of their conversation today in Mr. Murray’s office, both
                        Colonel Johnson and Colonel Herrington stated that Burma is completely gone
                        and that with the loss of Burma, particularly of Lashio, all possible routes
                        to China are closed. Those roads which are alleged to be under construction
                        would take at least two years to complete. Even the air freight route is no
                        longer feasible as the planes must now fly in bad weather at 23,000 feet
                        which those available are unable to do, and even in good weather must fly so
                        high as to render attempts at ferrying freight into China almost useless.
                        Personnel can still be flown in and out of China, but at great hazard. The
                        effect on China has been catastrophic and it is the opinion of the speakers
                        that the <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0067"/>Chinese no longer intend to
                        fight. Discouragement on the part of the Chinese has been intensified by the
                        behavior of the British as indicated below.</p>
                    <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>Colonel Johnson and Colonel Herrington were both of the opinion that the
                        British had determined long before the Japanese attack on Burma started to
                        lose Burma to the Japanese rather than to make concessions to the Burmese or
                        to be indebted to the Chinese for retaining it. Thus the Chinese were
                        allowed to send in troops only when their offer of assistance could no
                        longer be refused, and once the Chinese arrived no effort to support them
                        was forthcoming. According to Colonel Johnson and Colonel Herrington the
                        British preferred to lose Burma because of their belief that it would be
                        either recaptured for them by the Americans or returned to them at the peace
                        conference once the war was won, and they would then be committed to neither
                        the Burmese nor the Chinese with regard to its future form of government.
                        Colonel Johnson and Colonel Herrington felt that the policy involved
                        emanated from Wavell, who in turn was supporting a policy determined in
                        London. They said that the loss of Burma would, however, probably be laid by
                        the British to Stilwell who had actually made a very good showing under the
                        circumstances.</p>

                    <p>The loss of the Burma Road, followed by heavy Japanese attacks now developing
                        on the vital sectors of our defenses in southern, central and northwestern
                        China, has created a very dangerous situation. In addition, the people are
                        greatly depressed by the continuous United Nations reverses in the Pacific
                        and on the Asiatic mainland, and the apparent lack of determination to
                        counter-attack. Our war of resistance has now arrived at the most crucial
                        stage such as I never experienced before.</p>
                    <p>I am most anxious to discuss the situation with you in person, but at present
                        it is impossible for me to leave China. I strongly request you to send Mr.
                        Harry Hopkins immediately to China so that I could acquaint him with the
                        situation, and consult you intimately through him. I await most anxiously
                        your favorable reply.</p>

                        held on May 26, 1942 between Colonel Louis Johnson, Colonel Herrington, and
                        officers of the Department, in regard to various aspects of the Burma
                        campaign, and especially the statements of Colonel Johnson and Colonel
                        Herrington that, with the loss of Burma, “all possible routes to China are
                        closed”, that “even the air freight route is no longer feasible”, and that
                        “the effect on China has been catastrophic and it is the opinion of the
                        speakers that the Chinese no longer intend to fight”.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the question of air supply routes to China, it should be
                        mentioned that Mr. W. R. Bond of the China National Aviation Corporation,
                        who established and maintained an efficient airplane service between Hong
                        Kong and Chungking over Japanese held territory, is firmly of the belief
                        that an air supply route can be successfully operated between India and
                        China over Japanese held territory in Burma, provided that the necessary
                        airplanes and equipment can be obtained.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the opinion expressed by Colonel Johnson and Colonel
                        Herrington that the “Chinese no longer intend to fight”, it may be recalled
                        that in his telegram no. 578 of May 20, Ambassador Gauss at Chungking stated
                        that, while the situation in China admittedly had serious possibilities, the
                        Embassy had so far perceived no evidence of lack of determination on the
                        part of the Chinese to meet the threat, nor had the influence of potential
                        defeatist elements increased. The Ambassador expressed the belief that, even
                        if the Japanese should successfully invade Yunnan and advance on other
                        fronts, such as in Hunan–Chekiang and in the northwest, the National
                        Government would not collapse or disintegrate nor would the Japanese be able
                        to destroy it. The Ambassador recommended that, if at all practicable, the
                        Chinese request for increased American air support should be met, not only
                        because of its practical effect on the course of military operations against
                        the enemy, but also because of the psychological effect on the Chinese
                        Government and people of such American assistance.</p>

                    <p>622. I report the following as indicative, if not representative, of a trend
                        of thought in certain intelligent nonpolitical Chinese circles: In
                        connection with the present press and official campaign for military aid to
                        China, a Chinese landlord businessman commented to Vincent<note n="22"
                            xml:id="d70fn22">John Carter Vincent, Counselor of Embassy in
                            China.</note> that Russia must be considered a much more vital theater
                        of the war than China, that only such material aid as was not needed in
                        Russia should be diverted to China, that if Russian resistance collapses a
                        successful termination of the war could be well nigh impossible whereas if
                        Chinese resistance collapsed it would still be possible to achieve victory,
                        and that he therefore hoped, together with many other thinking Chinese, that
                        we would not be diverted by the Chinese clamor for assistance from giving
                        all possible aid to Russia. He said that the economic situation, rather than
                        the military, was the Chinese Government’s most urgent problem.</p>

                    <p>I endorse and support the opinions expressed and the points made by Mr.
                        Hamilton in his memorandum of May 28.</p>
                    <p>In addition, I would refer to several memoranda which have been presented
                        during recent weeks pointing out that, as regards Chinese intentions, on the
                        one hand, armies which do not have weapons are quite likely not to intend to
                        fight and, on the other hand, that Chinese armies actually are fighting
                        every day as has been shown by recent reports of the operations along the
                        southern end of the Burma Road, in Chekiang province, et cetera.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the opinion that the air freight route between Calcutta and
                        Chungking “is no longer feasible”, I would point out that the weather
                        conditions which at this moment may be an obstacle will prevail for only a
                        period of from three to five months and do not prevail from September until

                        trial, trial for the making of which he has volunteered his own services and

                    <p>The Chinese Foreign Minister, Dr. Soong, called this morning at his
                        request.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong handed me a telegram he had just received from his Government
                        stating that the Japanese had used poison gas in recent attacks which the
                        Japanese Army had made in eastern Chekiang. The Chinese Government requested
                        the United States Government to threaten retaliation against the Japanese if
                        the Japanese Army continued to use poison gas. The text of the message is as
                        follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The enemy employed gas shells in the recent attacks on Chienteh and
                                Kinhwa in eastern Chekiang. At Chienteh the enemy also dropped gas
                                bombs from airplanes. Our army has suffered serious losses from such
                                poison gas.</p>
                            <p>“In October 1941, the enemy used mustard gas at Ichang. Authentic
                                cases have been reported and certified by Chinese and foreign
                                doctors who examined soldiers thus afflicted. Now that the enemy has
                                again resorted to gas in eastern Chekiang, it is to be feared that
                                further large-scale use of gas may be resorted to by the enemy,
                                unless international denunciation of such use and support of our
                                protests should be forthcoming immediately.</p>
                            <p>“Please approach the United States Government with a view to their
                                taking measures to support our protests, and to denouncing the <pb
                                    n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0071"/>enemy along the lines of the
                                statement made by the British Prime Minister recently, where he
                                threatened retaliation should Germany start gas warfare on the
                                Russian front. We hope that a statement couched in sternest tones
                                will be made.”</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>I told the Minister that I would be glad immediately to submit this request
                        from the Chinese Government to the President in as much as only the
                        President, as Commander-in-Chief, could make a decision with regard to a
                        matter of this fundamental character.</p>

                    <p>“Please transmit the following message to the President:</p>
                    <p>“During this time when the Chinese theatre is in such urgent need of combat
                        and transport planes, I am deeply grateful to you for the <pb n="62"
                            xml:id="pg_62" facs="0072"/>despatch to us of the Tenth Air Group,
                        originally stationed in India, and also of other planes formerly stationed
                        in Australia, to assist in war operations. This timely addition of new
                        fighting power will not only strengthen the morale of the army and improve
                        the war situation, but will encourage the Chinese army to redouble its
                        efforts.</p>
                    <p>“Air transportation is now a matter of great urgency. Based on the experience
                        of the last few months, two-motor transportation planes, with their limited
                        carrying capacity and performance, have been found entirely inadequate for
                        the India–China route. I understand that, commencing June of this year, the
                        United States will be in a position to produce fifteen DC–4 four-motor
                        transport planes. Will you be so good as to allocate these planes and other
                        planes of this type for use along the India–China air route? Because the war
                        situation is presently more acute in our theatre of war than elsewhere, I am
                        hopeful that you will give favorable consideration to my request.</p>

                        be widely heralded as an indication of some important impending action by
                        America and would, in a way, serve “to encourage the garrison until supplies
                        arrived”, that is, until we can get the air freight service organized and
                        build up our air strength in China. It would, of course, strengthen Chiang’s
                        position. In addition, it would afford an opportunity to: <list>

                        things done. If, however, the trip is deemed to be too long and too
                        hazardous, I should like, most diffidently, to remind you of my own

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose as of possible
                        interest to the Department copy of a memorandum of my conversation on May
                        25, with the British Ambassador<note n="28" xml:id="d78fn28">Sir Horace
                            James Seymour.</note> and the Australian Minister, who called on me by
                        appointment, to discuss the crisis in the China situation with a view to
                        determining whether there is anything that our Governments might do to “keep
                        China in the war on our side”.</p>
                    <p>Both the British Ambassador and the Australian Minister are new to China and
                        their rather gloomy views may be ascribed in part to their lack of China
                        background and resulting difficulty in evaluating the situation; also, in
                        part at least, to the “defeatist” attitude of certain elements of the
                        community, including some American and British <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64"
                            facs="0074"/>military officers, who should be more objective in their
                        viewpoint and more discreet in their expressions of opinion.<note n="29"
                            xml:id="d78fn29">In a tag memorandum dated June 30 to the Secretary of
                            State, the Adviser on Political Relations (Hornbeck) commented that
                            Ambassador Gauss gave “an estimate of the military-political situation
                            which I consider much more measured and sane than what the military and
                            naval attachés appear (we are not given much of their reports) to have
                            been reporting.” Mr. Hornbeck added: “Incidentally, the kind of thing
                            that Gauss does as reported in this despatch is a good exhibit in
                            support of the favorable opinion which the FE officers of the Department
                            hold regarding Gauss’s fundamental capacity and reliable
                            performance.”</note>

                        <p>The British Ambassador and Australian Minister called on me by
                            appointment at my residence yesterday afternoon. The British Ambassador
                            asked the Australian Minister to explain the object of their visit, and
                            the latter stated that it was felt that the China situation had reached
                            a crisis where we should all consider whether there is anything that our
                            Governments might do to “keep China in the war on our side”. He
                            considered the situation in Chekiang and Yunnan to be grave and
                            indicated that he feared that China might stop fighting and collapse.
                            The British Ambassador added nothing to the foregoing.</p>
                        <p>I asked my Australian colleague what he had to suggest that we might
                            recommend to our Governments in the situation as he sees it. Sir
                            Frederick said that he had no specific proposals to make. He referred to
                            the recent plea of the Chinese Government spokesman for more air support
                            to China, suggested that the possibility of continuing supplies to China
                            by new routes should be considered, and remarked that perhaps there
                            might be something that the United Nations might say to China—something
                            more than appears in the Atlantic Charter or the Declaration of the
                            United Nations—something that will encourage China to go on fighting,
                            that will assure China that the United Nations will continue to fight on
                            until China’s aspirations as well as our own are achieved. He wondered
                            whether there is any other aid or assistance that can be given to China
                            and commented that while he understood the terms of the United States
                            loan to China had been <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0075"/>settled,
                            he understood that there were unsettled points in the terms of the
                            British loan; he said that perhaps these might be settled and give
                            encouragement to China. The British Ambassador had nothing to add to the
                            foregoing; nor did he comment on the unsettled points, whatever they may
                            be, in the terms of the British loan to China.</p>
                        <p>I commented as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Air Support. I had of course noted the statement of the Government
                            spokesman and had brought the plea to the attention of Washington,
                            recommending that, so far as practicable, further air support should be
                            given to China. But I pointed out that this matter of air support is not
                            a simple problem. So far as concerns planes from the United States, we
                            have been pressed for planes for Britain, Russia, India, Australia,
                            China and for other United Nations; in addition, we are endeavoring to
                            build up our own air force to offensive fighting strength. Whether more
                            planes can be spared for China is not a matter we can determine here; it
                            must be determined in the councils at Washington, so far as concerns
                            American planes.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that planes alone are not sufficient; there must be
                            personnel to fly them, fight them and service them; there must be
                            airfields in China capable of taking them; there must be supplies of
                            aviation gas, and bombs, and spare parts; there must be ground crews. I
                            also pointed out that fighter planes cannot be flown from America to
                            China; there is the question of shipping space. China has only limited
                            personnel to fight and fly planes and service them. All these, I said,
                            are problems which require consideration; and while I had recommended
                            that so far as practicable, additional air support be given to China, I
                            could not say what could be done in that direction; but I pointed to the
                            AVG and what it had accomplished, and added that while I was en route to
                            India I had met AVG and United States Army pilots who had been flying in
                            fighter planes to China that had reached India from the United States,
                            and I had every confidence that my Government would do all in its power
                            to give air support to China.</p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador commented that he had recommended to London that
                            China have more air support.</p>
                        <p>2. Routes of Supply for China. I commented that according to my
                            information, all possible routes of supply are being investigated; that
                            to the northwest to Soviet Russia seems particularly important, both the
                            land route and the air route, but whether the routes can be opened seems
                            to depend on the attitude of Soviet Russia. I said that I believed that
                            our governments are well aware of this situation and no doubt they are
                            giving Chinese proposals all possible support. The British Ambassador
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>I continued that I was aware that United States Army transport planes are
                            continuing to bring in essential supplies from India and Assam—American
                            lend-lease materials—notwithstanding dangerous conditions and
                            unfavorable weather.</p>
                        <p>I suggested that if anyone had anything to offer to assist in the
                            situation I, for one, should be glad to learn of it.</p>
                        <p>3. On any “assurances” to China which might help the situation, it has
                            seemed to me that the Atlantic Charter and the Declaration of the United
                            Nations had been clear indications of our determination <pb n="66"
                                xml:id="pg_66" facs="0076"/>to fight for China as well as ourselves.
                            I had nothing to recommend to my Government in the present situation,
                            but if anyone could make a suggestion I should be glad to discuss it. I
                            commented that I knew nothing of the matter of the British loan to
                            China. I added that as they perhaps knew, we had sent substantial
                            amounts of supplies to Burma for China; in fact more than China had been
                            able to move into China from Burma; no doubt considerable amounts of
                            these supplies had been lost in Burma and inside China along the Burma
                            Road, but I had no official information on the extent of such
                            losses.</p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador commented that he and the British Counselor of
                            Embassy had turned up their file showing the texts of the Atlantic
                            Charter and the Declaration of the United Nations at Washington and had
                            nothing to suggest further at this time.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the military situation (I knew that the Australian Minister
                            has long been of the opinion that Japan would stop to liquidate the
                            China situation before venturing toward India or Australia) I commented
                            that I did not yet see indications that Japan intends to undertake a
                            major offensive against China; that there are as yet no reports of
                            substantial Japanese reinforcements for the China theater; that it is
                            true that for some days the Japanese thrust up the Burma Road appeared
                            ominous, but after the AVG had intervened and given the Chinese time to
                            move troops into position that situation seemed improved and I doubted
                            whether the Japanese, at the present time, intended to do more than (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) block all access from India and Assam into
                            China and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) reach, and seize or destroy all
                            possible American and other supplies for China stored along the lower
                            reaches of the Burma Road. Japan may later determine on an offensive
                            into Yunnan along the Burma Road, and perhaps from Indochina and
                            Thailand, but such an offensive would require extensive preparation, and
                            the present is not the ideal season for such a movement.</p>
                        <p>As to the Chekiang front, I conceded that the situation there is
                            discouraging; Japan undoubtedly intends to seize the Chinese airfields
                            in Chekiang and Kiangsi, and to shut off all Chinese access to the coast
                            (where smuggling routes have long functioned); but the move in Chekiang
                            seems to have been undertaken by local forces from the surrounding
                            areas—there has been nothing as yet to indicate substantial Japanese
                            reinforcements from outside China.</p>
                        <p>I commented further that in my contact with the higher Chinese officials
                            I had observed no suggestion that China’s will to resist is weakening,
                            nor had I observed that those elements which perhaps would be disposed
                            to look to a possible compromise with Japan had gained any strength.</p>
                        <p>Both the British Ambassador and the Australian Minister being new to
                            China, but the British Counselor of Embassy, Sir Eric Teichman, <pb
                                n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0077"/>being an “old China hand”, I
                            looked to him for helpful comment; but in response to the request for
                            his views on the subject he would not comment further than to say that
                            he considers that China “is in an exceedingly difficult position”.</p>
                        <p>Summing up, the Australian Minister said that he proposed to report to
                            Canberra, as the result of our conversation, that the matter of
                            additional air support for China has been brought to the attention of
                            both London and Washington, that the question of new supply routes to
                            China has not been overlooked and is being explored along with the
                            Chinese, and that there is no suggestion as to any recommendation which
                            we might make to our Governments for further “assurances” to China at
                            this time.</p>
                        <p>Sir Eric Teichman in summing up my comments on the military situation
                            said that he understood that I did not consider the situation hopeless,
                            that I did not anticipate that the Japanese would undertake a major
                            offensive in China at the present moment—though they might prepare to do
                            so later—but were concentrating on shutting off the Burma Road and
                            seizing and destroying all military supplies they could reach in that
                            area, while in Chekiang they were moving to take over the Chinese
                            airfields which might be used as bases against Japan. That I did not
                            find China less determined to continue to resist.</p>
                        <p>(Note: Except that the British Ambassador and the Australian Minister are
                            both new to China and are apparently helpless in evaluating the China
                            situation, I would have considered their visit in which they offered so
                            little and demanded so much by way of information and opinion, a
                            peculiar move. I felt however that there has been so much of a defeatist
                            attitude taken in some foreign (including military) quarters at
                            Chungking that it was desirable to be frank and outspoken in the
                            expression of my views which they had sought).</p>

                    <p>Yesterday afternoon I talked with Dr. Tsiang Ting-fu, Chief of the Political
                        Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan and former Chinese Ambassador to
                        Russia, at some length. In reply to my inquiry concerning American technical
                        experts for China, he said that the Executive Yuan was proceeding on a basis
                        of requesting only men who could fill an immediate and urgent need in China
                        and that a list of some ten or eleven experts would be submitted soon.<note
                            n="31" xml:id="d80fn31">See <ref target="#pg_697">pp. 697</ref>
                            ff.</note> I inquired concerning negotiations with the Russians for
                        exchange of materials over the northwest motor truck route. He confirmed the
                        report that agreement had been reached in principle for transportation each
                        way of about 3,000 tons monthly made up of strategic materials for Russia
                        and lend-lease supplies and gasoline for China.<note n="32" xml:id="d80fn32"
                            >See <ref target="#pg_632">pp. 632</ref> ff.</note> Thereafter the
                        discussion became general.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Tsiang does not view the present Japanese campaigns in Chekiang, Yunnan,
                        Kiangsi and the north as a concerted offensive to overthrow the Chungking
                        Government and end Chinese resistance. He added that they would fail if that
                        were their objective. He said however that the campaigns, particularly those
                        in Chekiang and Kiangsi, must be viewed as a serious threat to China and the
                        effectiveness of Chinese resistance. Loss of the Chekiang airfields, of
                        access to the eastern seaboard and to the southeastern area generally would
                        obviously have adverse effects upon the military situation in China but of
                        course would not affect the policy of resistance. He did not subscribe to
                        the thesis of George Fielding Eliot<note n="33" xml:id="d80fn33">American
                            writer and radio commentator.</note> that the Japanese were attempting
                        to clear the way for an overland rail route from Manchuria through China to
                        Indochina as an alternative or a supplement to the shipping route along the
                        China coast. He said that such a rail route (single track) could not
                        transport very much and would be readily vulnerable to interruption by
                        guerilla attack. He agreed that, when sea transport between Japan and
                        Indochina was menaced to the point that resort to rail transport through
                        China was necessary, the “beginning of the end” would be clearly in sight
                        and rail transport would do little to retard developments.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Tsiang referred to conversations with the Russian Ambassador<note n="34"
                            xml:id="d80fn34">Alexander Semenovich Panyushkin.</note> in regard to
                        material aid to China (he did not indicate whether <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69"
                            facs="0079"/>he himself had participated in the conversations but it was
                        clear that he was quite familiar with them). The Russian Ambassador
                        apparently raised some question as to the relative needs of Russia and China
                        for aid and had implied that Dr. Tsiang’s plea some weeks ago at a press
                        conference for increased aid to China had been calculated to divert
                        essential aid from Russia. (I am inclined to believe that the discussions
                        were primarily concerned with the question of transit of lend-lease supplies
                        through Russian Turkestan and over the northwest route to China and that the
                        observations mentioned by Dr. Tsiang were incidental to those
                            discussions.<note n="35" xml:id="d80fn35">See <ref target="#pg_591">pp.
                                591</ref> ff.</note>) Dr. Tsiang said that it was pointed out to the
                        Russians that, when war in Siberia between Russia and Japan commenced, it
                        would be very much to Russia’s interest to have a strong Chinese army
                        capable of lending assistance to the Russians by attacks upon the Japanese
                        in north and northeast China; that there would then be one fight and one
                        land front in east Asia; and that the Chinese flank of that front could only
                        operate effectively if supplied with war materials. Dr. Tsiang said that the
                        Russian Ambassador admitted the correctness of this argument. (I know that
                        the Russians are very critical of China for its alleged failure to use war
                        materials sent from Russia during past years, most of those materials having
                        been given to General Hu Tsung-man’s troops whose primary task has been the
                        quarantining of the Chinese communist armies in northern Shensi, and doubt
                        that the Ambassador was impressed by the argument, although agreement to
                        cooperate in the transportation of materials over the northwest route would
                        seem to indicate concurrence.)</p>
                    <p>I asked Dr. Tsiang whether any question with regard to supplies for the
                        Chinese communist troops had come up during the discussions of exchange of
                        materials through Sinkiang and whether the communist troops would be used in
                        the event of Russo-Japanese hostilities. In answer to the first question, he
                        said he did not think so, and he did not know the answer to the second
                        question. Dr. Tsiang inferred that it was sometimes difficult to arrange for
                        cooperation with the Russians and mentioned a Chinese proposal to establish
                        a Chinese radio broadcast station in Blagoveshchensk to spread propaganda
                        among the Chinese in Manchuria which had been turned down by the
                        Russians.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Tsiang said that it began to look like Siberia would be the next field
                        for major Japanese operations with concurrent operations in China closely
                        related thereto. He felt that there was greater likelihood that the Japanese
                        would attack in Siberia in the event of German reverses in Russia than in
                        the event of Russian reverses. He thought that the Japanese were conscious
                        of the futility of their fight in the <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0080"
                        />east if Russia defeated Germany. I said I thought the Japanese would
                        attack in either event and that preparations were now being made, in China
                        and elsewhere, against the arrival of an opportune time for such an
                        attack.</p>
                    <p>In reply to my query regarding developments with respect to Korea,<note
                            n="37" xml:id="d80fn37">See bracketed note, <ref target="#pg_762">p.
                                762</ref>.</note> Dr. Tsiang expressed fear that Korea was destined
                        again to become a pawn in international power politics. He did not pursue
                        the subject but I inferred that he had in mind Russian ambitions in that
                        area. He went on to say that China would emerge from the war the strongest
                        Far Eastern power; that there would be a strong urge for the Chinesse
                        Government to play power politics in this area; but that it would be a
                        mistake to succumb to that temptation because it would divert strength and
                        attention from China’s real problem which was internal reform and
                        reconstruction. He said that the strengthening of the internal structure of
                        the country should be the Chinese Government’s principal post war occupation
                        for many years to come. He said that post war relations with the United
                        States presented no real problem; that there was a sound basis for exchange
                        of commodities; and that a sound and liberal tariff policy would promote
                        such trade. He remarked, however, that sound tariff policies were only a
                        part of the needed program for adjustment of post war economic relations.
                        The economic strength and weakness and the potentialities of each nation
                        must be taken into consideration and a positive program worked out to meet
                        the needs. In this connection he mentioned Japan as a post war problem and
                        said that a wise policy should be followed in regard to its treatment after
                        the war. He also mentioned Indochina, saying that some solution would be
                        necessary in regard to that area. He referred particularly, as an
                        illustration, to the matter of control of the Yunnan-Indochina railway.</p>
                    <p>With regard to China’s internal problems, Dr. Tsiang deplored the tendency
                        toward government monopolization in China’s economic life. He said that he
                        did not consider the policy sound and conducive to healthy internal
                        development. He gave the salt monopoly as an illustration of what he
                        considered an unsound venture.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, Dr. Tsiang repeated his assertion that internal development
                        should be the Chinese Government’s chief post war job and added that, in the
                        foreign field, adjustment of relations with Russia would be essential.</p>

                            to be 4,282,000 square miles. This exceeds by over 600,000 square miles
                            the continental area of the United States. It represents a land mass
                            which would stretch east and west from the middle of the Caucasus
                            Mountains to Lisbon, north and south from the northernmost tip of Norway
                            to the bottom of the heel of Italy, northwest and southeast from the

                            4 and 5 times the population of the entire Japanese Empire. It is
                            roughly 3½ times the population of the United States.</item>

                                <item>The present Chinese governmental structure is of relatively
                                    recent origin. The spirit of nationalism in China which was in
                                    the process of development and organization under Chiang
                                    Kai-shek has received great impetus by the impact of Japan’s
                                    aggression and barbarities against the Chinese people.
                                    Nationalism in China is a growing force which is contributing
                                    steadily toward the development of a strong, unified nation. By
                                    Western standards there is at present too extensive provincial
                                    autonomy and more than usual inefficiency in the administration
                                    of the central government.</item>

                                <item>The military situation in China for the past five years has
                                    been in a constant state of flux with intermittent sallies and
                                    attacks by both sides; but in general it is characterized by
                                    Japanese advances and Chinese defensive retreats.</item>

                                <item>It is authoritatively estimated that China has slightly less
                                    than 3,000,000 regular soldiers in the field (not including
                                    organized and unorganized guerrillas). The Chinese armies lack
                                    air power. They have no effective air units with the exception
                                    of American volunteer forces. Chinese armies lack motorized and
                                    mechanized war equipment. Chinese armies lack heavy artillery.
                                    Faced by an enemy having such equipment, China is obviously
                                    unable and cannot be expected to open an offensive. Even
                                    defensive operations are in considerable measure impaired and
                                    imperiled by the lack of these arms.</item>

                                <item>The over-all strategy of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek
                                    represents defensive warfare on a scale probably more vast than
                                    ever before employed. (The operations of Soviet Russia would
                                    seem to be a combination of offensive and defensive tactics.)
                                    Chinese armies faced by superior military power put up stubborn
                                    resistance and eventually withdrew practically intact to the
                                    point where Japanese strategists considered it not worthwhile to
                                    press their attack. This withdrawal has been aided and Japanese
                                    occupation seriously hindered by the adoption of the tactics of
                                    “scorched earth” and of guerrilla warfare behind the lines. Such
                                    tactics were feasible and were achieving an appreciable amount
                                    of success in the war of attrition so long as China was able to
                                    obtain vital materials from abroad and to maintain its armies in
                                    the face of stringent economic and psychological conditions.
                                    Success of the Chinese military operations has depended in large
                                    part upon the maintenance among the Chinese in both occupied and
                                    unoccupied China of a high spirit of resistance.</item>

                                <item>World-wide hostilities and the isolation of China have
                                    resulted in an exacerbation of psychological and economic
                                    disabilities in China. Financial and economic power is weakened.
                                    Morale is threatened by a growing feeling of war-weariness and
                                    discouragement and was seriously dampened by the disillusionment
                                    which many Chinese felt <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0083"
                                    />when they witnessed the speed and success with which Japanese
                                    armed forces overcame British, Dutch and American arms in the
                                    Far East. The Chinese had felt reasonably certain that China’s
                                    position would become much stronger when Western powers became
                                    involved in war with Japan. Instead, the Chinese have found the
                                    position of China considerably worsened in an immediate sense

                                    and parts of Mongolia approximately 800,000 square miles of
                                    China. (This is a rough estimate based upon the location of
                                    front lines. Within this area there are large sections
                                    relatively free from Japanese control. There exist widespread
                                    and intermittent Chinese organized guerrilla activity and
                                    sabotage.) Japan’s invasion of China has resulted in Japanese
                                    control of all important coastal points of ingress and egress,
                                    of industrial and commercial centers, and of large sections of

                                    in China. There has emerged some Chinese leadership in occupied
                                    China acting in cooperation with Japan. The Japanese have been
                                    able to make valuable use of the local Chinese population in

                                    second, the vagueness and instability of numerous elements in
                                    the situation. These two characteristics make impossible

                                    situation in China, occupied or unoccupied. Accurate detailed

                                    prevented by increased confusion due to protracted and

                            the war in China in 1937 has had as its primary objective “the
                            settlement of the China incident.” Since early in 1939 the Japanese
                            people have been repeatedly and explicitly promised that the Government
                            would devote its best efforts to an attempt to bring about a cessation
                            of hostilities in China. The collapse of organized resistance in China
                            would undoubtedly give Japanese morale a great lift. Coupled with the
                            victories Japan has already won it would probably go far to steel the
                            Japanese public to meet later defeats and disasters with much greater
                            equanimity than could be expected if hostilities in China were to

                            would thereby gain the essential element which it lacks at present to
                            promote such psychological warfare, A collapse of China would
                            immeasurably contribute to the Axis’ psychological offensive against
                            India and the Middle East and would in all likelihood greatly facilitate
                            the Japanese effort to organize the populations of occupied countries
                            including China behind Japan’s war efforts. Psychologically Japan might
                            well obtain such a secure place as the leader of Asiatic races, if not
                            colored races of the world, that Japan’s defeat by the United Nations
                            might not be definitive.</item>

                        <item>It has been affirmed that Japan, even if organized Chinese resistance
                            should collapse, would be forced to keep large numbers of troops within
                            China. Apart from the considerable number of forces which Japan has need
                            for in its offensive thrusts as distinguished from operations in
                            connection with occupation, this is no doubt true and would be in
                            keeping with Japan’s plans for development as a great continental power.
                            However, it seems clear that the quantity and quality of Japan’s troops
                            and equipment in China could be reduced if organized Chinese resistance
                            were to collapse. Japan’s war potential would be thereby
                            increased.</item>

                            China would be slowed down if not obliterated. The strain on the morale
                            of Japanese troops in China would be immensely decreased once they were
                            free of the constant threat of organized attack on their often
                            weakly-held positions. Japanese troops would then face nothing more than
                            intermittent raids or uprisings by ill-equipped and uncoordinated
                            Chinese guerrillas or bandits. A comparison of tasks facing German
                            troops in insuring tranquillity in the prostrated countries of Europe
                            and their task in the guerrilla-infested areas of occupied Russia
                            illustrates the difference in the situation which Japan would face in
                            China were organized resistance to disappear there.</item>

                        <item>With the collapse of resistance from Chungking Japan would be enabled
                            immediately to strengthen and vitalize the Chinese political leadership
                            at Nanking and would thereby obtain relatively undisturbed access to the
                            important strategic materials and resources of all China. At the present
                            time Japan in exploiting China is subject to continual harassment and
                            non-cooperation coupled with a great measure of passive resistance. Were
                            Chungking to collapse, there might well come to the fore the age-old
                            Chinese spirit of accepting conditions as they are and of making the
                            best of them. The spirit of the new China which has had as its keynote
                            dogged resistance to Japan might die; it would certainly be driven
                            underground. In all probability Japan would then be enabled, with little
                            difficulty, to use the enormous manpower of China for economic, if not
                            military, purposes.</item>

                            their most important “aces.” It is not to be forgotten that Japan is

                            British tactics were defensive. Yet as long as Britain continued to
                            resist, Germany had not won and could not win. Similarly Chinese tactics
                            have been defensive. Yet as long as China continued to resist Japan had
                            not won and could not win. China is now also comparable in part to

                            only the advantages of an ally close by its enemy but would also remove

                                    munitions of war to the armies of Generalissimo Chiang

                                <p>“We remember that the Chinese people were the first to stand up
                                    and fight against the aggressors in this war; and in the future
                                    an unconquerable China will play its proper role in maintaining
                                    peace and prosperity not only in Eastern Asia but in the whole
                                    world.”</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>There has been deliberately omitted any attempt to discuss the technical
                        question of the ways and means of delivering aid to China. That problem is
                        one for qualified experts. This conclusion would be incomplete, however,
                        were emphasis not to be placed on the highly beneficial results which could
                        be accomplished in bolstering Chinese morale and tenacity in this war by the
                        establishment of a regularly-operated air link between China and its allies
                        to provide steady increments of material aid. A substitute for the Burma
                        Road is essential.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to state definitively the amount of aid necessary to keep
                        China in the war. It is reasonable to expect that if China remains isolated
                        and without concrete evidence (in the form of delivered <pb n="81"
                            xml:id="pg_81" facs="0091"/>goods to China and of a regularly-operated
                        link with the outside world) of our determination to implement our promises
                        of aid, China will be given further impetus toward disintegration. The
                        psychological factor is of great importance in keeping resistance alive in
                        China.</p>
                    <p>China’s war potential must be assessed not only in the negative values of
                        what China denies to Japan, but also in the positive values of what China
                        contributes to the total war effort. To these two important factors, there
                        must be added the possibility of eventually creating in China a
                        concentration of offensive military power to be released later conformably
                        with over-all strategy. Supplies to China sent now will not only meet
                        immediate and urgent needs but may become a part of later offensives.</p>
                    <p>In considering China’s war potential, the United States has to bear in mind
                        interests and policies differing in some respects from the interests and
                        policies which motivate some of the other United Nations.</p>
                    <p>Were the United Nations to disregard China in their over-all strategy, to
                        concentrate everything upon the defeat of Hitler, and to allow the situation
                        in the Far East to drift until, following the defeat of Hitler, full
                        attention could be directed to Japan and the Far East, a combination of
                        important developments and factors would make complete victory for our cause
                        over Japan’s cause extremely difficult if not even problematical. These
                        factors include: <list>

                            <item>Chinese resistance to Japan would probably collapse, bringing into
                                play the adverse developments already discussed in this memorandum.
                                As a result Japan might augment its internal strength in great
                                measure, might become firmly entrenched in China and other occupied
                                areas, and might establish a strong position of permanent leadership
                                of the colored races. The threat of a future world conflict between
                                the white and the colored races of the world might be
                                enhanced.</item>

                                area groups of peoples or nations friendlily disposed to the
                                democratic principles motivating the United Nations. This
                                development would seriously hamper the implementation of long-range
                                high policy of the United States in its foreign relations.</item>

                    <p>China’s over-all war potential is sufficiently great at the present moment to
                        warrant exceptional efforts on the part of the United States to keep China
                        in the war against Japan. The immediate objectives of successful prosecution
                        of the war against Japan warrant those efforts. The long-range policy of the
                        United States also warrants those efforts.</p>
                    <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0092"/>
                    <p>The psychological, military and political situation in China requires that
                        there be provided urgently tangible evidence in China of the practical
                        implementation of our decision to keep China in the war.</p>
                    <p>When there is added to the foregoing estimate consideration of the
                        possibility that the United Nations might be faced with disintegration and
                        collapse not only in China but also in Russia and in India, the vital
                        importance of maintaining the war potential of China is even more
                        apparent.</p>

                    <p>527. According to an Associated Press report dated Chungking June 16, a
                        Chinese Government spokesman admitted that Japanese forces driving eastward
                        and westward were within 80 miles of junction along the Chekiang-Kiangsi
                        Railway. It is understood that some time ago the Chinese removed rails and
                        possibly other equipment from this railway and used them in the construction
                        and operation of a railway from Hengyang to Kweilin. The Department would
                        appreciate receiving any information which may be available on this

                        estimate of their effect on the general situation in China.</p>
                    <p>The Department desires to be kept as fully informed as possible of current
                        developments and suggests that, for the time being, you telegraph at weekly

                                Embassy in China</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Macdonald</hi>)</head>
                        <p>I called on Mr. C. C. Chien yesterday afternoon regarding strategic
                            materials. Following our discussion he turned the conversation to
                            Sino-Soviet relations and gave his reasons why he considered war between
                            Russia and Japan highly desirable from China’s standpoint.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Chien said that China has not received any supplies from Russia for
                            the past year. It is his opinion that the Soviets are being ultra
                            cautious in order not to offend Japan by giving assistance to the
                            latter’s enemies. Consequently, according to Mr. Chien, Russia will not
                            give China permission to import supplies from abroad over the northwest
                            route. He added that China has experienced great difficulty in
                            negotiating with the Soviets in the past.</p>
                        <p>I inquired if all the material supplied by Russia has been transported
                            into China and whether China has fulfilled its barter agreements with
                            Russia. Mr. Chien replied in the affirmative to both questions.
                            (According to information from reliable sources, China has not fulfilled
                            its barter agreements with Russia. A considerable amount of Russian
                            material which was delivered at Hami and other points by Russia has been
                            waiting for some time to be transported south by the Chinese.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Chien said that if Stalin had been a good statesman he would have
                            declared war on Japan last December. Mr. Chien resents Russia’s present
                            argument that a second front in Europe should be established and said
                            that China also wants and needs a second front in Asia. According to him
                            there is no possibility that China will receive any assistance from
                            Russia until that country is involved in war with Japan. He thinks that
                            the Soviets will exert every effort to avoid hostilities with Japan but
                            feels confident that Japan will attack Russia thereby opening the second
                            front which he claims China desires so much.</p>
                        <p>I remarked that in the event of Russo-Japanese hostilities Russia might
                            require all supplies and means of transportation available to meet its
                            own requirements and, therefore, China would be no better off from that
                            standpoint. To this observation Mr. Chien replied that Russian
                            assistance will be forthcoming because China will be in a <pb n="84"
                                xml:id="pg_84" facs="0094"/>better position to negotiate as soon as
                            Russia becomes involved in war with Japan.</p>
                        <p>From Mr. Chien’s last remark it is quite obvious that China would open
                            negotiations on the basis that Chinese resistance might collapse unless
                            Russian assistance were received. At present such a threat probably
                            would not influence Russia, which is an important reason why China is so
                            anxious to see Russo-Japanese hostilities.</p>
                        <p>In this connection the question also arises whether China would make use
                            of any assistance received from Russia in prosecuting the present war.
                            One of the reasons why Russia has stopped sending materials to China is
                            due to the fact that China has not been making proper use of them in
                            resisting Japan.</p>

                    <p>The chief and a possibly fatal weakness in a theory of strategy which calls
                        for defeating Hitler first and then defeating Japan may be illustrated in a
                        figure as follows:</p>
                    <p>Jones is being attacked by a bull and a husky bull calf. Jones says to
                        himself that he will first deal with the bull and when he has finished off
                        the bull it will be easy to deal with and finish off the bull calf. Jones so
                        proceeds, concentrating on the bull. It takes two or three years to finish
                        off the bull. Meanwhile, the bull calf has been feeding on plenty of
                        nutritious diet well fortified with special vitamins. When, finally, Jones,
                        with great effort and with not a little loss of blood, has finished off the
                        bull and turns to deal with the calf, Jones finds that he is confronted not
                        by a calf but by a huskier bull than the one with which he has just dealt.
                        The calf has grown up—plenty.—At that point, Jones, wearied and weakened,
                        either lacks the will to take on a new, first class encounter or, if he then
                        tries to whip this second bull, finds the task even more difficult than that
                        which he has just finished of whipping the first bull.</p>
                    <p>The second fault in this theory of strategy is that it involves a risk of
                        losing China as an active participant in the United Nations’ resistance and
                        of permitting the creation in the Far East, before the hostilities in Europe
                        can be brought to a close, of a solid Japanese hegemony with China and India
                        incorporated in the body thereof: a phenomenon which, if it developed, would
                        be infinitely difficult to unscramble or to deal with on any basis of
                        reason.</p>

                    <p>The editorial minimizes the importance of the Japanese campaign, claiming
                        that it is to save “face” lost by the bombing of Tokyo and to cover up
                        Japan’s inability to undertake offensives against Australia, India, the
                        United States or Russia. It maintains that the initiative throughout the
                        campaign has been in Chinese hands, and reiterates the familiar theme that
                        the further Japan advances into China, the quicker and surer its defeat. The

                        and this explanation of Japanese advances as deliberate Chinese withdrawals
                        is the official propaganda line which is constantly held before the Chinese
                        people and the only one permitted to appear in print.</p>
                    <p>The same interpretation of military events in China has been well
                        propagandized abroad by China’s spokesmen, especially Madame Chiang
                        Kai-shek, as the Generalissimo’s “magnetic strategy”. It is so described,
                        for instance, in Madame Chiang’s address of June 14, 1942, to the alumnae of
                        Wellesley College.</p>
                    <p>The excerpts from the statement by General Liu, Deputy Chief of the Board of
                        Military Operations of the Military Affairs Commission, are interesting, not
                        only because they show a following of this line even in confidential
                        consultations with allied military representatives in Chungking, but also
                        because they reveal something of the apparently fundamental defensive bias
                        of Chinese military psychology. The Department may be interested in
                        referring to the full statement <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0097"/>which
                        is an enclosure to the Military Attaché’s report no. 72 (confidential) dated
                        June 22, 1942, to the Chief of Military Intelligence.<note n="44"
                            xml:id="d87fn3">Not found in Department files.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The General says, in effect: that the initiative remained in Chinese hands
                        because they withdrew according to plan; that if the Japanese continue to
                        advance, they will not be resisted; that Chinese refusal to give decisive
                        battle will keep Japanese forces in the area; that good Chinese troops were
                        not used because it was known that the Japanese were strong; and that
                        strategically the Japanese have not won a victory because they have not been
                        able to meet with (catch) the main Chinese force. Worthy of note are the
                        implied admissions that fighting has not been serious (despite the
                        extravagant Chinese communiqués which have been released daily and published
                        and commented on abroad).</p>
                    <p>Five years of withdrawals cannot but have an effect on Chinese psychology.
                        The man in the street is inclined to be a little skeptical of military
                        communiqués: experience has taught him how to evaluate them and to recognize
                        signs of another retreat. This partially accounts for panics such as
                        occurred in Kunming when Japanese troops began their drive into the province
                        of Yunnan: the average Chinese does not expect the Army to hold a line
                        against a Japanese drive. At the same time, he has had dinned into his ears
                        for five years this “magnetic strategy”; and experience has likewise taught
                        him that these successive Japanese victories (or Chinese withdrawals) do not
                        have particularly disastrous effects nor cause the end of resistance and
                        collapse of the country. Even Chinese victories such as those at Changsha
                        are explained in terms of magnetic tactics: the enemy is encouraged to
                        over-extend himself, then his weakened lines of communication are attacked
                        and his retreat threatened, forcing him to withdraw. The whole theory
                        appeals to the Chinese, whose traditional idea of warfare, derived from
                        fictionalized history in stories such as those of “The Three Kingdoms”, is
                        one of cunning, maneuver and strategy, rather than the frontal clash of
                        heavy forces.</p>
                    <p>In summary, the reaction of the average Chinese to military reverses is
                        complacence. It might be paraphrased as follows: “One can’t believe all the
                        communiqué—after all, the general must save his face. But it does seem
                        reasonable that if the Japanese advance too far, they will get themselves
                        into difficulties. Meanwhile the country will continue to be able to ‘take
                        it’. And help from America and other countries is going to beat Japan.”</p>
                    <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                                    effect that no munitions will be assigned to China during July

                        <item>Dr. Soong seemed be quite satisfied with the above statement of policy
                            but suggested that instructions be issued that production would not be
                            curtailed on any item now being manufactured for China. I told him that
                            I did not have the authority to make such a commitment as production
                            might be in excess of possible shipments. He did not press this point
                            further.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>After this telephone discussion with Dr. Soong I phoned General Aurand
                            and he told me that the only production item involved was 7.92 mm.
                            ammunition and that no instructions had been issued to stop production
                            although this is being given serious consideration at the present time
                            by the War Department because of the shortage of copper and also because
                            of the shipping situation. At the present time the War Department is
                            manufacturing approximately 35,000,000 rounds of this matériel per month
                            for China, the weight of which approximate 1,700 tons. I did not relay
                            this information to Dr. Soong, as both General Aurand and I felt that it
                            was not wise to make any further commitments at this time than are
                            necessary.</item>

                    <p>I find myself in a somewhat embarrassing position. I wired Madame Chiang that
                        you did not feel able to spare Harry Hopkins and suggested my going. She
                        replied, “Eagerly await your arrival for many problems can only be discussed

                        that he would see you next week. I was a bit taken aback as only a week ago
                        he voluntarily suggested my going to China, to which I gave a non-committal

                    <p>I have just received your message forwarded to me by General Stilwell.</p>
                    <p>The rapid advance of the Axis forces in the Middle East, suddenly confronted
                        the United Nations with a most critical situation. This movement, if not
                        stopped, will result in the severance of the Air Routes to India and China,
                        and seriously interfere with, if not interrupt, our sea lanes to India. It
                        is imperative that the Middle East be held. All reinforcements possible are
                        being rushed to block the Axis advance.</p>
                    <p>The urgency of the situation demanded that any and all means immediately
                        available be dispatched to preserve our lines of communication to the China
                        Theater. Accordingly the heavy bombers of the 10th Air Force were ordered to
                        the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>The diversion of these planes is a temporary measure compelled by this sudden
                        crisis. Upon arrival of sufficient air power to secure our lines of
                        communication, the planes will be returned to the 10th Air Force.</p>
                    <p>A decision has not been made as to the theater in which the squadron of A–29
                        light bombers now departing from the United States will be used. This
                        squadron has been ordered to await instructions at Khartoum. In the meantime
                        the medium bombardment and pursuit echelon of the 10th Air Force will
                        continue in the support of your Forces.</p>
                    <p>I reassure you that the United States and our allies do regard China as a
                        vital part of our common war effort and depend upon the maintenance of the
                        China Theater as an urgent necessity for the defeat of our enemies.</p>

                    <p>There are indications that there prevails among Army and Navy personnel, both
                        in Washington and at Chungking, who are interested in Far Eastern questions,
                        a greater degree of apprehension lest there occur in China in the immediate
                        future a collapse which would take China out of the war as an active
                        belligerent than prevails among the officers of this Department who are most
                        intimately concerned with the Far Eastern situation and its problem.—What
                        may be the official War Department and Navy Department opinion is another
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>The existence of the opinion in Army and Navy circles that China may
                        collapse, and collapse soon, gives rise to a feeling of defeatism with
                        regard to China which must inevitably influence reasoning in those circles
                        as to the advisability and practicability of sending military aid to the
                        Chinese. It must contribute to the formulation of an opinion that to send
                        such aid would be to take undue risks of losing materials sent—without the
                        sending of them having accomplished any useful purpose. This must tend to
                        influence procedure: it must tend to cause delays or to cause arrival at
                        decisions not to send matériel.</p>
                    <p>But, the danger of a Chinese collapse flows in part from and is greatly
                        increased by the fact that the Chinese are not receiving matériel. If
                        collapse of China were to occur, that collapse would be due in no small
                        measure to the fact that supplies from abroad (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                        have not followed upon and made good the promises which have been given that
                        supplies will be sent and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) have not become
                        available to the Chinese forces as matériel for the continuance of their
                        resistance and the building up of an ultimately intended offensive.
                        Notwithstanding their extraordinary patience, the Chinese are subject to the
                        effects of disappointment, of a sense of frustration, of a feeling that they
                        are not appreciated, of an ultimate conclusion that one cannot fight forever
                        without weapons—just as are other people.</p>
                    <p>It is the belief of the Far Eastern officers of this Department and of the
                        American Ambassador at Chungking that a Chinese collapse is not an imminent
                        likelihood; that, however, continued Chinese resistance cannot be taken for
                        granted; <hi rend="italic">that the best way to insure against a Chinese
                            collapse lies in the field of sending materials, especially planes, and
                            establishing of an effective air transport into and out of China;</hi>
                        that investment in this type of insurance is warranted <pb n="91"
                            xml:id="pg_91" facs="0101"/>even though it may be slightly speculative;
                        that the Chinese resistance is an asset and cessation of Chinese resistance
                        would be a great loss to the United Nations effort.</p>
                    <p>We therefore continue to recommend and to urge that every reasonable effort
                        be made to maintain effective physical communication with China; that this
                        effort take the form of an endeavor to establish on a substantial scale air
                        transport between India and China; and that, unless and until it is <hi

                        policy be directed intensively toward establishing this transport and
                        getting planes, materials, military equipment of most needed types, and some
                        American air personnel and various types of military and civilian experts
                        into China—with intention of increasing the amounts and numbers as
                        availability thereof develops.</p>

                    <p>The Chinese Ambassador called at my request. I remarked that I had intended
                        to invite him to come to see me yesterday, but that a funeral which I
                        attended had prevented my doing so.</p>
                    <p>I asked the Ambassador how long China would continue to fight and he
                        unhesitatingly replied that they would keep on. He added that he felt that
                        just as Russia is gradually checkmating the German plans and military
                        movements, particularly during the last year, China is in a similar position
                        with respect to Japan.</p>

                    <p>Loss of larger Chinese airfields in Chekiang and Kiangsi deprives us of bases
                        which were important for an air offensive against Japan <pb n="92"
                            xml:id="pg_92" facs="0102"/>and Formosa. Chinese military officers
                        charge failure of Chinese forces to hold those areas to lack of air support
                        which China has been expecting from United States.</p>
                    <p>General Stilwell tells me that when he recently informed General Chiang of
                        diversion to Middle East of certain air units intended for China Chiang
                        showed extreme irritation and asked that Washington be informed of his
                        desire to know whether China theater is still regarded as meriting aid so
                        that he may plan for future while Madame Chiang who was present at
                        conversation remarked in an aside in English that this implied possibility
                        of peace with Japan, a remark which I am firmly convinced merely represents
                        her own impatient and captious attitude rather than any serious thought on
                        part of Chiang or on her own part of any move for such a peace.</p>
                    <p>Chinese reaction[s] to general war situation follow trend of fortunes of
                        United Nations and at moment there are indications of discouragement and
                        irritation.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy has noted a revival of speculation as to possibility of separate
                        peace between China and Japan but it has been unable to obtain any
                        information pointing to peace discussions in any responsible quarter. All
                        commentators agree that it is entirely out of the question that General
                        Chiang could under any circumstances be induced to consider any such
                        proposals. In general in all responsible quarters there is continued
                        confidence in ultimate victory for United Nations.</p>
                    <p>While according to reports China’s requisitions under Lend-Lease call for
                        much more than can reasonably be expected to be spared or to be used
                        effectively in China at this time, it is evident that there is real need of
                        air support and of munitions. The requirements for China theater are
                        understood not to be extensive in comparison with those for other areas and
                        it would seem desirable to meet China’s actual needs with least possible
                        delay.</p>
                    <p>The all out Japanese offensive in China which was scare headlined after the
                        fall of Burma has not yet materialized but sober military and other
                        observers point out that increased Japanese pressure on China is a real
                        possibility within next few months if Japan does not become involved in a
                        sub[sequent effort on ma]jor fronts elsewhere. While Embassy deprecates
                        defeatist attitude taken by some of our military men after fall of Burma, it
                        does recommend that possibility of serious developments in China theater be
                        borne in mind in connection with air support and munitions and supplies for
                        China.</p>

                        through the agency of the Office of War Information as part of a program
                        commemorating July 7: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Five years ago today China took up arms in defense of its Soil
                                against renewed Japanese aggression. Since that time the Chinese
                                people have been ceaselessly and courageously battling for their
                                liberty against the ruthless invaders. The American people have
                                watched with deep sympathy and admiration the heroic fortitude and
                                tenacity with which for five long and bitter years the Chinese
                                people have fought on against heavy odds.</p>
                            <p>On the occasion of this anniversary I desire to convey to you and
                                through you to the Chinese people an expression of the wholehearted
                                good wishes of the American people who, as comrades-in-arms with the
                                Chinese people, are now facing common aggressors and share a common
                                peril. We realize that the way before us is beset with formidable
                                difficulties. We shall not falter. China’s determination to continue
                                resolutely and valiantly as a leader in the fight for freedom
                                constitutes an inspiring part of the unshakeable unity of purpose of
                                the United Nations. The consciousness of those nations of the
                                justness of their cause, their resolve to make all necessary
                                sacrifices, and their firm purpose to carry home to the enemy the
                                war which he has rapaciously inflicted upon humanity make certain
                                final victory.”</p>

                    <p>591. Chiang Kai-shek has asked the President to send Mr. Harry Hopkins or
                        some other similarly situated person to Chungking to confer in person with
                        Chiang Kai-shek. The President has decided to send Mr. Lauchlin Currie,
                        Administrative Assistant to the President, on this mission. Mr. Currie will
                        probably proceed to China very shortly. He is endeavoring to depart without
                        publicity here.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Currie has worked in close cooperation with officers of the Department in
                        various matters relating to China. He is, as you know, specially versed in
                        matters relating to the extension of lend-lease aid to China. He is informed
                        with regard to most recent developments here, especially as they relate to
                        China, and it is believed that you will find most helpful the information
                        which he will be in position to give <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0105"
                        />you in regard to the situation here and current thought in high Government
                        circles.</p>
                    <p>Upon his arrival Mr. Currie expects to confer with you and to obtain from you
                        the benefit of such comments and suggestions as you may consider likely to
                        be helpful. You and the members of your staff will of course assist him in
                        every practicable way.</p>
                    <p>You need take no initiative in informing the Chinese Government of Mr.
                        Currie’s forthcoming visit in as much as Dr. Soong has been informed and
                        presumably has telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Generalissimo</hi>: Mr. Currie’s visit affords
                        me an opportunity to return the greetings you sent me<note n="59"
                            xml:id="d97fn59">Not printed.</note> on Mr. Lattimore’s return. I was
                        glad to learn that you find his work helpful to you. I have always regarded
                        him as both a good American and a good friend of China and I share your
                        confidence in his complete integrity. His intimate knowledge of the Chinese
                        scene has been of great assistance to us.</p>
                    <p>I gave serious study to your request that Mr. Hopkins visit you for a
                        personal talk. Mr. Hopkins was eager to go and I should have liked to have
                        been able to send him. Various compelling considerations, however, finally
                        and reluctantly forced me to withhold my assent. His health is not robust
                        and the trip is a long and arduous one at this time of year. Moreover, he is
                        playing a most vital role in the war effort here, and I did not feel that I
                        could spare him for an extended period.</p>
                    <p>I have, therefore, asked Mr. Currie to resume his earlier and most profitable
                        talks with you. Mr. Currie has my complete confidence, has access to me at
                        all times, and has quietly and in the background been active on all phases
                        of Sino-American relations—military, political and economic—since his last
                        visit to China. He will, I am confident, faithfully and accurately convey my
                        specific views and general attitudes to you, and yours to me. It will be the
                        next best thing to our having personal talks, which I hope will not be too
                        long deferred.</p>
                    <p>There is one apparent misunderstanding which I am most anxious to have
                        cleared up. Since we are fundamentally of the same mind and our countries
                        have common objectives both in the war and in the post-war period, I feel
                        that I can speak frankly and freely to you. I was greatly disturbed and
                        upset by a recent cable from you which <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0106"
                        />intimated that the China theater was no longer regarded here as meriting
                        attention. The simple truth of the matter is that we are doing absolutely
                        all in our power to help China win this war just as we are helping Britain
                        and all the other United Nations to win this war. For you to entertain any
                        thoughts to the contrary leads me to feel that you may not appreciate the
                        strategic picture as it appears to me.</p>
                    <p>In the past six months it was impossible to prevent Japanese advances and the
                        capture of the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, and Burma. This
                        impossibility arose simply from the element of geography. During this period
                        the first thing to do was to limit the extent of the Japanese advances in
                        order to hold the South Pacific, to prevent us from being bottled up in the
                        United States and to prevent control by Japan of all seaborne commerce in
                        the Pacific and Indian Oceans.</p>
                    <p>This seemed to have been successfully accomplished until ten days ago and
                        then a most unfortunate and unexpected development occurred. As I write this
                        letter Egypt, the Suez Canal, Palestine, Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Iran, and
                        even Ethiopia are all threatened with capture by the Germans and Italians. A
                        simple glance at a map will show that if this happens American aid to China
                        will be practically eliminated because of German and Japanese domination of
                        the Indian Ocean, Persian Gulf and Bay of Bengal.</p>
                    <p>I am sure that in the light of the current situation you would not want the
                        United States at this critical juncture to give no aid to Britain and Egypt
                        since this would jeopardize the whole of the Far East. If you had been in my
                        place, attempting to look at the war in its global aspects, I am sure that
                        you would have done everything possible to bolster our position in the Near
                        East. Your interest in China alone, I feel confident, would have led you to
                        divert a few planes from the Indian theater.</p>
                    <p>You have yourself suggested the desirability of a single unified command for
                        the whole war. For various and cogent reasons this is not possible to
                        establish in any formal sense. By virtue of the American position, however,
                        I am to a large extent filling that role. It is in this role that I have, as
                        a matter of emergency, sanctioned the diversion of a few available planes
                        from the Indian-China theater, even though earlier, before the emergency
                        arose, I had felt that no diversion would be necessary.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Currie comes to you at a most critical and anxious time for all of us,
                        and for you in particular. I have no doubt whatever of the ultimate victory
                        of our cause. I am only grieved that our allies should have to bear the
                        major brunt of the fighting in the next few months.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Roosevelt joins me in extending our warmest personal regards to you and
                        Madame Chiang.</p>

                    <p>793. Reports have reached the Embassy and the Military and Naval Attachés
                        from Chinese sources that General Whang, Air Attaché of the Chinese Embassy
                        at Washington who recently returned to Chungking, has stated to Chinese that
                        officials at Washington are very free in showing telegrams and reports from
                        American official sources at Chungking to officials of the Chinese Embassy
                        and other establishments. This is not the first indication we have had of
                        leakages at Washington. There is evidence that the opinion is held in high
                        Chinese quarters that unfavorable or critical reports have been sent to
                        Washington by American officials at Chungking.<note n="60" xml:id="d98fn60"
                            >In his telegram No. 269, February 21, 1943, 10 a.m. (711.93/521),
                            Ambassador Gauss reported the Embassy “learns from responsible source
                            that prominent Chinese here has asserted that much of confidential
                            information coming to State Department from Far East reaches Dr.
                            Rajchman in employ of T. V. Soong.” L. W. Rajchman was formerly Polish
                            director of League of Nations Health Section.</note> The Chinese are
                        supersensitive to all criticism. This situation is most embarrassing to all
                        American officials at Chungking endeavoring to keep Washington informed
                        honestly and frankly of factual conditions in this country. We find our
                        sources of information blocked and there is also evidence of tampering with
                        Embassy mail. I urge that all officials at Washington receiving copies of

                        <p>The attached memoranda of conversations in Chungking are summarized and
                            commented upon in the following paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>Both Communist and Kuomintang officials interviewed anticipated a
                            Japanese attack on Siberia in the near future. This expectation appeared
                            to be based upon a belief that (1) Japan must round out its defensive
                            position, therefore the threat of Siberia must be eliminated; (2) as the
                            defeat of Germany would have disastrous effects upon Japan, a Japanese
                            attack on Siberia to ensure a prompt German victory over the Soviet
                            Union is indicated; and (3) time is operating against the Japanese,
                            consequently they must act promptly.</p>
                        <p>None of the Chinese interviewed suggested that the outbreak of
                            Russo-Japanese hostilities would be seized by the Chinese as an
                            opportunity for taking offensive action against the Japanese. The
                            Communists anticipated, in the event of a Russo-Japanese war, a
                            determined Central Government effort to crush the Communist forces in
                            Ningsia, Shensi and Shansi.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese interviewed all displayed what was to me, after talking to
                            some of our officers, a strange confidence that the Japanese would not
                            and could not knock out China. Chou En-lai said, and I think accurately,
                            that even though the Generalissimo were forced to fall back into
                            northwest China he would never capitulate to the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Relations between the Central Government and the Communists would appear
                            to have deteriorated. Chou En-lai and Madame Sun were definite in their
                            statements that relations between the two sides had worsened with the
                            tightening of the Central Government’s blockade of the Communist area.
                            General Chou declared that 441,000 Central Government troops were
                            enforcing the blockade. Dr. Sun Fo and Mr. T. C. Lin sought to minimize
                            the significance of the blockade and suggested that the Communist forces
                            could not be considered effective and modern fighters.</p>
                        <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0110"/>
                        <p>This general picture of mutual distrust and antipathy between the two
                            principal Chinese factions together with the apparent reluctance, with
                            which you are familiar, of the Government to expend its strength against
                            the Japanese lends color to Chou En-lai’s suggestion that the Central
                            Government military authorities are conserving their strength out of
                            domestic political consideration and leaving offensive action against
                            the Japanese primarily to the United States and the British Empire. In
                            this connection Madame Sun observed that the Central Government military
                            leaders were interested in problems closer to home than the retaking of
                            Burma.</p>
                        <p>General Chou and Mr. Chang Han-fu, the Communist editor, reacted
                            significantly to the subject of Chinese Government hints which have been
                            made from time to time of impending capitulation and the resultant
                            extension of American military and financial aid. The former remarked
                            that the Chinese intimations were made for the effect which they
                            produced. The latter asked why we did not call the bluffs.</p>
                        <p>It is not unlikely that their attitude reflects a belief that American
                            material aid to the Chinese Government will someday be turned against
                            the Communists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Tsiang Ting-fu, Political Vice-Minister of the Executive Yuan, said
                            on June 27 that the Generalissimo’s attitude was that India should
                            immediately be granted independence and that General Chiang had not
                            hesitated to let the British know his position in the matter. Dr. Sun
                            seemed to hold some rather vague and not well-founded ideas on the
                            Indian problem. In contrast, the Communists and Madame Sun appeared to
                            be aware of the complexity of the problem. This was probably due in a
                            large measure to their realization that the Indian National Congress and
                            the Muslim League are reactionary on virtually every issue save that of
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. T. C. Lin’s forecast on the European war envisaged an Anglo-American
                            race against the Russians to Berlin. He also warned against the
                            development of a situation at the termination of the war in which the
                            Soviet Union would again feel itself isolated and compelled to build up
                            armaments sufficient to repel any possible combination of enemies. In
                            such a situation he foresaw the possibility of an Anglo-Japanese
                            understanding.</p>
                        <p>From my conversation with Mr. Tsiang and Mr. Lin I derived the impression
                            that these two gentlemen and the influential group in the Central
                            Government which they, in a minor capacity, represent are acutely aware
                            of the manoeuvering by each of the United Nations (excepting perhaps the
                            United States) to husband its military strength so that it may arrive at
                            the peace table with its maximum bargaining power. My guess is that the
                            Chinese Government is withholding <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101"
                                facs="0111"/>offensive action against the Japanese and conserving
                            its strength out of international as much as domestic political
                            considerations.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Conversation With Chou En-lai</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>General Chou En-lai, Communist representative at Chungking, was
                            recovering from an operation when I saw him at the Central Hospital on
                            June 29.</p>
                        <p>Since the beginning of the Pacific War, General Chou stated, he has not
                            been called in for consultation with the Central Government authorities.
                            During the past three weeks, as the expectation of a Japanese attack on
                            Siberia increased, the Central Government’s blockade of the Communist
                            area in the northwest has tightened. General Hu Tsung-nan commands an
                            army of 441,000 maintaining this blockade. Twice I tried to lead him out
                            on what the Communist reaction would be to the withdrawal of substantial
                            numbers of Central Government troops from the blockade. His replies were
                            not clear beyond that he believed such action unlikely, but that if it
                            were taken the Communists would probably return eastward.</p>
                        <p>General Chou did not anticipate a Japanese attack on Kunming. He pointed
                            out that the Japanese knew that the decisive subjugation of China would
                            be a never-ending task and, in effect, that more important objectives
                            still lay before them. Current Japanese operations he regarded as an
                            interim campaign preceding a major effort against either Siberia or
                            India. An attack on Siberia he considered to be more likely.</p>
                        <p>Although General Chou did not expect Kunming to be attacked and occupied
                            by the Japanese, he said that if the capital of Yunnan were taken, he
                            would expect the Generalissimo to withdraw to Lanchow. He declared that
                            others may be able to seek peace with the Japanese, but never the
                            Generalissimo. He remarked with a significant smile that rumors of the
                            Chinese being prepared to accept Japanese peace offers were staged for
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>In commenting on General Ho Ying-chin, the Communist representative said
                            that General Ho’s objective was to conserve the military strength of the
                            Central Government, leaving the defeat of Japan to the United States and
                            Great Britain. If Germany, however, emerged victorious over the United
                            States and Great Britain he was also prepared <pb n="102"
                                xml:id="pg_102" facs="0112"/>to come to terms with the Germans. In
                            any event the Minister of War was opposed to the expenditure of the
                            Central Government’s military power; it would be needed after the
                            termination of the war with Japan. Therefore to any program for military
                            action General Ho could be expected to present objections and discover
                            obstacles in the way.</p>
                        <p>According to General Chou, not more than 600,000 troops at the most would
                            acknowledge the personal leadership of General Ho, as against some
                            2,500,000 which the Generalissimo can personally depend upon. The
                            Communist leader said, “General Ho can command some Szechuan troops, he
                            can command the Yunnan troops—perhaps—and he can command a part of Ku
                            Chu-tung’s armies; that’s all.” The War Minister’s power lies, General
                            Chou explained, obviously not in the relatively weak forces which might
                            respond to his command, but in his administrative hold developed over a
                            period of more than a decade.</p>
                        <p>The Indian problem interested General Chou. He asked many questions.
                            Apparently he had no sympathy for the Congress and was visibly amused by
                            the incongruity of the tacit alliance in India between British colonial
                            imperialists and the Communists.</p>
                        <p>Unified command is the most important factor, General Chou stated with
                            emphasis, in any attempt to retake Burma. He said half laughingly half
                            seriously that if the Generalissimo would permit him, he would take
                            Communist troops under his command for a Burma campaign and “I would
                            obey General Stilwell’s orders!”</p>

                    <p>812. The various messages and addresses made by Chinese officials to the
                        Chinese people on the “double seventh” were characterized by a calm
                        confidence and by a determination to see the war through to a successful
                        conclusion.</p>
                    <p>General Chiang spoke of the responsibilities which collaboration with the
                        United Nations imposed upon China, dealt particularly with America’s
                        supremely important duty in the Pacific from a naval point of view, warned
                        against giving credence to reports that allied strategy accorded the Pacific
                        war a place of second importance and urged Chinese “to depend on yourselves
                        to exert your utmost to fulfill your duty”.</p>
                    <p>General Ho Ying-chin said that, with increased foreign aid, the “morale of
                        the Chinese army was never higher”; that on the Kiangsi-Chekiang <pb n="103"
                            xml:id="pg_103" facs="0113"/>front the Japanese had scored only local
                        victories; and that Chinese forces remained intact and ready to counter
                        attack.</p>
                    <p>Finance Minister Kung spoke with confidence of China’s ability, with foreign
                        financial assistance and internal measures, to meet her economic
                        difficulties. Rise of prices constituted the most serious problem, he said,
                        and promised to meet it through price regulation, restriction of bank credit
                        and increased productions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Sun Fo predicted victory and restoration to China of all territory lost
                        since the Sino-Japanese war of 1894. With regard to postwar reconstruction,
                        he stated that China has still far to go toward the consummation of
                        democracy politically, economically and socially.</p>
                    <p>Chen Li-fu, Minister of Education, pointed out that China’s resistance is no
                        myth or miracle; that it is based on determination, hatred of the enemy and
                        staunch war effort. “China will never compromise with Japan,” he said.</p>
                    <p>While allowance must be made for the fact that these statements are for
                        public consumption on a significant anniversary, the Embassy considers them
                        a reflection somewhat exaggerated of a sincere Chinese feeling that China
                        will be able to weather the storm and come through victorious with the other
                        United Nations. Vincent returning from Yunnanfu states that he found a
                        similar feeling among the officials and businessmen with whom he conversed
                        there.</p>

                            engaged in a common struggle in concert with other anti-aggression
                            nations. This constitutes a most memorable event in the long history of
                            cordial relations between our two countries. The Chinese army and people
                            will long remember your message in praise of China’s war effort, and we
                            will surely spur ourselves to further endeavors in the fulfillment of
                            our duties in order to bring about the defeat of the brutal aggressors
                            for the common good of our two countries and all the other United
                            Nations.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose for the
                        information of the Department, a memorandum prepared by the Counselor of the
                        Embassy, Mr. John Carter Vincent, on the subject of continuation of Chinese
                        resistance to Japan and the suggestions that if American support for China
                        is not forthcoming in the measure China expects consideration might be given
                        to peace with Japan.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy has long been of the opinion that little more could be expected
                        from China in the present war than continued resistance with the object of
                        containing in this country a substantial Japanese military force which might
                        otherwise be used elsewhere against the United Nations. I believe that the
                        major battles of the war of the United Nations will be fought in other
                        theaters. I have recognized that China might afford a springboard for aerial
                        offensives against Japan from air bases in eastern China—Chekiang and
                        Kiangsi—provided those bases could be supplied with aviation fuel, bombs and
                        service facilities; but those air bases have recently been lost to the hands
                        of the Japanese. Incidentally, the Chinese charge that the loss of these
                        bases is due largely to lack of air support for the Chinese armies in the
                        Kiangsi-Chekiang area; air support which had been expected from the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>For the time being at least, there remains in this theater of the war the one
                        important problem of continuation of Chinese resistance to Japan; and
                        effective resistance, not only to the measure of Japanese resistance which
                        has been experienced in the past but to the greater pressure which Japan may
                        at any time bring to bear for the settlement of the “China Incident”.
                        Military and other observers have long maintained that if Japan had been
                        disposed to throw into China heavily increased forces, with air support on a
                        larger scale, Chinese <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0115"/>resistance
                        could readily be crushed. But for over four years, Japan has been husbanding
                        the Japanese military strength for the greater program of aggression on
                        which that country has now embarked.</p>
                    <p>With the success of the Japanese offensive southward, it now remains to be
                        seen in what direction Japan will turn in the near future. If Japan becomes
                        involved in a substantial way in major offensives against Siberia, India, or
                        Australia, it is not likely that increased Japanese pressure can be applied
                        at this time on China; but unless Japan does so become involved in other
                        directions, it is to be expected that added pressure on China will develop,
                        and I do not believe that, without reasonable outside support, China will be
                        able effectively to resist such Japanese military pressure.</p>
                    <p>China of course cannot service any large air force; but it does have the
                        facilities to service a reasonable number of fighter and bomber planes,
                        operated by American personnel; and a reasonably strong air force would give
                        substantial backbone and aid to the Chinese military forces in defensive
                        operations against Japanese pressure and in harassing tactics against
                        Japanese positions and lines of supply and communication in this country.
                        Air operations against the Japanese in China, independent of the operations
                        of the Chinese ground forces, would also be capable of rendering results
                        commensurate with the force available for the purpose. China is also in need
                        of munitions and materials for the manufacture of munitions, without which
                        the Chinese ground forces cannot be expected to continue resistance for an
                        indefinite period.</p>
                    <p>I believe that an effort should be made without delay to give China
                        reasonable American air support and to maintain and develop air transport
                        facilities capable of providing a continuing supply of munitions and
                        materials for the manufacture of munitions. With such support, I believe
                        that China can reasonably be expected to continue effective resistance to
                        the Japanese in China and even to increased Japanese pressure in this
                        country. As the war continues, however, and Chinese reserves are depleted
                        and morale deteriorates, I do not believe that continued effective Chinese
                        military resistance to Japan can be expected to continue without outside
                        support.</p>

                        <p>The “question” of a continuation of resistance by the Chinese has been
                            raised again in the recent conversation between General Stilwell <pb
                                n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0116"/>and Generalissimo and Madame
                                Chiang.<note n="67" xml:id="d103fn67">For further correspondence on
                                this, see memorandum of conversation, July 11, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >infra.</hi>
                            </note> Although there are in the situation factors, phases and
                            angles—psychological as well as factual; personal as well as
                            political—which must be considered, it is possible nevertheless to offer
                            a reasonably satisfactory answer.</p>
                        <p>First, it is believed that the answer to the question is to be found in
                            the internal situation rather than in external circumstances; that is,
                            ruling out the possibility of allied reverses so serious that the
                            Chinese lose confidence in an allied victory (losses such as Tobruk are
                            a shock but they do not appear to shake confidence in ultimate victory),
                            the continuation of resistance does not depend upon the reception of
                            allied aid, as General Chiang implied and Madame Chiang stated in their
                            conversation with General Stilwell. Chinese in a position to assess the
                            potentialities do not, I believe, consider that the amount of assistance
                            that can be brought into China now or in the near future can have any
                            decisive result—can in fact effect a material change in the situation.
                            Neither air support nor artillery in sufficient force to make possible
                            an offensive can, in the case of air units, be maintained in China and,
                            in the case of artillery, be brought into China. Small arms and
                            ammunition are needed but are not essential to a continuation of
                            resistance of the kind that has characterized the hostilities in China
                            for the past two years. Hence the attitude adopted by Generalissimo and
                            Madame Chiang toward the recent diversion of planes and other supplies
                            from China has its explanation more in face than in the actual facts of
                            the situation. American planes would be useful in China: they are in no
                            sense vital to a continuation of resistance. The statements made
                            therefore by General and Madame Chiang, while worthy of serious
                            consideration, should not be cause for alarm.</p>
                        <p>When the Generalissimo says, as General Stilwell reports, that he wants
                            to know whether the United States continues to consider China as a real
                            theatre of war in order that he may know what course China should follow
                            in the future and when Madame Chiang explains that the Generalissimo
                            means whether China should come to terms with Japan, the question
                            arises: Who is going to come to terms with the Japanese?</p>
                        <p>There are three possibilities. General Chiang might come to terms.
                            General Chiang, and the family and political intimates supporting him,
                            might voluntarily retire from the scene and permit others less committed
                            to resistance to come to terms. Or, Chiang and his immediate associates
                            might be forced to retire by those desirous of coming to terms with
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>The possibility that Chiang might come to terms with the Japanese is so
                            slight that I believe it can be dismissed. Chiang, as the Embassy has
                            stated on several occasions, is irrevocably committed to resistance. <pb
                                n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0117"/>Unity and resistance are the
                            two pillars of his policy. Through the latter he has achieved a large
                            degree of the former. He could not give up the one and retain the other
                            under his leadership. And there is also the personal equation. Chiang
                            envisages himself as one of the four great leaders on the allied war
                            front. As such he can demand support but he cannot seriously consider
                            abandoning the fight.</p>
                        <p>The possibility that Chiang and his immediate adherents might voluntarily
                            step aside in order to permit others to come to terms with the Japanese
                            is merely a possibility. It is in no sense a probability largely for the
                            reasons cited in the preceding paragraph which apply forcefully, if less
                            directly, to the contingency of voluntary retirement. Chiang would have
                            everything to lose and nothing to gain by such a gesture. Furthermore,
                            the question of voluntary retirement presupposes the existence of a
                            group capable of leading the country and government to the acceptance of
                            terms with Japan. This supposition leads to consideration of the third
                            possibility.</p>
                        <p>Under certain contingencies, it is possible that a group in the
                            government less committed to resistance than Chiang might be able to
                            force his retirement and come to terms with the Japanese. This
                            possibility could only become a probability should the allied fortunes
                            of war fall so low as to undermine general confidence in an allied
                            victory. At present there exists no group within or without the
                            government or party capable of initiating and pursuing a policy contrary
                            to that of Chiang. In fact it is doubtful if there exist within the
                            government individuals of importance who have a desire to oppose Chiang.
                            The most powerful men in the government in their various fields—(Chen
                            Li-fu, Minister of Education, and with his brother Chen Kuo-fu, the
                            leader of the influential “C-C” clique; H. H. Kung, controller of the
                            finances of the country; Chang Chun, Governor of Szechuan and leader of
                            the “political science” group of officials who, although oriental in
                            their outlook, are not pro-Japanese; Ho Ying-chin, Minister of Military
                            Administration and “elder officer” of the Whampoa military academy
                            clique which has much influence in the army; and Tai Li, chief of the
                            Chinese gestapo with a large “army” of political agents and also
                            “Whampoa”)—these men or the groups they lead are not inclined to oppose
                            the Generalissimo even though they may not be as determined upon
                            resistance as the Generalissimo. They are, in fact, bound to the
                            Generalissimo by bonds of personal loyalty in varying degrees which
                            seems to preclude their taking action against him. Their importance in
                            the political picture lies in the role they play in the government <hi

                            Chiang fortuitously be removed from the picture rather than in any role
                            they might play in opposition to Chiang. Chiang is not a dictator but
                            Chiang is so astute a politician <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0118"
                            />and manager that he has been able to maintain control over the various
                            groups, preserving a certain bond with each and playing one off against
                            another when and where necessary.</p>
                        <p>There is another important angle of the situation which must be mentioned
                            in connection with discussion in the foregoing paragraph. Although
                            public opinion in China is not well organized or vocal, it is in fact
                            committed to resistance and it is doubtful, even should there be a group
                            or a combination of groups within the government desirous of setting
                            themselves up in opposition to Chiang and coming to terms with the
                            Japanese, that such a group could carry opinion among the rank and file
                            of the country and the army with them. More likely they would bring
                            chaos—or a degree of disunity close to chaos. Furthermore, it would be
                            extremely difficult to “sell” the people on the idea of peace with Japan
                            because they could be shown very little in the way of practical benefits
                            that would accrue therefrom.</p>
                        <p>It is clear from the foregoing, I think, that there is actually little
                            “question” in present circumstances of a discontinuation of Chinese
                            resistance; that resistance will be continued upon its present and past
                            “non-offensive” basis; and that any move or inciting of a move for terms
                            with the Japanese is so remote a possibility that it is hardly worth
                            consideration. Confidence in an allied victory persists generally and
                            may be relied upon to continue unless shaken by reverses of considerable
                            magnitude. It is true (as a sidelight) that there is a large and
                            influential body of Chinese officials who would view a Russian land
                            victory in Asia over Japan with hardly less misgiving than a Japanese
                            victory over Russia but this feeling is not shared by most people in and
                            out of the Government.</p>
                        <p>Although terms with Japan may be ruled out, there are possibilities in
                            the situation less spectacular and decisive that cannot be. One of these
                            is the possibility that there may be a peripheral disintegration of
                            authority and disaffection should confidence in allied victory be
                            weakened. Further deterioration in the economic situation might have a
                            like effect. Provincial leaders such as Yu Han-mou in Kwangtung, Lung
                            Yun in Yunnan, and Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi might be persuaded that
                            association with the Japanese puppet regime at Nanking would be more
                            advantageous to them than continued loyalty to Chiang. I do not think
                            this will occur but it is a possibility that cannot be overlooked, and
                            it is a possibility with which the Chungking Government would be
                            ill-prepared to cope. And there is another element in the situation.
                            Under the influence of those in government who have little sympathy with
                            western concepts of democratic government, who have a fear of Chinese
                            communism which beclouds their judgment, and who are intent upon
                            conserving the dominant position of the Kuomintang now and after the
                            war, the <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0119"/>government might be
                            persuaded to reduce its resistance to a minimum in order to conserve
                            military strength for the future. In such a contingency, Chinese
                            insistence upon receiving assistance from us might prove a greater
                            embarrassment to us, viewing the war globally, than to the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Embassy’s view has been and I think should continue to
                            be that China should be given all practical assistance—practical from
                            the standpoint of ability effectively to utilize such assistance in
                            China, practical from the standpoint of transportation facilities, and
                            practical from the standpoint of needs in other theatres of the war.
                            Assistance should not be given because of a fear that failure to do so
                            would result in the Chinese authorities’ ceasing resistance and seeking
                            peace with Japan.</p>

                        conversations at Chungking between the Japanese and the Chinese. (Colonel
                        Mayer recently reported that the Russian Military Attaché had informed him
                        that a Japanese is now in South Hot Springs, Chungking, and is the bearer of
                        peace proposals along the lines of those made by Prince Konoye when Prime

                    <p>I told General Stilwell that I had noted Colonel Mayer’s report, and its
                        source, and had found it interesting, but I attached no particular
                        importance to it. We at the Embassy found that the reaction at Chungking on
                        the war situation followed the trend of the fortunes of the United Nations;
                        when those fortunes are low we observe discouragement among the Chinese and
                        renewed rumors of possible peace negotiations. This was not the first report
                        or rumor that we had had from the Russians; I had no reason to believe that
                        their sources were particularly good or accurate; and I did not recall any
                        particular Russian report which had been proven correct. However, I did not
                        dismiss the report on that ground. We at the Embassy have been keeping our
                        ear to the ground for some weeks, talking with Chinese officials and others
                        who are inclined to talk frankly, and we had yet <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110"
                            facs="0120"/>to discover anyone who believed that peace negotiations or
                        discussions of any kind were going on with the Chinese—certainly not with
                        the Generalissimo and those in authority. Practically everyone had
                        maintained that with or without aid of the United States and other nations,
                        China would continue to resist the Japanese in China. I stated that I had
                        not had occasion to see the Generalissimo for several weeks—since T. V.
                        Soong has become Foreign Minister and remains at Washington most of the
                        conversations between China and the United States have apparently been
                        through Soong at Washington and I was not informed of them—but on several
                        occasions in the past when there have been rumors of peace proposals I have
                        mentioned the rumors to the Generalissimo and he has been most emphatic in
                        his statement that no peace proposals had been received nor would any be
                        entertained. I felt confident that, notwithstanding the existing rumors and
                        such reports as that from the Russian Military Attaché, the Generalissimo
                        and those in authority in the Government could not afford to entertain peace
                        terms from the Japanese; certainly not peace terms which would leave the
                        Japanese in substantial control of the country. I asked Stilwell what he
                        thought of the report.</p>
                    <p>He replied that he was inclined to share my view that the Generalissimo could
                        not and would not entertain peace proposals from Japan, on the grounds (1)
                        that the Chinese have their eyes on the rich plum of half a billion dollars
                        U. S. currency held out to them, and (2) that the Generalissimo and those
                        around him had nothing to gain and everything to lose by making peace with
                        Japan; but on the other side of the picture there are (1) the recent “three
                        demands” by the Generalissimo with the suggestion of peace with Japan as the
                        alternative, and (2) the manner in which the Generalissimo and China have
                        been built up by propaganda in the United States to a point where it might
                        be possible for the Generalissimo to make a peace with Japan and yet get by
                        with the people of the United States by saying that China has been isolated,
                        can no longer receive outside aid, and perforce has had temporarily to make
                        a peace with Japan, a peace which will be set aside as soon as China can
                        regather strength.</p>
                    <p>I remarked that I had no information of the “three demands” made by the
                        Generalissimo to which General Stilwell referred; I had been told nothing of
                        them. I asked what they were; and I had to repeat my inquiry several times
                        in the course of the conversation that followed before he finally told me
                        that the Generalissimo demanded (1) three American divisions in India, with
                        the necessary auxiliary troops, (2) 500 combat airplanes, which meant 1,000
                        since there must be about the same number in reserve, and (3) 5,000 tons of
                        supplies by air transport monthly. I asked why Chiang wanted three divisions
                        in India; Stilwell replied that of course Chiang would like to have <pb
                            n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0121"/>them in China, but India is
                        mentioned as the base for a drive to retake Burma to re-open the route of
                        supply to China. Stilwell said that the Generalissimo is sticking to these
                        demands; he will not listen to reason; he will not accept figures showing
                        that, for example, it is not possible to supply and service 500 combat
                        planes in China (Stilwell mentioned that the supplies of gas and bombs in
                        the country would only service the present small air force we have sent in
                        for six months in carrying out the limited missions assigned to them); he
                        will wave aside information showing that it would be necessary to build five
                        new air fields near Kunming to service the transport planes necessary to
                        bring in 5,000 tons a month—and 5,000 tons represented about what it would
                        take to supply 500 combat planes.</p>
                    <p>By further questioning I developed more of the conversation which had taken
                        place between the Generalissimo and Stilwell (with Madame Chiang present).
                        He said that the Generalissimo insisted upon the aid indicated (the three
                        demands; but he admitted there were also “some other things” he wanted) or
                        he would have “to make other arrangements”. Stilwell said that he inquired
                        whether he understood correctly the statement that the Generalissimo would
                        “have to make other arrangements” and this had been put back to the
                        Generalissimo in Chinese by Madame Chiang and he had confirmed the
                        statement.</p>
                    <p>I commented to Stilwell that the report as it had reached me through Colonel
                        Mayer, my Military Attaché, was to the effect that the Generalissimo had
                        been greatly irritated at information conveyed by Stilwell that certain
                        American air support had been diverted to the Middle East and had said to
                        Stilwell that he wished to know whether Washington still considered the
                        China theater worthy of aid—this, in order that he might plan for the
                        future—and that it was Madame Chiang who had made the aside in English that
                        this implied peace with Japan. I had not been told of the Generalissimo’s
                        three demands. When Colonel Mayer reported to me on Saturday, June 27, the
                        information he had received from Stilwell regarding the conversation with
                        the Generalissimo, I had considered it desirable to see Stilwell and had
                        come over for that purpose on Sunday, June 28; and I had not then learned
                        anything from Stilwell about any three demands or any further conversation
                        with the Generalissimo.</p>
                    <p>I asked Stilwell when the three demands had been made. He said he was
                        confused as to dates and could not say without referring to his notes. (I
                        had to leave it at that, with Stilwell intimating that Colonel Mayer had not
                        conveyed to me in full the conversation he (Stilwell) had given to Mayer. At
                        that time Stilwell was still ill and I doubt whether he has a very clear
                        recollection of what he did tell Mayer.)</p>
                    <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0122"/>
                    <p>I then asked Stilwell whether he had reported his conversations with the
                        Generalissimo to Washington; he said he had. I asked whether there had been
                        an answer; he said no, except that on some points there had been profuse
                        apologies but the main issue had not been met.</p>
                    <p>Referring to Stilwell’s two points—Chiang’s demands and the possibility that
                        Chiang might be able to make a peace with Japan and get by with it in the
                        United States, I expressed my views substantially as follows:</p>
                    <p>I agreed that it is unfortunate that Chiang and the Chinese have been “built
                        up” in the United States to a point where Americans have been made to
                        believe that China has been “fighting” the Japanese for five years, and that
                        the Generalissimo, a great leader, has been directing the energetic
                        resistance of China to Japan and is a world hero. Looking the cold facts in
                        the face one could only dismiss this as “rot”. China’s “prowess” has been
                        overplayed; and we have said so to Washington.</p>
                    <p>As to Chiang’s demands, Madame Chiang’s aside, and the Generalissimo’s
                        statement that he would “have to make other plans”—whatever that implied—it
                        is my firm conviction that this is a bluff; and the type of bluff that
                        Madame Chiang was capable of concocting and selling to the Generalissimo.
                        This “either or else” attitude could not, in my opinion, be accepted. (I had
                        in mind in this connection a report which has circulated in Chungking to the
                        effect that Stalin<note n="70" xml:id="d104fn4">Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin,
                            Chairman of the Council of Commissars (Premier) of the Soviet
                            Union.</note> some months ago told Washington that either the U. S. must
                        come through with all-out aid to Russia “or else” Russia would make a
                        separate peace with Germany.) I commented that even the Communist leaders
                        here seem to know that Chiang is putting up a bluff, for they tell us that
                        it is a bluff and we should “call” it. I recalled that Dr. T. F. Tsiang
                        (Tsiang Ting-fu) was the Government spokesman who had first sounded the note
                        that Japan proposes to undertake a major offensive in China and China must
                        have help—planes, and more planes, and more planes. I said that in a recent
                        conversation I had with Dr. Tsiang, whom I found to be more frank and
                        plain-spoken than most Chinese officials, I had asked him point blank
                        whether there was any discussion or indication of any kind in the Government
                        of possible peace with Japan and he had given me an immediate and positive
                        “no” in reply. And everyone else with whom any of us has talked takes the
                        same line—there is no thought of peace with Japan. Those who are outspoken
                        describe the recent Chinese cry for planes and more planes and more planes
                        as pure bluff; China sees other nations being supplied and wants her share.
                        As to Madame Chiang’s <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0123"/>remark, I had
                        commented to Washington that I considered it as representing her impatient
                        and captious attitude and I did not believe that General Chiang, or in fact
                        Madame herself, had any thought of possible peace with Japan.</p>
                    <p>I said that I did feel, however, that a reasonable measure of air support and
                        munitions should be given to China; that it should be given without default;
                        and that whatever the demands from other theaters, I believed this aid
                        should come to China without fail and without unnecessary delay.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion—and we have had this opinion consistently from the beginning of
                        my tenure as Ambassador—China is only a minor asset to us; she might however
                        become a major liability. As an asset, China has contained a substantial
                        Japanese force in China that might otherwise have been used in some other
                        theater against the United Nations. There was also the possibility that we
                        could use the air fields in eastern China as a base for an air offensive
                        against Japan but now those fields are lost and there appears to be little
                        chance of their being recovered and used; so that China is less of an asset
                        than ever before. But it is desirable that China continue to be aligned on
                        the side of the United Nations—if only to continue to contain a substantial
                        Japanese force now stalemated in China. And having in mind the demand for
                        three divisions of American troops in India to attack Burma, those at
                        Washington concerned with high strategy might find it desirable to undertake
                        a thrust at Burma from India at the same time that MacArthur starts “rolling
                        them up” from Australia and our Navy may perhaps attack the Japanese island
                        strongholds in the South Pacific—unless of course Siberia comes into the
                        picture and the United Nations strategy contemplates getting at Japan
                        through Siberia.</p>
                    <p>I have also felt that there is a real possibility—but I have not been willing
                        to call it a probability—that Japan may hesitate to attack Russia in
                        Siberia, or India, or Australia, but, instead, concentrate on China, in
                        which case China must be bolstered so far as possible toward offering
                        effective “resistance”. Therefore it has seemed to me that the United
                        Nations should not hesitate longer in sending into China all the air force
                        that China can sustain and service—and that does not seem to be a very large
                        force—together with a continuing supply of materials for small arms
                        ammunition; so that China can at least have means and assistance available
                        in attempting continued resistance—and effective resistance, I hoped—against
                        Japan.</p>
                    <p>Stilwell mentioned that he fears a Japanese attack on Yunnan from Indo-China.
                        I commented that we have heard before of such possibilities; and now we also
                        have the possibility of such an attack synchronized with an attack from
                        Burma; but personally, I believe <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0124"
                        />that if Japanese forces become heavily engaged on other substantial and
                        major fronts, additional pressure on China will not be applied. On the other
                        hand, if Japan does not become involved in Siberia, or Alaska, or India, or
                        Australia, then we can expect her to throw her weight against China. These
                        are considerations which should be weighed in Washington. A decision should
                        be reached as to what can be supplied to and used in China—and it is
                        important that we consider not what China wants but what China can use—and
                        Chiang should then be told that he will be given that support. If he
                        persists in demanding more and threatens peace with Japan, I am of the
                        opinion that he should be told, with authority of Washington, that when he
                        undertakes to negotiate a peace with Japan the American military and
                        diplomatic missions will immediately be withdrawn without further ado from
                        China, and that finishes all American assistance to China—now and for the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>The conversation then turned to Currie. (I had sent Stilwell word that Currie
                        was coming out; he had replied with the information that he already had had
                        word from Washington to that effect.) He asked what authority Currie has. I
                        replied that all I knew about Currie’s visit was contained in my message
                        from the Secretary of State<note n="71" xml:id="d104fn5">Telegram No. 591,
                            July 3, 9 p.m., <ref target="#pg_94">p. 94</ref>.</note> which I drew
                        from my files and showed him. He said, in reply to a question, that the
                        Chinese had not mentioned the Currie visit. I stated that it had not been
                        mentioned to me from any Chinese source, but that I knew from an American
                        source that the fact of Currie’s expected visit was known in Chungking and
                        had come to him on a date which I identified as before the receipt of the
                        message by me from Washington.</p>
                    <p>Stilwell said that Currie was meeting General Gruber<note n="72"
                            xml:id="d104fn6">Brig. Gen. William B. Gruber, of General Stilwell’s
                            staff.</note> (whom Stilwell is sending to Washington) today, in Accra,
                        Africa. Stilwell wanted to know whether we would see Currie before he saw
                        Chiang; would he confer with me, would he confer with Stilwell. I said that
                        I did not know; nor did I know Currie’s wishes; but I was sending an
                        invitation to Currie (to be taken to New Delhi by Colonel Mayer) to stay at
                        the Embassy. I doubted whether he would do so; but I had made the offer and
                        had told Currie that we stand prepared to give him any assistance desired;
                        further, I knew not! Stilwell seemed to feel that Currie should confer with
                        him and with me before seeing the Chinese. I agreed that this seemed to me
                        desirable, but I did not know what Currie would do nor did I know what his
                        instructions might be.</p>

                    <p>General Yang Chieh has been President of the Military Academy at Nanking and
                        Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union during the early part of the
                        Sino-Japanese conflict. He is now in retirement. I had been told that
                        several months ago that he had written an article, which had received some
                        publicity, advocating the concentration of United Nations’ strength on the
                        defeat of Germany. Apparently the President had been informed of this
                        article, for T. V. Soong was said to have reported to the Generalissimo that
                        the President had in conversation with him commented favorably on General
                        Yang’s point of view. Thereupon the Generalissimo, according to the report
                        which I heard, ordered General Yang to desist from writing in that vein, or
                        at least to write under an assumed name.</p>
                    <p>General Yang was the first Chinese with whom I talked in Chungking who did
                        not anticipate an imminent Japanese attack on Siberia in the near future. He
                        believed that the Japanese had more to gain by delaying military action
                        against Siberia. A Japanese attack against India he considered to be more
                        likely. The profits to be gained would be more immediate and more
                        remunerative.</p>
                    <p>The experiences of General Yang in connection with the obtention of Russian
                        aid for China in the early phases of the Sino-Japanese hostilities were
                        illuminating and significant in connection with our own program of
                        lend-lease aid to China. He said that the day after his arrival in Moscow he
                        stated China’s needs to the Soviet military authorities. In a matter of two
                        or three days the main outlines of what form this aid was to take had been
                        decided upon. Prices were not mentioned in the initial negotiations and when
                        they were, they were lower than those asked by American and British
                        commercial organizations. The supplies promptly began to move and, as we
                        know, arrived during the early phase of the war at Haiphong, Hong Kong and
                        Lanchow by the thousands of tons.</p>
                    <p>But then came the Russian disillusionment. They discovered that the aircraft
                        were misused and cracked-up by inexperienced personnel and that the other
                        material seemed scarcely ever to find its way into combat against the
                        Japanese. It disappeared and no accounting was given. The Russians
                        reproached him for misrepresentation and he found himself in a most
                        uncomfortable position.</p>
                    <p>We Americans must be on guard against a repetition of the Russian experience,
                        General Yang warned. We must take steps to insure <pb n="116"
                            xml:id="pg_116" facs="0126"/>that the material which we supply China is
                        used for the purpose for which it is given. If this is not done, lend-lease
                        supplies will be hoarded by the Chinese Government (for civil warfare,
                        maintaining the dominance of the regime now in power and for increasing
                        China’s military strength against the day when it can be used as a counter
                        at the peace table?) “We Chinese have thick skins,” General Yang stated,
                        “and you have been too polite with us.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chang Pai-chun, leader of the Third Party, was present during the
                        interview and signified agreement with General Yang.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose for the
                        Department’s information a memorandum of conversation with Dr. Henry Chang,
                        Director of the American Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Dr.
                        Chang has only recently returned to China after more than a decade abroad in
                        the diplomatic service. His last post was Minister to Chile. Although Dr.
                        Chang is not party to the councils of the great on high policy, he is an
                        official of intelligence and his observations, coming from a Chinese who is
                        seeing his country anew after many years, are worthy of note as representing
                        in some degree the viewpoint of the strata of Chinese officialdom in which
                        he finds himself.</p>

                        <p>This morning I called on Dr. Henry Chang, Director of the American
                            Department of the Foreign Office. After we had finished with the
                            immediate business of my call (American radio stations in Chungking),
                            the conversation turned to the general situation in China in relation to
                            the war effort.</p>
                        <p>I wanted to get from Dr. Chang (and told him so) his impressions, as a
                            Chinese back in China after many years’ absence, of the China scene in
                            relation to the general war effort.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Chang said that the circumstance or condition which had impressed him
                            most upon his return was the fortitude with which the <pb n="117"
                                xml:id="pg_117" facs="0127"/>Chinese people were carrying on with
                            the war and the confidence with which they looked forward to ultimate
                            victory. He said that, from his own observations and from information
                            coming to him, he reached the conclusion that this fortitude and this
                            confidence were general throughout China, among the people in the
                            capital and in the provinces and among all classes. There was war
                            weariness, of course, but this did not seem to modify the feeling that
                            resistance must be continued until the Japanese were driven from the
                            country. Much hope had been placed upon the entrance of America and
                            England into the war in the Pacific and the initial reverses had, quite
                            naturally, made for disappointment. It was a fact that the economic and
                            the military situation in China had actually worsened as a result of the
                            general war in the Pacific but that morale had not. He said that Chinese
                            generally had a sincere expectation that the United Nations would win
                            the war.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Chang commented that Chinese with whom he was in contact felt that
                            China was not being given sufficient aid. He pointed to production
                            reports from the United States and said that the Chinese felt that the
                            China theater of the war merited greater support. He referred to talk of
                            a “second front” and said that China might be considered the “second
                            front”. I mentioned transportation difficulties He said that he had in
                            mind principally air support and the materials that would be required to
                            support an American air force in China. Materials for arsenals were also
                            mentioned. He expressed the opinion that some definite amount of
                            support, which took into consideration transportation facilities, should
                            be decided upon and that then definite provision should be made for
                            getting that support to China.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Chang said that he had never heard the matter of assistance from
                            America mentioned as essential to the continuance of Chinese resistance.
                            China needed assistance but China would continue to fight whether she
                            received assistance or not. He dismissed as baseless rumor any talk of
                            China’s entertaining peace proposals from Japan.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Chang thought, as many other Chinese officials, that the Japanese
                            were planning an attack on Siberia but were delaying action in the hope
                            that Russian reverses in Europe would soon present a more favorable
                            opportunity for their offensive. He considered the Japanese campaigns in
                            Chekiang and Kiangsu as offensives with a limited and defensive
                            objective. He did not anticipate any major Japanese offensive against
                            China at this time and did not consider as realistic prognostications
                            that the Japanese had plans for establishing rail connections between
                            Korea and French Indo-China through eastern China.</p>

                    <p>867. In the Chekiang area Japanese troops evacuated Wenchow soon after
                        occupying it on July 11 and Chinese troops reoccupied the city on July 17
                        but the next day Japanese troops from naval vessels retook the port and held
                        it. Chinese claim that they are still holding Juian, south of Wenchow, which
                        they retook on July 17.</p>
                    <p>In Kiangsi the Japanese have withdrawn from a number of points indicating
                        that they do not intend to hold the Chekiang-Kiangsi railway. The Chinese
                        have reoccupied Hengfeng and Tyang on the railway and they expect the
                        Japanese to give up Shangjao and possibly Chuchow, pointing out that the
                        Japanese are engaged in systematic plundering of towns and extortion of
                        money, apparently preliminary to withdrawal. The Chinese state however that
                        even should they be able to reoccupy the strategic airfields in Chekiang and
                        Kiangsi it would not be difficult for the Japanese to prevent their
                        reconstruction.</p>
                    <p>There have been small scale and seemingly insignificant clashes between
                        Chinese and Japanese troops in Southern Honan near Sinyang, in Southern
                        Shansi and in Suiyuan south of Paotou. The Chinese claim successes in these
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>An American naval observer recently returned from Chekiang states that the
                        Chinese commander at Lishui had well equipped troops and was anxious to
                        fight but that under orders from Chungking he was obliged for political
                        reasons to withdraw without fighting. The Embassy had received no report of
                        unconfirmed reports that the Chinese commanders in the Chekiang area were
                        advised from Chungking not to make a determined stand against the
                        Japanese.</p>
                    <p>There have been no recent political or economic developments of note.
                        Lowering of the United States dollar-Chinese <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi>
                        rate to five cents has had no appreciable effect on the financial situation.
                        Sale of United States dollar certificates and bonds continues
                        insignificant.</p>
                    <p>Embassy is inclined to question statement in message to Treasury (Embassy’s
                        841, July 15)<note n="74" xml:id="d107fn74">

                        that improvements in terms and methods of issue would have made no
                        appreciable difference. Embassy continues to believe that trust fund
                        arraignment and trustworthy assurance of free use of dollar credit upon
                        redemption, even at this late date, would have encouraging effects upon
                        sales.</p>
                    <p>The government spokesman, announcing Currie’s arrival, stated that his second
                        visit “will undoubtedly be even more fruitful than his first visit”. Asked
                        whether more planes were needed in addition to those of the present United
                        States Army Air Force, he replied “Of <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119"
                            facs="0129"/>course—more.” Questioned regarding other material needed,
                        he said, “The list is very long.”</p>
                    <p>In general, the Embassy does not perceive anything in the present situation
                        to cause it to alter its view that the Chinese will, in their own fashion,
                        maintain the policy of resistance and continue to weather the storm.</p>

                        to the Chinese army and people broadcast July 7, 1942 by Generalissimo
                        Chiang Kai-shek. He began this message by recalling that China on that date
                        had for five years been engaged in armed resistance and that during the past
                        year there had occurred developments which would determine the final outcome
                        of the war.</p>
                    <p>China, the Generalissimo stated, is charged with the duty of operating as the
                        main fighting force on the Asiatic continent. The United States, he
                        continued, has a similar duty to deal in the Pacific with Japan, which he
                        referred to as our first and most threatening enemy. He warned against
                        giving credence to rumors that Allied strategy and policy relegate the
                        Pacific War to a secondary position or that Japan will be allowed to operate
                        freely for the time being.</p>
                    <p>Chiang Kai-shek is further quoted as stating that reverses inflicted on Japan
                        at Midway Island, in the Coral Sea and at Dutch Harbor as well as other
                        defeats which will follow may be expected to make Japan’s position
                        untenable. He concluded, “Irrespective of age or sex we must each contribute
                        to the all-important task which, when completed, will bring victory and
                        permanent security to a free world.”</p>

                    <p>Currie is here. I have seen him briefly once or twice, but do not know that
                        he is making much progress. He promises to tell me all before he leaves; but
                        so far I have had only a most sketchy account of his conversations and he
                        does not appear to be very cheerful.</p>
                    <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>The best military advice that I can get indicates that, come September, we
                        are likely to see activity in the China theater in the form of a Japanese
                        threat against Yunnan. Undoubtedly from Burma; but perhaps also from
                        Indochina and Thailand, and perhaps also from Canton through Kwangsi. “They
                        say” that China is wide open in the Yunnan area. When it is pointed out that
                        our civilian sources of information indicate the presence of a substantial
                        Chinese force disposed to face a threat from Burma, the reply then is that
                        it is not properly disposed for the best results and that there is nothing
                        to prevent a thrust from Indochina or Canton. On the latter situations, I
                        must confess that we have no information to suggest that China is prepared
                        to resist—and it takes months to move troops on foot; that is all that can
                        be done now that gasoline stocks are running out. On the other hand, there
                        is as yet no information to confirm that the Japanese are making
                        concentrations in Indochina for a push up that difficult terrain into
                        Yunnan. And even in the Burma border area, difficult terrain and few roads
                        should make it possible for a comparatively small force of Chinese, properly
                        equipped and well led, to stop the Japanese. A reasonable increase in our
                        air support would also assist. It was the AVG which stopped the Japanese
                        rapid penetration into Yunnan immediately following the Chinese debacle in
                        Burma.</p>
                    <p>I am not a military man, and perhaps I should not be venturing opinions and
                        comments on what are actually military matters, but I find such divergence
                        of opinion amongst the military men that it has just seemed that as an
                        ordinary civilian the best I can do is to gather what “facts” may be
                        available and form my own conclusions.</p>
                    <p>Despite all rumors, I do not believe that Chiang can afford to consider peace
                        with the Japanese, and I am convinced that he will not do so. But he has his
                        head in the clouds so much these days that there is always the possibility
                        that in looking over wider fields he may miss the dangers close at home.
                        And, of course, if anything happens, he will gladly blame everything on the
                        failure to receive American aid. The danger spots in my opinion will be
                        found amongst his generals on the periphery—Yen in Shansi, Lung Yun in
                        Yunnan, and Yu Han-mo in the Canton area. Any one of these might make a
                        deal, or break; and if the Japanese once get this opportunity to move in
                        rapidly, Chungking might readily fall. We speculate here at times whether
                        the autumn may not find us all “treking” northwest into Shensi or <pb
                            n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0131"/>Kansu, for we believe that if the
                        government has to flee from Chungking the G-mo<note n="76" xml:id="d109fn76"
                            >Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.</note> will seek to put himself with his
                        so-called best army under Hu Tsung-nan, now quarantining the Communists in
                        Shensi-Shansi.</p>
                    <p>Say what they will in their “war communiqués” and official statements of
                        official and military spokesmen, China has done very little fighting since
                        the war broke generally in the Pacific. They “resisted” successfully at
                        Changsha, but did not follow through and avail themselves of the opportunity
                        to inflict a severe defeat on the Japanese. They did send forces into Burma,
                        but they gave a poor account of themselves (as did the British). Several
                        units were exceptionally good; but others were poor, and when the latter
                        broke and fled there came the debacle. Many of us here have wondered why
                        Stilwell did not fly out when he had the opportunity and take up a directing
                        position in the rear instead of mooching through the jungle—not with any
                        body of troops but with refugees, Burmese nurses, etc. But perhaps he knew
                        best. He now has some idea of 3 American divisions to “force” the British to
                        undertake an expedition to retake Burma with American help and to induce
                        China also to come in. I am told that this proposal is not receiving much
                        support at home. That is a matter of high strategy. Stilwell would want
                        supreme command; and I do not believe the British would give it to him. And
                        I wonder how the Chinese feel. Of course a movement to retake Burma and
                        penetrate into Thailand and French Indochina—a movement timed with a
                        movement by Mac Arthur to “roll them up from Australia” (what a tremendous
                        task), and a movement by our Navy to strike at the outlying Japanese island
                        bases in the south Pacific, might be good strategy. But I gather that the
                        British are determined to “re-take Burma” in their own time and their own
                        way and they give little evidence of being interested in China.</p>
                    <p>As a layman trying to be rational and realistic, I can see only a reasonable
                        distance ahead. An American military expedition to retake Burma means ships
                        and supplies. Can we spare them; or do we actually have them? Until we do,
                        we should in my opinion make a careful survey of the China situation and
                        determine what aid we can send to China—not what China “wants” but what we
                        decide we can give and what she can use effectively. Then give it—no
                        diverting this or that or the other thing. China has facilities and reserves
                        to support a small air force for 6 months to a year—perhaps not more than 50
                        medium bombers and 100 pursuits or fighters. Give her that—and support it
                        with replacements, spare parts and personnel. And as a matter of fact,
                        unless Japan ceases her more grandiose expansion expeditions and
                        concentrates on China, I soberly believe that small <pb n="122"
                            xml:id="pg_122" facs="0132"/>air force—under Chennault, who knows his
                        business—would accomplish wonders. But of course if Japan is not to
                        penetrate toward India, or Australia, or Siberia, or Alaska, or the Hawaiian
                        Islands, then Tokyo may determine to use full force to liquidate the China
                        Incident. If that is done, China will undoubtedly continue the policy of
                        resistance as long as possible—but China would undoubtedly collapse in the
                        face of a strong Japanese effort. Japan has not made that effort in the
                        past. Japan has been conserving her strength for the world war which has now
                        come. China has been a training ground for troops and air force; but since
                        the early years of the Sino-Japanese war, Japan has not made an effort in
                        strength to liquidate the China Incident. Unless Japan is stopped before she
                        turns in full force to that task, China must succumb when the full weight of
                        Japanese pressure is put into this country.</p>
                    <p>We have had an unusually hot and trying summer this year. No actual air
                        raids—so far, but there are still 3 months ahead. But the heat has been
                        terrific and we are all feeling it. Last year I was fresh enough to remain
                        down on the south bank and attend the chancery daily, and at night to try to
                        sleep in our attic rooms under the hot roof. But we could not hold out this
                        year and I am staying most of the time in an emergency cottage in the hills
                        where the telegrams and despatches come up to me regularly to be worked on
                        and sent down again. I alternate officers and clerks here—to give them a bit
                        of clean air and an occasional light breeze. John Carter [Vincent] comes up
                        every evening—or most every evening. He, too, feels it this summer and even
                        when I remained down on the south bank he sought refuge up here for the
                        nights and a better chance of sleep. I am fairly near the G-mo, Kung<note

                        know what is going on, I have little occasion to see either the G-mo or
                        Kung. I am going over to the G-mo’s tonight for dinner. Vincent goes to

                        bridge at that, I understand). McHugh also goes for bridge from time to

                        not have his old track in petticoat politics; and as a matter of fact he has
                        repeatedly been told that it is known that he has made unfavorable or
                        critical reports to Washington. I have a feeling that the same feeling is

                    <p>Mr. Currie opened the conversation with a question regarding the course of
                        hostilities in southwestern Russia. The Ambassador discussed the situation
                        in this theater in some detail and admitted that it was very serious.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Currie then inquired whether in the opinion of the Ambassador the Chinese
                        could be counted upon to continue resistance despite the reverses which the
                        United Nations are currently suffering and continued Japanese pressure on
                        China. The Ambassador replied in the affirmative and the Military Attaché
                        nodded in agreement.</p>
                    <p>The next question dealt with a possible Chinese-British-American attempt to
                        re-take Burma. In the event of such an effort, Mr. Currie asked, did the
                        Ambassador think that there would be a tendency on the part of the Chinese
                        to hold back and let the British carry the brunt of the fighting? The
                        Ambassador indicated that he thought the Chinese would fight (it was not
                        clear, however, that the Ambassador fully understood the question). The
                        Military Attaché, on the other hand, appeared to understand the question as
                        phrased in English and as Mr. Currie spoke shook his head, seeming to
                        signify that he had misgivings over the likelihood of the Chinese being
                        willing to carry their share of the load.</p>
                    <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0134"/>
                    <p>Out of this discussion there arose the question of unified command. The
                        Military Attaché was emphatic in the need for centralized authority in any
                        joint campaign.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Currie asked the Military Attaché if he thought that a foreign military
                        officer could successfully command Chinese troops. The Military Attaché
                        replied with confidence that such an arrangement would not work. A system of
                        advisers, however, could serve a useful purpose. But such a system calls for
                        advisers in all of the various units, from armies and divisions on down. The
                        ranking adviser must have at his disposal his own channel of information
                        from and advice to the smaller units. Asked whether the Chinese were willing
                        to accept advice, the Military Attaché shrugged his shoulders and said that
                        yes they would, usually.</p>
                    <p>The Military Attaché stated, when asked by Mr. Currie about exchange of
                        information between the Russian and American military officers in Chungking,
                        that there was no close cooperation and that the American officers were not
                        inclined to talk frankly.</p>

                    <p>913. Following significant statement by government spokesman on August 4 is
                        quoted in full for Department’s information.</p>
                    <p>“Exactly one month has elapsed since the United States Army Air Forces went
                        into action against the Japanese in the China theater. Its defensive and
                        offensive activities during the first 3 weeks disturbed the enemy so much
                        that he decided during the past week to challenge the American Air Force
                        over Hengyang. This challenge was obviously no feeble attempt, considering
                        both the number and quality of the fighting craft the enemy amassed for this
                        onslaught. But again the enemy was put to rout after suffering heavy
                        losses.</p>
                    <p>It is the general conviction of the Chinese people that with an increasing
                        American Air Force, the very nature of the war in the China theater will
                        undergo a radical change. For before the American Air Forces appeared on the
                        horizon, the Japanese could do great damage to us even with a small air
                        force. Invariably her tactics was to concentrate that small air force for
                        attacking a particular front or a particular city, since she had little to
                        worry about her own air fields and strongholds in her occupied areas. Now
                        the situation is changing. The American planes having come into action in
                        the China theater, Japan is getting a headache in trying to solve the <pb
                            n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0135"/>hitherto non-existent problem of
                        protecting her air fields and strongholds, which are widely scattered and
                        great in number. She is obliged to throw into the field many more men and
                        machines if she wants to feel reasonably safe.</p>
                    <p>Thus the entry of the American Air Force into the China theater produces
                        three results, all of which are important. First, Japan’s earlier tactics of
                        menacing China with an unchallenged small air force is no longer feasible.
                        Second, the Chinese army will be enabled to achieve better results in
                        immobilizing an increasing number of Japanese troops, because with air
                        support it will be able to engage the latter on any and practically every
                        front. Third, the American Air Force will perform its own work of
                        immobilizing constantly an important portion of the Japanese Air Force in
                        China.”</p>

                        but I was given no confidence by Currie as to his conversations with
                        Stilwell and the Generalissimo. I made telegraphic facilities available to
                        him without questioning his messages.</p>

                    <p>I have understood that Stilwell favors an American-British-Chinese expedition
                        under American High Command to retake Burma in order to reopen Burma Road
                        and to supply and energize China theater for air attacks on Japan proper and
                        on Jap communications through Formosan channel; also to strike at Indo-China
                        and Thailand. He has no more than mentioned the subject to me very casually
                        but I learned from others that he was considering making a recommendation to
                        train several Chinese divisions in India where they could be given full
                        equipment from Lend-Lease supplies now there, including field pieces and
                        other relatively heavy arms which cannot be moved into China at this time
                        for lack of transport. There are already several thousand Chinese troops in
                        India who came from Burma. The balance of any Chinese force would have to be
                        sent to India from China by car. I do not know how far, if at all, the
                        matter was discussed with Generalissimo. I have been told that Stilwell went

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose copy of a
                            despatch<note n="86" xml:id="d115fn86">Not printed.</note> from Second
                        Secretary of Embassy John Davies, Jr., attached to the American Military
                        Mission, submitting copy of a memorandum prepared by him for Lieutenant
                        General Joseph W. Stilwell appraising the China-Burma-India situation; an
                        appraisal which I assume was desired by General Stilwell in connection with
                        what I understand to be his recommendation, or contemplated recommendation,
                        for a joint American-British-Chinese expedition to retake Burma, strike at
                        the Japanese in <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0137"/>French Indo-China
                        and Thailand, and reopen the Burma Road to supply and energize the China
                        theater for air attacks on Japan proper and on Japanese lines of
                        communication and supply to the south.</p>
                    <p>General Stilwell has casually mentioned, but not discussed his plans with me.
                        I am told, however, that his proposals would contemplate the training and
                        equipment in India—where American lend-lease materiel and equipment intended
                        for China are now available but cannot be moved into China for lack of
                        sufficient air transport—of several Chinese divisions which, with a number
                        of British divisions, and perhaps three American divisions, as an American
                        “token” force, with appropriate air and other support, should constitute an
                        expeditionary force under American high command, to retake Burma. There are
                        already several thousand Chinese troops in India or Assam, being part of the
                        Chinese force that escaped from Burma.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Davies’ memorandum suggests that the British have no intention of
                        attempting to retake Burma in the foreseeable future for the same reason
                        displayed in the lack of interest in an aggressive defense of Burma, that
                        is, the conviction that no Asiatic possession is worth any appreciable
                        diversion of strength from the British Isles; that the war will be won in
                        Europe; and that at the peace conference lost possessions will revert to
                        Britain with clear title. The memorandum asserts—with what authority, I do
                        not know—that there are adequate British forces in India for an expedition
                        to retake Burma. The memorandum fails to consider the situation in the
                        Middle East as it threatens the security of India, nor does it consider the
                        internal situation in India and its relation to any decision to send British
                        troops—principally Indians—on an expedition to Burma. It seems to me that
                        another important factor in any Burma campaign would be the question of the
                        proposed future status of Burma, the decision on which might affect the
                        attitude of the Burmese toward the proposed expedition into their
                        country.</p>
                    <p>In examining the China situation, Mr. Davies asserts that it is China’s
                        policy to conserve rather than to expend Chinese military strength, China’s
                        confidence being placed in American sea and air power—and perhaps Russian
                        military and air strength—to defeat the Japanese. Mr. Davies suggests,
                        however, that China might be persuaded to join in a second Burma campaign;
                        an opinion in which I concur, although it is known that at the time that
                        Generalissimo Chiang ordered the participation of Chinese forces in the
                        defense of Burma there were those among his military advisers who strongly
                        urged against the sending of more than a “token” force to the Burma
                        front.</p>
                    <p>The proposed Stilwell expedition against Burma, however—if it has actually
                        been recommended; a point on which I have no positive information—would, <pb
                            n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0138"/>in my opinion, require substantial
                        naval and air support, and, it seems to me, should be undertaken only as a
                        carefully synchronized measure in a grand strategy for a general offensive
                        against Japan—from Australia, by sea against Japan’s outlying naval and air
                        bases in the Pacific, by overwhelming naval force against Japan proper, and
                        by aerial attack from Siberian or any other available bases.</p>
                    <p>Major operations against Japan on such a scale could not likely be undertaken
                        until the fortunes of the United Nations in the European theater permit of
                        the necessary diversion of man power, aerial force, naval strength, and
                        shipping, materiel and supplies in sufficient volume to the Pacific
                        area.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, as to the China front, earnest consideration should be given to
                        extending such practical, substantial aid to China as may be possible to
                        permit China to continue to maintain resistance to Japan and to contain the
                        Japanese force now in this country. It has been demonstrated that even
                        limited American air support—that is, planes and American personnel—can be
                        of vital and substantial assistance to China in aid to the Chinese ground
                        forces, in attacking Japanese air and other bases and shipping and lines of
                        supply and communication, and in sustaining and improving Chinese morale. I
                        am of the opinion that the present very limited air support—more restricted
                        than intended due to the diversion of planes and personnel to the Middle
                        East—should be increased to the point possible with existing Chinese air
                        bases, reserve supplies of aviation gasoline, bombs, et cetera (and their
                        replenishment by reasonable air transport facilities). The American air
                        force in China, under the command of Brigadier General Claire Chennault, who
                        formerly headed the American Volunteer Group of the Chinese Air Force, has
                        demonstrated what can be done with so little under the conditions existing
                        in this theater of the war by an efficient and experienced officer who has
                        made long observation of Japanese aerial tactics and has shown courage,
                        resource and sound judgment in actual combat operations.</p>
                    <p>The American Army Air Force in China should be increased and maintained and
                        supported, within the limits of the available facilities in China, as the
                        one real and substantial contribution that we can make to China at the
                        present stage of the war. A substantial air transport supply service will be
                        required to maintain this force alone. This service should be provided and
                        extended as rapidly as possible to permit of regular supplies of essential
                        raw materials for the continued necessary operation of China’s small arms
                        arsenals and ammunition factories.</p>

                                <item>It may be possible to induce the Chinese High Command to

                                    result in the supplies being hoarded and not in their use

                                    intention of attempting to retake Burma in the foreseeable
                                    future. That reason would seem to be a British conviction that

                                    strength from the British Isles; that the war will be won in

                                    whereas if those possessions are reoccupied with Chinese and

                                    of their side of the bargain, the galvanization of the British
                                    into a counter-offensive against Burma can probably be
                                    accomplished only by pressure from the highest American source
                                    on London together with the commitment of a token American force
                                    to the reconquest of Burma, which commitment may be expected to
                                    force British parallel action. There are enough British Empire

                                    spirit. If an attempt is to be made to retake Burma and open a
                                    second front, supreme command must be in American hands, and it
                                    must be made effective.</item>

                                <item>The principal factor limiting American action, present and
                                    potential, in China, Burma and India is a logistic one. Always
                                    when planning there must be kept in mind the 12,000 miles of sea
                                    supply lines to India, the inefficient overloaded railways
                                    across India, the Japanese submarines in the Bay of Bengal, the
                                    trickle of supplies by air transport from Assam into China, and
                                    the problem of motor fuel which increases by geometric
                                    progression each stage that it is removed eastward from Kunming.
                                    The limitation of the long sea supply line cannot be eradicated.
                                    But the recapture of Rangoon and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands
                                    would go far toward eliminating the other restricting

                            British military strength, the conclusion is borne home that probably
                            nowhere in this war can we do so much with so little as in the
                            China-Burma-India theater. Realistic American diplomatic bargaining and
                            pressure plus American military commitments (the extent of which would
                            be scarcely noticeable in the Western European or Russian theaters) can
                            launch a train of action in this theater promising a maximum return for
                            a minimum investment.</p>
                        <p>The cheapest effort we could make would be to confine ourselves to the
                            operation of a relatively small air force from existing bases in free
                            China. This would not involve an attempt to retake Burma. The supplying
                            of this force would be accomplished by air transport from northeastern
                            India. Because of this logistic limitation, it would probably be
                            impossible to maintain long-range four engine bombers as part of the
                            force. Medium bombers and pursuits would have to do the job. Within
                            their range of operations in occupied China are many Japanese
                            installations, much Japanese shipping and aviation and tremendous
                            quantities of Japanese supplies, all of which are already being reduced
                            with conspicuous success by the pitifully small American Army air force
                            now in China. Yet this is not going to defeat Japan.</p>
                        <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0141"/>
                        <p>If Burma is retaken, the port of Rangoon made accessible to American
                            shipping and the Burma Road reopened, our increased effort can be
                            concentrated on intensifying and expanding the activities of the
                            American air force in China to include long-range bombardment of
                            industrial Japan and Japanese shipping in the Formosan straits and the
                            South China Sea. Sustained bombing of these two objectives will do more
                            toward defeating Japan than any other single operation. It is attacking
                            the roots and trunk of the thorn tree rather than the outer branches and
                            brambles. Furthermore, such an operation will tend to draw Japanese
                            strength back toward Japan and Formosa and so reduce the threat to India
                            and Siberia. If our plan is to concentrate on the China theater,
                            American ground forces committed to the retaking of Burma might
                            logically be used in the protection of advance American bases in East
                            China.</p>
                        <p>A third choice also envisages the reoccupation of Burma and the reopening
                            of Rangoon and the Burma Road. But instead of concentrating our efforts
                            on air operations against Japan and the Japanese lifeline southward, we
                            would, leaning <hi rend="italic">heavily</hi> on the manpower of our
                            allies, undertake an offensive southeastward from China and Burma. The
                            land offensive would be supported by naval action in the southwest
                            Pacific. These coordinated operations would be designed to cut into
                            Japan’s southern salient, so vulnerable from the west, and to reduce the
                            Japanese threat to Siberia or, if Japan has by the time this second
                            front is opened attacked the Soviet Union, to relieve the Russians by
                            diverting and dispersing Japanese strength southward.</p>

                    <p>936. Naval Attaché’s telegram 110541, August 11, to Navy Department<note
                            n="87" xml:id="d116fn87">For summary, see memorandum of August 18 from
                            Capt. A. D. Struble, <ref target="#pg_139">p. 139</ref>.</note>
                        regarding United States Air Force in China carried notation of my request
                        that contents of message be communicated to State Department.</p>
                    <p>Chinese have been critical of our failures to give them military aid while
                        substantial American support flows or is diverted to other theatres of the
                        war. This criticism has been partially offset by remarkable record made by
                        our small air force in China which has favorably <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132"
                            facs="0142"/>affected Chinese morale, military and civilian. I am
                        concerned over political repercussions and effect on Chinese morale which
                        would result from decrease or cessation of American air activity in China
                        due to our failure to provide support and replacements and speedily to
                        reinforce present small air strength now here.</p>
                    <p>There has been a tendency (1) to endeavor to justify American air operations
                        in China solely on grounds of their preventing a collapse of Chinese
                        resistance, and (2) more recently to integrate an American Air Force in
                        China with plans for retaking Burma and thus to justify its existence in
                        relation to those plans. Without underestimating the importance of our
                        support in bolstering Chinese morale and in making effective Chinese
                        resistance or importance of retaking Burma (plans for which seem to be
                        premature and impractical in present circumstances), I believe that an
                        American air force has a distinct offensive mission in China quite
                        independent of considerations mentioned above; that it has a positive
                        self-justifying contribution to make in the general offensive against Japan.
                        It does not appear to me that so few planes can be so effectively employed
                        in any other theater of the war. Chennault’s operations during past months
                        seem to me to have demonstrated this. Not only can he continue with a proper
                        force (1) to give effective aid to Chinese ground forces in offering
                        resistance to what we may expect to be an increasing Japanese pressure, and
                        (2) to contain in China and inflict substantial losses on Japanese air units
                        which otherwise could be diverted to areas in which American forces may be
                        operating, but they should be able, given proper support, (3) to attack
                        Japanese supply routes from Japan southward thus assisting in our operations
                        in South Pacific area, and (4) eventually to carry out raids on Japan from
                        Chinese bases as such bases are retaken.</p>
                    <p>I consider foregoing a conservative estimate of potentialities of an American
                        air force in China and, therefore, recommend that the most earnest
                        consideration be given to establishing and supporting such a force here.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday (Sunday) afternoon the Counselor of the Chinese Embassy called on
                        me at his request. The Counselor stated that he was bringing “bad news”. He
                        said that the Embassy had received from <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133"
                            facs="0143"/>Chungking a telegram stating that the present Chinese
                        Ambassador to this country is recalled and is to be replaced by Dr. Wei
                        Tao-ming. The Counselor continued, saying that the Ambassador is out of
                        town, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Soong) is out of town, he, Dr.
                        Liu, had telephoned to the Ambassador, and the Ambassador had asked that he
                        inform me of the message. Continuing, Dr. Liu said that this message from
                        Chungking would be followed within two or three days by an instruction to
                        the Embassy to inform the American Government officially and to ask for an
                            <hi rend="italic">agrément</hi>.<note n="88" xml:id="d117fn88"
                            >Ambassador Hu Shih on August 20 presented a note announcing his recall
                            and asking for an <hi rend="italic">agrément</hi> for the appointment of
                            his successor, Wei Tao-ming. On August 31 the Acting Secretary of State
                            replied, by direction of President Roosevelt, expressing regret at Mr.
                            Hu’s recall and agreeing to Mr. Wei’s appointment (701.9311/819).</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>There followed some conversation in the course of which I asked Dr. Liu
                        whether he would feel free to tell me whether Dr. Soong was in any way
                        responsible for this action on the part of the Chinese Government. Dr. Liu
                        replied that he was confident that Dr. Soong had nothing to do with it
                        either as to initiative or as to being consulted. He said that Dr. Soong has
                        been well satisfied with the existing set-up wherein both the Minister for
                        Foreign Affairs and the Ambassador are in Washington, each representing
                        China but operating more or less in separate fields and cooperating
                        effectively without crossing wires. He said that the Ambassador has
                        extraordinary qualifications for understanding this country as well as China
                        and for interpreting this country to his own Government and interpreting
                        China to this country. The Ambassador, he said, has constantly sent to his
                        Government thoughtful and carefully prepared messages dealing with
                        fundamentals in the world situation and explaining the workings of the
                        American democracy and the difficulties which have attended the evolution of
                        our policy and action in relation to the war and the United Nations’
                        military effort. The Ambassador has also interpreted and explained many
                        things to Dr. Soong and has been very helpful in counseling exercise of
                        patience and pointing out errors to be avoided. On not a few occasions, the
                        Ambassador’s messages to Chungking have evoked expressions of impatience
                        from Chungking; but the Ambassador has always tried all the harder to cause
                        Chungking to look at the world picture in its entirety and to understand the
                        difficulties which confront the American Government and the considerations
                        which determine its action. The Chinese Government, Dr. Liu said, is
                        confronted with many and great difficulties, and it naturally is impatient
                        of delays, feels keenly its desperate needs, and becomes provoked at its
                        representatives because they do not seem to get the results for which it
                        hopes. Of late, he said, the Chinese Government has been critical even of
                        its new Foreign Minister (Dr. Soong) because materials expected from the
                        allies do not reach China.</p>
                    <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0144"/>
                    <p>Dr. Liu made no mention of India. I inferred from this that the message which
                        the Ambassador had received from Chungking made no mention of the India
                        question. I deliberately refrained from trying to draw Dr. Liu out on the
                        subject of the Chinese Government’s reasons for the action which it was
                        taking.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Liu indicated, though he did not say so expressly, that he felt that
                        withdrawal of Dr. Hu Shih at this time would have a most unfortunate
                        effect—both as regarded Chinese interests and as regarded American
                        interests. I inquired whether there was anything that the Embassy or the
                        Minister for Foreign Affairs or certain prominent Chinese in this country
                        could do toward causing the matter to be reconsidered. I said that the
                        matter was one in which I did not see how the American Government could in
                        any way intrude. Dr. Liu said that he doubted whether there was anything
                        that could be done: the decision had apparently been made by highest
                        authority in Chungking; the naming of a successor implied that the decision
                        was final and not to be questioned. Dr. Liu doubted whether anything could
                        be done by anybody.</p>
                    <p>I then asked Dr. Liu to tell me what he could about the named successor. Dr.
                        Liu said that Dr. Wei Tao-ming had been educated in France or under French
                        influence; that he became active in China politics; while still
                        comparatively young he became Minister of Justice, that having been about
                        ten years ago; that about a year ago he came to this country en route to
                        France where he was to be China’s Ambassador, but was stopped because the
                        Vichy Government preferred not to receive at that time a new Ambassador from
                        China; that he has been in this country ever since; that he has a house in
                        Washington; that he has with him some of the members of the staff which he
                        was taking to France; and that he is married to Dr. Soumay Tcheng (who has
                        been a prominent figure in Chinese political and legal circles); and that he
                        does not have any intimate knowledge of the United States and is not as
                        proficient in the use of the English language as he is in use of the
                        French.</p>
                    <p>I asked Dr. Liu whether he thought there would be anything to be gained from
                        a possible conversation between an officer of the Department and the Chinese
                        Minister for Foreign Affairs. Dr. Liu said that he did not think so and
                        repeated that he thought the decision had been made irrevocably in
                        Chungking.</p>
                    <p>I asked whether the present Ambassador would be expected to return to
                        Chungking. Dr. Liu replied that he might or he might not, and that in any
                        case he probably would not leave the United States immediately.</p>
                    <p>I inquired when would Dr. Soong return to Washington. Dr. Liu said that he
                        was expected on Monday evening (today).</p>

                    <p>In connection with the information which we have been given that the present
                        Chinese Ambassador to this country has been recalled by his Government, I
                        make certain surmises and I venture comments, as follows:</p>
                    <p>The decision has been made by Chiang Kai-shek. The decision is a “political”
                        decision. It arises out of disappointment and impatience on Chiang’s part.
                        Chiang has been carrying a terrific political and military burden for more
                        than 15 years. Beginning in 1925, he first organized and led an army which
                        marched, fought and won battles all the way from Canton to Pekin. He ousted
                        the Pekin Government and set up the “National Government” in a new capital,
                        at Nanking. He met with political opposition from several foreign powers and
                        from various war lords in China. He won a number of important diplomatic
                        victories; he defeated some war lords; he expelled the communists from the
                        Kuomintang; he fought the communists on battlefields; he foresaw an attack
                        by Japan on China and he made military preparations for resisting that
                        attack; he had to restrain powerful elements among his own people who would
                        have brought on war prematurely; he had to decide in 1937 whether to resist
                        the Japanese invasion or to make terms; he chose to resist; he maneuvered
                        the Japanese into fighting in central China rather than limiting their
                        efforts to the north; he has held China together during five years of
                        defensive fighting; he believes, rightly or wrongly, that by containing
                        Japanese forces he has given Great Britain and the United States invaluable
                        assistance in terms of time for them to prepare for their own resistance
                        against Japan; he feels, rightly or wrongly, that China is an important unit
                        in the United Nations military effort in a global war; he has been promised
                        in large terms and repeatedly, generous assistance, especially of materials,
                        from his allies; he has seen assistance sent to each of several other
                        theaters in amounts infinitely larger than the amount sent to China; he
                        feels, rightly or wrongly, that the strategy which his allies are following
                        in world operations is making things more difficult rather than less
                        difficult for China; he feels, rightly or wrongly, that China’s voice in
                        allied strategy councils is given little consideration; he even entertains
                        doubts regarding the quality of the strategy and the capacity of his allies
                        in practical application to the problem of defeating Germany and defeating
                        Japan; he is a hard pressed and a tired leader. To him, the situation which
                        exists, most of all China’s situation, is the important and immediate
                        problem; not <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0146"/>the explanations and
                        the reasons which lie under and behind the situation. To him, the situation
                        as regards assistance from his allies is a situation in which the allies <hi
                            rend="italic">do</hi> not rather than one in which they <hi
                            rend="italic">can</hi> not. He has his representatives in the United
                        States. These representatives do not succeed in getting from the United
                        States the aid which he asks. The United States does not produce the aid
                        which he asks. He therefore is impatient both of his representatives and of
                        the United States. He has pled, he has argued, he has done everything but
                        make threats; and he has allowed some members of his entourage (for
                        instance, Sun Fo) to utter suggestions which amount to threats (in terms of
                        the possibility that China might have to cease her active resistance to
                        Japan). He now withdraws an Ambassador. This he does in expression of his
                        exasperation: exasperation because the Ambassador has not achieved what his
                        Government wants; exasperation because the American Government has not
                        cooperated with China to the extent to which he feels that it should. (The
                        replacing of Hu Shih, a capable and popular representative of China, is a
                        gesture with inescapable political significance.)</p>
                    <p>The important thing about all this, to us, is not whether Chiang is being
                        unreasonable or what may be said in condemnation or in justification of his
                        action. The important thing is that this is another indication of a trend
                        among the political currents in the Far East, especially in China. Until the
                        end of 1941, the peoples of the Far East, whether they liked us (and the
                        British) or not, had great respect for us and felt confidence in us. Events
                        in the Far East—to say nothing of those in Europe—during the past eight
                        months have greatly diminished their respect for and weakened their
                        confidence in us. For a long time before December 1941, Chiang Kai-shek had
                        been telling his people that they must depend upon themselves and fight
                        their own battle. He hoped, however, that the day would come when he would
                        receive substantial assistance from other countries that were imperiled by
                        and were opposed to the aggression of Japan and Japan’s European allies.
                        During the past eight months he has had many assurances that such aid would
                        be given him. He has witnessed, however, steady progress by Japan, repeated
                        defeats of American and British armed forces, encirclement of his own
                        country, closing of his lines of communication with the outside world, and
                        failure of aid in any considerable amounts to reach him. He has reason for
                        doubts regarding the intention and the capacities of his allies as regards
                        his country and the Far East in general. He has asked us over and over for
                        comparatively modest amounts of war materials; he has been promised that he
                        shall have specified modest amounts; he has seen the deliveries fall far
                        below the amounts promised; he has heard the reasons given in explanation of
                        non-deliveries; <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0147"/>he does not accept
                        the explanations at face value, he regards them rather as excuses; he knows
                        that certain of our representatives in China and in India have reported that
                        his armies and his soldiers are not and cannot be valuable assets in the
                        allied military effort; he knows that in military councils in Washington and
                        in London the majority of the conferees are preoccupied primarily with
                        considerations of occidental security and that there still prevails the
                        centuries-old concept of occidental superiority in practically all things
                        relating to capacity and importance; there is being driven home to him the
                        thought that West is still West and East is still East, that occidentals
                        still tend to flock together; he wonders inevitably whether orientals should
                        not, whether they like it that way or not, flock together; he has among his
                        associates some men who have contended consistently that China ought not be
                        fighting Japan; he knows that China cannot win against Japan unless she is
                        given substantial assistance from the countries which have given her moral
                        support, which now are her allies, but which, for whatever may be the
                        reasons, fail to give her military support; he has warrant, not for
                        entertaining the idea of making peace with Japan (which he has not
                        entertained), but for seriously considering discontinuance of active
                        military assistance [<hi rend="italic">resistance?</hi>] to Japan.</p>
                    <p>During recent weeks, American air forces in China have been making an
                        interesting and effective showing. They have bombed various Japanese
                        positions in China and they have destroyed a considerable number of Japanese
                        planes. In the bombings, no small part of the property destroyed and of the
                        persons killed or injured have been Chinese. The Chinese do not mind that,
                        so long as these American operations are extensively damaging to the
                        Japanese. But, one immediate effect of these operations has been the
                        bringing on of new air operations by the Japanese. In those operations, it
                        also is for the most part Chinese property and Chinese persons that are
                        damaged. This, too, the Chinese do not, for the moment, mind. However, these
                        developments create an obligation and a risk. We have “started something”;
                        it becomes our obligation to keep the thing up and see it through. We have
                        started something; we have created a risk that if we do not keep the thing
                        up and see it through the damage to the Chinese which our operations entail
                        will prove to have been damage without offsetting benefit. The current
                        operations of our air forces in China are “all to the good” provided they be
                        projected into the future, be sustained, be increased. If that condition is
                        not met, the present Chinese approval and appreciation of this effort will
                        evaporate, we will be discredited, China’s confidence in her allies will be
                        further impaired, and China’s whole attitude toward the United Nations’ war
                        effort will tend to become “sour.” By our launching of <pb n="138"
                            xml:id="pg_138" facs="0148"/>operations in China by U.S. armed forces,
                        we have put ourselves in a position where it becomes of utmost importance
                        that we maintain and extend the scope of those operations.</p>
                    <p>The United States has had a great deal to do during the period since the late
                        months of 1938 with the fact that China’s resistance has continued. We have
                        given China moral encouragement, financial assistance, some materials of
                        war, and a great many promises. Presumably we have done this for the
                        safeguarding and promotion of our own interests. During the past eight
                        months those interests have obviously become broadened into and merged with
                        the United Nations’ interests. Presumably it is desirable that China be kept
                        in the war and remain an active belligerent. This country alone is in
                        position to make the decisions and to take the action which will in major
                        part influence the course of events as regards China’s remaining or China’s
                        ceasing to be an active belligerent.</p>
                    <p>The reasoning and the decisions appropriately involved in dealing with this
                        question are political rather than military. In simplest terms, the question
                        is one of strategy in the field of distribution of war materials. But the
                        political considerations which are an element in this particular problem are
                        of greater importance than are the military considerations. The strategical

                    <p>We have been confronted with problems similar to this at other moments and in
                        regard to other theaters. Was not the decision to send large forces into the
                        south Pacific and to make Australia a base for operations against Japan a
                        decision based primarily on political rather than on military
                        considerations? Was not the strategic problem immediately dealt with
                        primarily that of defending Australia rather than that of defeating
                        Japan?</p>
                    <p>Should we not look at the problem of aid to China as primarily a political
                        problem and secondarily, for the present, a military problem? Is not what
                        has happened simply this: our President has viewed the thing in its proper
                        light; the President has considered it important that military supplies go
                        from this country to China; he has declared publicly, and he has declared to
                        Chiang Kai-shek in private messages, that such supplies shall go; and
                        thereafter, various of the operating agencies of the Government have taken
                        the matter in hand and, generally speaking, have found one reason after
                        another in impediment or prevention of the carrying out of the declared
                        policy?</p>

                    <p>The question which immediately confronts us is whether (<hi rend="italic"
                            >a</hi>) the policy of the President is to be carried out, supplies to
                        be delivered to China, and China to be kept in the war as an active
                        belligerent or (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the operating agencies of the
                        Government are to substitute, in effect, a policy (positive or negative)
                        contrary to the policy which the President has declared, supplies in large
                        amounts to be sent to many other theaters, merely a trickle of supplies to
                        be sent to China, and China thus to be permitted or even encouraged to cease
                        to be an active belligerent.</p>
                    <p>China can be kept in this war at a comparatively small cost. China can be
                        made a base of operations from which Japan can be greatly damaged, at
                        comparatively small cost. China and the whole Far East can be lost as
                        effective allies and, if lost, can be turned against the Occident—in absence
                        of and for want of a little more of effort on our part to convince the
                        Chinese that we mean what we say when we praise China for the fight she has
                        made against Japan, when we laud her as an ally, and when we promise to send
                        her aid.</p>

                            <p>The American Ambassador at Chungking has requested that the contents
                                of the following message from the Naval Observer there be
                                communicated to the State Department:</p>
                            <p>Heavy casualties have been inflicted by air attacks in Central and
                                South China on Japanese bases and on their air force which they had
                                augmented to meet these attacks. Chennault, with orders which
                                required him to defend only Kunming-Chungking and the ferry route to
                                India, took personal responsibility to demonstrate the possibilities
                                open to a limited United States air force in the area if assured a
                                steady supply of ships, personnel, and spare parts. The attacks were
                                carried out with the small force of six bombers and 40 fighters.
                                Chennault has been informed that at present there are no spares in
                                India, no replacements enroute, and no prospects of any. On this
                                account he will have to abandon in the near future advanced bases at
                                Hengyang, Kweilin and Nanking [<hi rend="italic">Nanning</hi>] and
                                will thereby give up the initiative to the Japanese. In addition to
                                the serious effect such an action <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140"
                                    facs="0150"/>will have on Chinese morale it will also permit the
                                Japanese to use all their aircraft in other areas. There remains the
                                probability of attacks on the ferry route by the Japanese next month
                                and the possibility of an invasion of Yunnan and additional pressure
                                on other fronts. Chennault has shown fully his ability to forestall
                                these possibilities and he guarantees to do so if provided minimum
                                force with constant supply of replacements for same. It is estimated
                                that 50 bombers and 100 fighters can be supplied with required gas,
                                spare parts and bombs by 60 C–53 transports. On August 10 the planes
                                available were, 8 P–40’s at Chungking, 10 P–40’s at Kunming, 14
                                P–40’s at Front Line, and 5 bombers in entire area.</p>

                        support to the Government in its foreign policy and in the conduct of the
                        war, and has helped to create the excellent state of unity which exists
                        today.</p>
                    <p>I particularly want him to meet you and your good wife, for I know that much
                        good will come therefrom. I want him to realize your many and great problems
                        and to tell you something of our problems as well.</p>

                        therefore to make appropriate arrangements with the Soviet Government to
                        permit the return of the aircraft and party from Chungking into Soviet
                        territory and their transit through Siberia to Alaska.</p>
                    <p>6. The Soviet Government will undoubtedly wish to make provision for Soviet
                        flight personnel to accompany the flight through Soviet territory. Mr.
                        Willkie on his part has asked that the Soviet Government be informed that he
                        wishes to put himself entirely at its disposal with respect to the routes to
                        be followed in the course of his travel in Soviet territory.</p>
                    <p>7. Please keep the Department and Chungking fully and currently informed of
                        all matters pertaining to Mr. Willkie’s travel to the Soviet Union and
                        China.</p>
                    <p>Repeated to Chungking in Department’s no. 762 of August 24, 9 p.m.</p>

                        strictly confidential instruction No. 1538 of July 1,<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d124fn7">See footnote 38, <ref target="#pg_71">p.
                            71</ref>.</note> transmitting a strictly confidential memorandum
                        entitled “China’s War Potential: Estimate”. In accordance with the
                        suggestion contained therein, we left a copy of the memorandum in confidence
                        with Mr. Ashley Clarke. He expressed his appreciation therefor and his keen
                        interest in the contents. In due course he wrote us a personal letter, a
                        copy of which is enclosed for the Department’s information. Subsequently we
                        took occasion to call on Mr. Ashley Clarke and to talk over both the
                        Department’s memorandum and his reply. He emphasized the general identity of
                        views of himself and his associates with the conclusions of the memorandum,
                        remarking that the points he has raised in the enclosed letter are, in
                        general, minor ones.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the third paragraph of his letter, we asked whether he did
                        not feel that the establishment of a continuous railway link from Manchuria
                        to Singapore, with the exception of short stretches in Indo-China and
                        Thailand, could constitute a probable immediate military advantage to Japan
                        in the event of a Chinese collapse. This he conceded. We also inquired
                        whether he did not feel that such a collapse would in fact release a
                        considerable number of Japanese troops for service elsewhere. While agreeing
                        that it would eventually, he thought that much would depend upon the form of
                        the collapse and whether guerrilla warfare would continue as factors
                        determining the number of troops Japan could immediately withdraw. He also
                        agreed that Japan would probably obtain greater access to a large supply of
                        labor and certain strategic raw materials. He went on to say that as far as
                        the immediate effects, however, of a Chinese collapse were concerned, he
                        felt that their principal importance would be psychological or political
                        (along the lines indicated in the Department’s memorandum), their economic
                        second, and the military third. At a later period, he believed, the relative
                        importance to Japan of the military and economic aspects of a Chinese
                        collapse would increase. The difference in the British and American points
                        of view, therefore, is largely one of degree or emphasis, and the British
                        fully concur with us that from every point of view a Chinese collapse would
                        constitute a major set-back. Personally, it is his feeling that Chiang
                        Kai-shek will never make peace with Japan and that <pb n="144"
                            xml:id="pg_144" facs="0154"/>such a development could only take place if
                        the Generalissimo were, in one form or another, eliminated.</p>
                    <p>As the Department is aware, the British are always sensitive on the question
                        of the independence of Tibet, which accounts for the mention of that
                        territory in Ashley Clarke’s letter; but he did not appear to take the
                        reference to that territory as “lumped with China” (Department’s
                        memorandum—paragraph 1) too seriously.<note n="8" xml:id="d124fn8">For

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Matthews</hi>: A little while ago you left
                            with me informally a copy of a memorandum prepared in the Department of
                            State on China’s war potential which the Department had kindly agreed
                            that we should see.</p>
                        <p>When I was in Washington I raised this very question with Mr. Hornbeck
                            and Mr. Hamilton. In the grave situation created by the cutting of the
                            last main route connecting China with her allies, it seemed to me that a
                            review of where we all stood as a result was a necessary preliminary to
                            considering what remedial action was most needed. In other words, we
                            here are only concerned with what would happen if China fell out in
                            order to decide what you and we could do to keep her in.</p>
                        <p>The paper which you gave me answers my enquiry admirably and we have read
                            it with the greatest interest. May I say at once that we are in close
                            agreement with its general conclusions? While we are doubtful as to the
                            material benefits which Japan would immediately derive and still more
                            doubtful whether Japan could maintain herself as a continental power
                            after ceasing to be a naval power, we hold the view that the collapse of
                            China would prolong the war by removing a potential base for striking at
                            Japan, by the extent to which it would relieve the strain on Japanese
                            resources, by the adverse psychological effect it would have on all of
                            us and by the encouragement which it would give to our enemies. For
                            these reasons (and there are others) we share the anxiety of the authors
                            of the memorandum to help in <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0155"
                            />maintaining Chinese resistance and we spend much time thinking how
                            best this can be achieved.</p>
                        <p>There are of course a few points in the memorandum which we ourselves
                            might perhaps have expressed differently. I was surprised for example to
                            see Tibet lumped in as part of the territory of China. In point of fact
                            the Tibetans not only claim to be but actually are an independent
                            people, and they have in recent years fought successfully to maintain
                            their freedom against Chinese attempts at domination. Their distinct
                            racial, political, religious and linguistic characteristics would seem
                            to entitle them, therefore, to the benefits of Chapter IV paragraph 2 of
                            the memorandum.</p>
                        <p>I should have thought that there were no advantages at all to be gained
                            if China were to cease resistance to Japan (see <ref target="#pg_13"
                                >pages 13</ref> and <ref target="#pg_14">14</ref>)! Nor can I
                            imagine that any of the United Nations entertain even a thought of
                            problematical advantages to be gained by the absence of China from the
                            Peace Conference. Finally, I wonder whether the implication of <ref
                                target="#pg_17">page 17</ref> (probably quite unconscious) that no
                            nation except the United States has been actuated by high motives in its
                            dealings with China is not rather sweeping? So far as we are concerned,
                            for instance, the opium wars are a long way behind us: and the
                            abandonment of the Japanese Alliance at the Washington Conference,<note

                    <p>982. Southern Chekiang is now free of Japanese troops and Chinese are
                        reoccupying positions as Japanese withdraw to north. Chinese reoccupation of
                        Chuhsien is anticipated momentarily and Japanese abandonment of Kinhua and
                        Lanki is not unlikely. It would appear that the Japanese plan to withdraw to
                        the position they held in the Hangchow area prior to the initiation of the
                        present campaign in May. Chinese report that about 60,000 Japanese troops
                        participating in the Chekiang campaign have been transferred back to North
                        China stations. It is understood that only one Japanese division is engaged
                        now in Chekiang.</p>
                    <p>Along Chekiang-Kiangsi railway Japanese are withdrawing eastward and westward
                        destroying towns in their wake. To east, Kiang-shan, Chekiang, has been
                        retaken and to the west, Tunghsien, Kiangsi. Linchuan, Kiangsi, also
                        retaken. Indication is that Japanese plan to withdraw to Nanchang area.</p>

                        opinion on what they understood Bissell’s attitude to be while in Chungking,
                        Chinese officials regard appointment as clear indication that China will not
                        receive substantial Air Force assistance.</p>

                        Government troops from Hu Tsung-nan’s command are already moving into
                        Sinkiang; and that Sheng is to receive some nominal position, such as

                        summarily cashiered.</p>

                        of Hu Shih by Wei Tao-ming as Ambassador is contemplated, but there is
                        believed to be undercurrent of opposition to the appointment of Wei as
                        unsuitable for the position.</p>

                    <p>995. The Government spokesman in his statement yesterday reviewed the war
                        situation and said in effect that Japan and Germany had passed the highest
                        of their power and that the Allies have now reached “the hour of dawn”. He
                        said, “The little investment of American planes in China has yielded greater
                        returns than anywhere else.” In response to questions after he had finished
                        his statement he further said that he did not believe that Japan would be
                        allowed henceforth to concentrate on any one sector and would not be able to
                        stage a full scale offensive against India. He said that the Japanese in
                        China hence forth will be “kept on the run.”</p>

                    <p>The Chinese Ambassador called to say goodbye.</p>
                    <p>I inquired what he thought of the progress of the war, and he promptly
                        replied that in his opinion there had been excellent improvement. He
                        proceeded to emphasize the Solomon Islands achievement as being highly
                        significant in every way. He then said that winter weather would be on in
                        Siberia within another month and therefore he was of the opinion that the
                        Japanese were not planning to attack Russia, but to attack India; that they
                        are moving considerable forces down to Indochina, Thailand and nearby areas,
                        and that it would be his advice that special attention be given to these
                        movements and their objectives. I thanked him for his views and replied that
                        I would bring his statement to the attention of the Far Eastern
                        Division.</p>
                    <p>In taking official leave of the Ambassador I complimented him on the
                        extraordinarily capable manner in which he had discharged his heavy
                        responsibilities during his tenure of office. I likewise emphasized his
                        outstanding contribution to Chinese-American friendship. The Ambassador
                        expressed thanks in appropriate terms.</p>

                    <p>The British Ambassador having requested an appointment to see me, came for
                        luncheon and a talk before and after.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Note: The Naval Attaché informed me this morning when he knew of the
                            appointment for the British Ambassador, that the latter was likely
                            coming in compliance with an instruction from London for an appraisal of
                            the China situation. The British Military Attaché had informed Colonel
                            McHugh that at a recent meeting of allied chiefs of staff in Washington
                            our people had taken the view that aid should be extended to China; the
                            British were of a somewhat different view, considering that China could
                            go on for another year without aid. In consequence of this difference in
                            views the British were calling for a reappraisal of the China situation,
                            asking numerous questions as to the authority of the Generalissimo,
                            whether it is still being maintained or could be threatened, what
                            resistance could be expected from the Chinese if no aid were given,
                            etc., etc. The British Military Attaché (a messmate of Lieutenant
                            Colonel McHugh, our Naval Attaché) had put these questions to McHugh,
                            quite frankly. McHugh understood that the British Ambassador would
                            likely be seeing me.</p>

                    <p>Sir Horace said that he had been asked from London for an appraisal of the
                        China situation; that, of course, he quite understood that a great deal
                        depended on what the Japanese do, but did I not think that the Chinese could
                        be expected to carry on, resisting in the manner they have been, for another
                        year, without further aid.</p>
                    <p>I told Sir Horace that I had been impressed during recent months by the
                        apparent weakening of Chinese military resistance; in the campaign of the
                        Japanese in Chekiang and Kiangsi, there had been no effective resistance;
                        our information had even indicated that the Chinese forces were under orders
                        not to attempt any determined resistance, but gradually to withdraw; that is
                        what they have done (despite their press communiqués of stubborn resistance,
                        overpowering enemy forces, et cetera). Now that the Japanese had
                        accomplished their objectives—of destroying the prepared airfields, of
                        breaking up Chinese troop concentrations, and of seizing as much as possible
                        of Chinese supplies at the air bases—they, the Japanese, were withdrawing,
                        and the Chinese were reoccupying the areas from which the Japanese withdrew
                        (not taking them by storm or heavy offensives, et cetera, as their
                        propaganda reports indicate).</p>
                    <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0159"/>
                    <p>No doubt abroad, I said, many observers, like the press, were impressed by
                        the Chinese military communiqués and received the impression that China is
                        fighting stubbornly and offensively and forcing Japanese retirement, while
                        we here know (and Sir Horace readily admitted) that such is not the
                        case.</p>
                    <p>I said that in endeavoring to explain the weakening of Chinese military
                        resistance as I had observed it over the past year or more, I had finally
                        concluded that the situation is not due to a decreasing will to resist but
                        to the fact that the Chinese military reserves in munitions, etc. are such
                        that they have determined not to use them unnecessarily; they have little
                        opportunity for their replenishment, and whatever promises might be made of
                        assistance in replenishing them, they would not likely use their fighting
                        power unnecessarily—not until they should feel that it can be used
                        effectively for permanent gains—or unless they definitely have their backs
                        to the wall and are making a last stand.</p>
                    <p>I said that we have, of course, been hearing of Chinese disappointment that
                        they are not receiving aid from the United Nations (Sir Horace interrupted
                        to say that some Chinese tell him that they were better off before the
                        allies came into the war!); that complaint has been loud and continuous, and
                        I noted considerable irritation as well as disappointment. On the other
                        hand, if my information serves me correctly, the Chinese have probably been
                        rather exorbitant in their presentation of their needs.</p>
                    <p>But, I said, you cannot expect Chinese troops to stand up constantly against
                        Japanese forces with artillery and air support—particularly air support—you
                        cannot expect that type of continuing resistance and you will not get it. No
                        foreign commander would expect his troops to stand up against artillery and
                        air-supported troops in the manner that the Chinese have had to do now for
                        several years. So that, when one asks whether the Chinese cannot be expected
                        to continue their resistance for another year without allied aid, the answer
                        is certainly “no”, unless of course the Japanese leave the Chinese forces
                        alone and there is no call for resistance.</p>
                    <p>Sir Horace asked what I thought should or could be done. I stated that I had
                        previously outlined my views on that subject to him in other
                            conversations;<note n="13" xml:id="d129fn13">See memorandum by the
                            Ambassador in China, May 26, <ref target="#pg_64">p. 64</ref>.</note>
                        that China must have reasonable air support—not a great deal and not more
                        than can be serviced at the air bases in this country—air support with our
                        own personnel; and there should be a substantial effort to bring in by air
                        sufficient raw materials or semimanufactured materials to permit the Chinese
                        small arms arsenals and munitions factories to continue operating and
                        supplying the forces in the field.</p>
                    <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0160"/>
                    <p>Sir Horace referred to the recent arrival at Chengtu of some 8
                        Lockheed-Hudson bombers (2 were lost by the Chinese bringing them in). He
                        commented that these bombers had been built by Lockheed for the British;
                        they are equipped with British type guns, etc., but the British had been
                        persuaded to release them to China. He wondered what China would do with
                        them.</p>
                    <p>I commented that that is not the type of aid that I had in mind when speaking
                        of air support. We all know that China does not have a trained air force
                        which can use these Lockheeds or at least use them effectively. My idea of
                        air support is support similar to that given by the Chennault task
                        force—planes, pilots, ground crews, etc. Of course, I said, a number of
                        Chinese have recently been under training in the United States. These
                        Chinese when they return could, if brigaded with the Chennault command and
                        given practical battle experience, probably prove to be efficient and
                        effective airmen; but if they are put into the Chinese Air Force under
                        squadron leaders without the requisite training and experience, all our
                        effort will be lost.</p>
                    <p>Sir Horace asked whether I had any ideas on the strength of force needed in
                        China. I commented that this is a question for the military men, but I had
                        understood that a force of about 50 bombers and 100 odd fighters, with
                        personnel, including ground crew as well as pilots, supplied by about 60
                        transport planes, would be about all that China could handle—about all that
                        the air base facilities in China could handle—and, judging from what
                        Brigadier General Chennault has accomplished with a very, very much smaller
                        force—they would be an effective air force in this country. But they would
                        need to be kept up to full strength. If to the 60 transports required to
                        service this force were added another 40 transports, it seemed to me that,
                        with the aid of the commercial air line as well (the C. N. A. C.) we could,
                        at the same time that we were supplying and servicing this air force, bring
                        in, in at least reasonable quantities, the necessary materials for the
                        Chinese arsenals and munitions plants. That, I said, was all that I had
                        contemplated by way of immediate “aid to China”. Of course there are the
                        swivel-chair johnnies who can argue that a force of 50 bombers and 100 or
                        more fighters is not enough; that the Japanese can muster overwhelming air
                        strength and blot out such a force, and so on and on. But Chennault has
                        shown what he can do with a small force—and when the Japanese came in
                        superior strength to “blot out” the small American force, he had shown what
                        he could do in handling that situation. Chennault has “paid dividends” and
                        substantial dividends with the small force entrusted to him. I should like
                        to see him have a larger force under his command. If the Japanese determine
                        at any time to move in strength against the Chinese at any point in China,
                        they can reach their objectives without question if China has <pb n="151"
                            xml:id="pg_151" facs="0161"/>no air support. But given efficient air
                        support such as Chennault has displayed can be handled, I believe we can
                        expect continued—and effective—resistance. That, I said, is the substance of
                        what we had to say to our Government in our reports on the China situation,
                        and I am convinced that it is sound.</p>
                    <p>Sir Horace said that he agreed, and that he had, time and time again, put
                        forward similar views to London, but apparently without result. All that he
                        can do now is to put it all together again and send it along.</p>
                    <p>He then asked how I thought the Generalissimo stands in influence and power
                        at this time. I said that the Generalissimo in my opinion remains the
                        dominant figure in the Chinese Government and Chinese resistance. Of course
                        his prestige among some of the military officers and the politicians and
                        others may have suffered a bit by the failure of China to receive
                        substantial outside support to win the war in China. He has always advocated
                        resistance and has expressed the opinion that eventually Britain and the
                        United States would come into the war and when they did, it would be won
                        with American and British assistance. He has been disappointed as to the
                        volume of aid he has received, and at times perhaps he has been impatient
                        and irritated over the situation. But notwithstanding any loss of prestige
                        that may have resulted, he remains the dominant influence and the center and
                        inspiration of continued resistance. I commented that some of the Chinese
                        military officers are reported not to have been enthusiastic for the
                        substantial Chinese participation in the Burma campaign and they now point
                        to the developments in Burma as justifying their views. Here again was
                        another disappointment for the Generalissimo; but he has survived it.</p>
                    <p>When Sir Horace mentioned again that the British had been “persuaded” to
                        release the Hudson (Lockheed) bombers for China, I commented that in my
                        opinion the diversion to other fields of aid to China was probably more
                        irritating to Chiang than would have been a refusal in the first place to
                        give it. It is my understanding, I said, that repeatedly, planes or other
                        military materials or equipment intended for—earmarked for China, have had
                        to be diverted to other fields—to Britain, to Russia, to Britain in the
                        Middle East and Africa, to Australia. We undoubtedly were persuaded that the
                        need in those areas was acute and immediate; it is probably difficult for
                        the Generalissimo to bring himself to the point of being persuaded that the
                        need there in other areas is always so acute that aid must be diverted there
                        and none come to the Chinese. His irritation is understandable; he is
                        interested in this China field principally, just as others may be interested
                        in their own theaters of war principally.</p>
                    <p>(It is difficult to get Sir Horace to express any views or opinions; he falls
                        back on the fact that he is new to China, etc., etc.; but I did <pb n="152"
                            xml:id="pg_152" facs="0162"/>get him to say that he had repeatedly
                        recommended to London that aid to China is essential, along the lines of air
                        support and personnel and materials for small arms ammunition and munitions;
                        and that all that he can do now is to get out his previous recommendations
                        and repeat them. I might record that it has been my understanding that R. A.
                            F.<note n="14" xml:id="d129fn14">Royal Air Force.</note> officers who
                        visited China to report on the need for air aid to China found that such aid
                        should not be given. This has been reported to me repeatedly from several
                        sources which I believe to be reliable).</p>

                        to inform him of the proposed visit of Mr. Wendell Willkie, the conversation
                        as usual turned to the world situation, the Generalissimo asking me whether
                        I had any particular news of developments. I replied that I had nothing
                        particularly interesting or outstanding; that, of course, we are all
                        watching closely to see which way Japan decides to move at this time—toward
                        Siberia, perhaps toward India, perhaps toward Australia, or elsewhere. I
                        commented that the Generalissimo had made accurate estimates in the past;
                        would he venture an opinion on the present situation.</p>

                    <p>He replied smilingly that he thought not; but then went on to say that he did
                        not expect a Japanese invasion of India this year, at least, because of lack
                        of available transport facilities. For the same reason he did not expect a
                        Japanese attempt to invade Australia. As to Siberia—well, he thought we
                        would know Japan’s intentions by the first of November. I commented that I
                        supposed that this was considered about the last date for launching an
                        offensive against Siberia, having in mind weather conditions. Dr. H. H.
                        Kung, who was listening to the conversation, indicated an affirmative.</p>
                    <p>I asked the Generalissimo whether he had any information to confirm the
                        report which had reached us in Chungking from several quarters that a
                        meeting of the Japanese Privy Council had been held in the presence of the
                        Emperor on about the 16th instant; those having this report suggested that
                        it indicated that the Emperor’s assent has become necessary to some major
                        decision. The Generalissimo said he had not heard of the meeting; but later
                        he said he had not heard of a meeting in the presence of the Emperor.</p>
                    <p>I had referred to the Generalissimo’s absence in the Northwest and gave him
                        an opportunity to volunteer comment on it; but with so many present, I did
                        not feel that I should ask for information on the problems which have been
                        under consideration there—internal problems. The substance of what has
                        transpired will reach us eventually. The Generalissimo commented on the
                        weather in the northwest, which he said had been cooler than usual this
                        year.</p>

                        Department’s information a translation of an editorial<note n="20"
                            xml:id="d133fn20">Not printed.</note> from the <hi rend="italic">Central
                            Daily News</hi> (Kuomintang Party publication) of September 11, 1942,
                        concerning the British Parliamentary Goodwill Mission to China.</p>
                    <p>The editorial extends a hearty welcome to the Mission which is scheduled to
                        leave Great Britain for China at the end of September and states (1) that
                        the sending of such a Mission at this time is a further indication of the
                        importance attached to the China war theater by Great Britain, (2) that the
                        visit of the Mission will afford an opportunity for discussion of military,
                        economic and other phases of the problems, including post-war problems,
                        affecting mutual cooperation between the two countries and (3) that the
                        representative nature of the Mission fully reflects the spirit and unity of
                        Great Britain.</p>
                    <p>According to a report released by the Press Attaché’s Office of the British
                        Embassy, the Mission is visiting China in response to an invitation from
                        Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. The Chinese press, has, however, made no
                        reference to such an invitation, and it is believed that the idea of sending
                        this Mission may have grown out of the desire of the British Government to
                        counteract the anti-British feeling existing among Chinese official and
                        private circles and that the visits of Mr. Currie and Mr. Willkie to China
                        may have given further impetus to the idea. There seems to have been a
                        concerted and directed effort on the part of Chinese officialdom to bring
                        about a more friendly feeling toward the British Government as is evidenced
                        in <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0165"/>editorials in most of the
                        Chinese newspapers on September 3 acclaiming the courage and resistance of
                        the British on the third anniversary of the British declaration of war
                        against Germany and in editorials on September 11 welcoming the Mission to
                        China.</p>

                    <p>It is realized that the War and Navy Departments are giving constant and
                        serious consideration to the question of maintaining and strengthening the
                        United States Air Force in China.</p>
                    <p>There are involved in this question a number of important <hi rend="italic"
                            >political</hi> factors. Among these there may be mentioned the
                        following:</p>
                    <p>In the recent activities of the United States Air Force in China and in the
                        air operations by the Japanese brought on by those activities it is to a
                        considerable extent Chinese persons and Chinese property that are damaged.
                        Such destruction the Chinese do not, for the moment, mind. However, these
                        developments create an obligation and a risk. If the current operations of
                        our air force are not sustained and increased the present Chinese approval
                        and appreciation of this effort will evaporate, we will be discredited,
                        China’s confidence in her Allies will be further impaired, and China’s whole
                        attitude toward the United Nations’ war effort will tend to become “sour”.
                        By our launching of operations in China by United States armed forces, we
                        have put ourselves in a position where it becomes from the political point
                        of view of utmost importance that we maintain and extend the scope of these
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>It is understood that the United States Air Force in China recently had only
                        five bombers operating and had only something over thirty pursuits.
                        Nevertheless, this force has made an amazingly effective showing.</p>
                    <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0166"/>
                    <p>It is realized that great practical difficulties lie in the way of
                        maintaining and expanding this force. Some expert opinion holds that these
                        difficulties cannot be overcome. On the other hand, General Chennault, whose
                        record of accomplishment and first-hand experience in regard to this matter
                        are probably not matched by any other person, is reliably understood to be
                        confident that, with a minimum force of 150 planes—100 pursuits and 50
                        bombers, preferably long-range—supplied by 50 to 60 transport planes
                        operating between India and China, he can carry on operations which will
                        make a distinct and positive contribution toward defeating the Japanese.
                        This would of course take care of the political factors involved.</p>
                    <p>The decision which the United States reaches in regard to the future of the
                        United States Air Force in China will, it is believed, be of major influence
                        in the course of events as regards China’s remaining or China’s ceasing to
                        be an active belligerent, as regards an accelerated or a delayed defeat of
                        Japan, and as regards a cooperative or a non-cooperative China in the
                        solving of post-war problems.</p>
                    <p>These political factors have probably been given consideration but in as much
                        as they are the type of factor to which the Department of State gives
                        special attention they are being presented thus informally to the military
                        authorities.</p>

                    <p>1127. Military situation in China at present quiet without indication that
                        Chinese contemplate major action or Japanese currently plan to do more than
                        hold strategic points and lines now in their possession. Reported recent
                        military action in Chekiang believed essentially of nature of skirmishes
                        notwithstanding Chinese reports of heavy fighting. Japanese forces still
                        occupy Kinhwa and Lanki and have retaken Wuyi. One report indicates that
                        Japs have recently experienced some difficulty with puppet troops in
                        vicinity of Nanchang. Military Attaché’s office believes reported movement
                        of Jap troops in Kalgan area no more than return of some troops to their
                        original positions; that there may have been some recent withdrawals from
                        China; and that Jap forces in Indochina, Thailand and Burma now comprise
                        only four and one-half divisions. The Military Attaché himself is scheduled
                        shortly to return from an extended tour of front line areas toward eastern
                        China and will probably have important first-hand information.</p>

                    <p>The political front has likewise remained quiet in past week without
                        significant developments in connection with either Kuomintang-communist
                        relations or the reorientation of Sinkiang. Chinese attention for the moment
                        is centered on impending visit of Mr. Willkie.</p>

                        in reference to the complaint of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs concerning
                        articles unfavorable to China published in American magazines and
                        newspapers, and to enclose for the information of the Department copy of a
                        memorandum of conversation between Mr. Shao Yu-lin, Chief of the Information
                        Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Edmund Clubb, Second
                        Secretary of this Embassy.</p>
                    <p>I learned a few days ago that at a recent meeting of the Executive Yuan the
                        matter of articles unfavorable to China appearing in the American press was
                        discussed, and it has also been intimated to me that at this meeting there
                        was comment on American press editorials regarding the retirement of Dr. Hu
                        Shih as Ambassador at Washington, there being some inclination to believe
                        that these editorials commendatory of Dr. Hu Shih and expressing regret at
                        his replacement were in fact intended to be critical of the Chinese
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>While I have been seeing the Political Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs<note
                            n="23" xml:id="d136fn23">Foo Ping-sheung.</note> recently—and since the
                        date of the reported meeting of the Executive Yuan—he has not mentioned the
                        subject to me in any way. If he had done so, I should have taken occasion to
                        explain to him in the usual formula the matter of freedom of press in the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Government and the Kuomintang are supersensitive to all criticism
                        or comment in any way unfavorable to China, notwithstanding that some such
                        criticism may at times be well deserved and perhaps may even be
                        beneficial.</p>
                    <p>I have suggested in my telegram that the Department of State may wish to
                        indicate the reply, if any, to be made to the representations of the Chief
                        of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>

                    <p>Needless to say, the articles of which Mr. Shao complained have not been
                        published in China. Respectfully yours,</p>

                        <p>I called by appointment on Mr. Shao Yü-lin, Chief of Information
                            Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, informing him that Mr.
                            Vincent (for whom he had asked when he phoned yesterday) was at present
                            not well and that I therefore came in the latter’s stead.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Y. S. Ch’en was also present, evidently chiefly in the capacity of
                            interpreter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Shao stated that he spoke on behalf of the Ministry for Foreign
                            Affairs. It had been noted, he said, that there had recently appeared in
                            American magazines and newspapers items unfavorable in their attitude
                            toward China. Representative of such articles he would cite one written
                            by Edgar Snow and published in the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Evening
                                Post</hi>, and another item, comprising an anonymous letter, printed
                            in the July <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi>. He gave me short
                            surveys of the two items in question “for reference”. He said that, when
                            recently news came out in regard to labor strikes in American industry,
                            for instance, the Chinese Government had kept that news out of the
                            columns of the Chinese press by reason of its care for Chinese relations
                            with the United Nations in general and the United States in particular.
                            He said that if items such as the article by Snow and the anonymous
                            letter were permitted to be published in American magazines and
                            newspapers it was to be feared that they might cause misunderstanding
                            between the two concerned peoples, and the Ministry therefore desired
                            that the matter be brought to the attention of the Department of State
                            with the aim that such items should not be permitted to appear in the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>I said that, as Mr. Shao of course knew, the American press prior to the
                            war was generally free from restrictions, that I was not myself aware of
                            just what censorship was being imposed at the present time, but that I
                            would lay the matter together with the Ministry’s request before the
                            Ambassador.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Support of General Stilwell</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary of War and I have personally had lengthy discussions regarding
                        General Stilwell. We feel that at least for the time being we should
                        continue to support him in the accomplishment of what is an extraordinarily
                        difficult mission. Our great objective is to re-occupy Burma sufficiently to
                        open up a supply route into China. The British cannot do this alone; the
                        Chinese certainly can’t manage it; neither side would admit of leadership by
                        the other. So our only hope as I see it is to secure guidance by an
                        American. He must be a troop leader rather than a negotiator or supply man
                        who would only serve to promote harmony at Chungking. We have searched our
                        resources and at the moment we do not see any officer with a sufficient
                        knowledge of the Chinese and with sufficient standing as a troop leader to
                        hope to secure either British or Chinese acquiescence for control of a
                        campaign.</p>
                    <p>Stilwell has spent almost ten years in China. I believe an officer without
                        some such experience would be utterly helpless in dealing with Chinese
                        methods, particularly in resistance to Occidental methods.</p>
                    <p>I know that Mr. Currie feels that Stilwell should be relieved but I do not
                        believe Mr. Currie realizes what this is going to mean towards the
                        accomplishment of our military objective in Burma.</p>

                    <p>It is hoped that your reply to the Generalissimo’s three demands, a draft of
                        which I recently submitted for your approval, will go a long way towards
                        clarifying the situation.</p>

                    <p>Colonel Timberman of the General Staff is departing by air today for China to

                        should not like to take any final action prior to his return.</p>
                    <p>It is therefore recommended that no action relative to General Stilwell
                        should be taken at this time.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: Mr. Willkie has kindly
                        handed me your letter of August 22nd [<hi rend="italic">21st</hi>]. He has
                        been a most welcome guest, not only to my wife and myself, but to the entire
                        Chinese nation. I am sure you will be glad to hear of the enthusiastic
                        reception extended to him by the populace in different parts of China. It
                        was a spontaneous expression of the Chinese people’s profound attachment to
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>I have had long and profitable talks with him, during which, among other
                        things, I realized more fully the consummate wisdom which you have exhibited
                        in grappling with the almost overwhelming problems that you have
                        successfully faced and which fills me with profound admiration of you as a
                        world statesman and a protagonist of human freedom. It was this unfaltering
                        leadership which has rendered possible the magnificent war effort which is
                        now being put forth by the American nation. I shall not fail to call upon my
                        fellow countrymen to strive to emulate the exertions of their
                        comrades-in-arms across the Pacific.</p>
                    <p>It is a matter for regret that Mr. Willkie cannot remain in China long enough
                        to permit of his observing conditions in our central provinces. He has,
                        however, visited several places of importance in the Northwest, which is one
                        of the bases of our armed resistance. When you have heard his report, I
                        would be greatly obliged if you will let me have a full statement of your
                        views.</p>
                    <p>Madame Chiang wishes me to request you to convey her kindest regards to Mrs.
                        Roosevelt. She appreciates greatly your kind invitation, and it is her
                        earnest desire to pay a visit to your great country as soon as circumstances
                        permit.</p>
                    <p>Always sincerely,</p>

                        Wendell Willkie’s return to Washington, I am sending you this message to say
                        how much our Government and people appreciate your sending him to our <pb

                        people of all walks of life as that shown to your personal representative.
                        Despite his short stay, Mr. Willkie has done much by his infectious
                        enthusiasm to invigorate China’s war efforts. I am sure that having seen the
                        facts in China with his own eyes he will be able to give you a correct
                        picture of China’s war efforts as well as of her problems and needs.</p>
                    <p>Knowing that you and your family are fond of Chinese tea, I take this

                        China of Mr. Wendell L. Willkie as a Special Representative of the

                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Willkie was given an enthusiastic welcome by the Chinese Government, the
                        press and the civilian population from the time of his arrival at Chungking
                        on October 2 until his departure on October 7. The principal streets of the
                        city were decorated with banners bearing messages of welcome to Mr. Willkie
                        and acclaiming Sino-American cooperation, and the streets were lined on the
                        day of his arrival with Chinese waving American flags. Chinese newpapers at
                        Chungking during Mr. Willkie’s visit were filled with special articles
                        devoted to his career, editorials approving his visit and items covering his
                        activities while in China.</p>
                    <p>Editorial comment concerning the visit emphasized three principal points: (1)
                        the genuine friendship existing between the Chinese and American people, (2)
                        the identical outlook between China and the United States and (3) the
                        necessity of all-out cooperation between <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162"
                            facs="0172"/>China and the United States during the post-war period. The
                            <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi> (influential independent daily),
                        referring to Mr. Willkie’s visit to the industrial areas, points out that
                        China’s failure to show a more significant industrial effort is due to the
                        “unequal treaties” as well as the insufficient efforts of the Chinese people
                        and the obstructive policy of Japan and appeals for the strengthening of
                        China’s war and post war economy through American aid, the need for which
                        Mr. Willkie will be able to see during his visit to China and for which he
                        will be able to take measures of assistance after his return to the United
                        States. The <hi rend="italic">I Shift Pao</hi> (Catholic) comments favorably
                        upon Mr. Willkie’s views of the post-war world and acclaims his attitude on
                        the question of racial equality and freedom. The <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung
                            Pao</hi> feels that the United States should lead the way in removing
                        long standing prejudices concerning racial equality and notes with approval
                        Mr. Willkie’s views pertaining thereto.</p>
                    <p>The dominant note of Mr. Willkie’s speeches during his visit to China has
                        been that of freedom, racial equality, justice and opportunity for all
                        nations and peoples, the pledging of all-out American aid to all her allies
                        and the painting of a favorable picture of American war production. Mr.
                        Willkie stated in one speech that his purpose in making this visit was
                        twofold: (1) to stimulate the war effort of the countries which he visits
                        and (2) to help build a post-war world order under which all people shall
                        have the right to determine their own social and political societies and
                        live in freedom and justice regardless of race, creed or color. At a final
                        interview with the press on the day of his departure, Mr. Willkie read a
                        prepared statement in which he emphasized the need for offensive action by
                        the United Nations, the necessity of increased aid for China and the Soviet
                        Union, and the belief that the principles of the Atlantic Charter should be
                        given concrete application to the peoples of Asia and that such action
                        should not be postponed to the post-war period but rather should be given
                        implementation now by all the United Nations jointly.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Willkie’s visit to China was cordially welcomed by the Chinese
                            Government. Elaborate arrangements were made for his reception and
                            entertainment, and for popular demonstrations of acclaim. Every effort
                            was made to evidence a most cordial attitude of friendship toward the
                            United States and toward Mr. Willkie personally as a <pb n="163"
                                xml:id="pg_163" facs="0173"/>prominent American, a “special envoy”
                            of the President, and a personage in American political life likely to
                            exercise great influence in American and world affairs affecting
                            China.</p>
                        <p>It is known to the Embassy that Dr. T. V. Soong, Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs of China, now in Washington, informed the Chinese Government
                            that Mr. Willkie (1) might be the next President of the United States
                            and (2) might be seated at the peace conference where issues vital to
                            China will be discussed and decided. He recommended, therefore, that the
                            utmost effort be made to make Mr. Willkie’s visit to China a success and
                            to do everything possible to win Mr. Willkie firmly to China’s
                            cause.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Willkie’s visit to China may be described as successful in that he
                            was well received and extravagantly entertained. He was extremely
                            cordial in his attitude toward the Chinese, energetic and untiring in
                            carrying out his program of visits of inspection, speeches, et

                        <p>Mr. Willkie has not held public office, nor, apparently, has he traveled
                            extensively abroad. His attitude at Chungking was perhaps more that of a
                            visiting prominent American politician than of a distinguished American
                            acting as a “special representative of the President”. Chinese officials
                            and other Chinese familiar with the United States were somewhat amused
                            at what they described as the American political campaign technique of
                            Mr. Willkie during his visit. Others not familiar with the United States
                            or foreign countries were somewhat confused and startled but interested
                            and friendly.</p>
                        <p>The principal observation made on Mr. Willkie’s visit was his attitude
                            toward the press—Chinese and foreign. He courted the correspondents and
                            newspapermen on every occasion, invited them to accompany him on his
                            inspection visits (although the official program did not so
                            contemplate), and ignoring his hosts—cabinet ministers—on such visits,
                            he surrounded himself with the press and encouraged them to record his
                            remarks. Upon his arrival at Chungking, he submitted to the press,
                            leaving his hosts (Chinese officials) waiting while he gave a press
                            interview. During his presence at receptions and other gatherings he was
                            quick to yield to any request of the press, abandoning his Chinese hosts
                            and going into a corner with the press men for as much as ten to fifteen
                            minutes. This attitude was rather disconcerting to high Chinese
                            officials, but they accepted the situation with typical Oriental grace
                            and Chinese good humor (if not amusement).</p>
                        <p>The diplomatic representatives of the United Nations were faithful in
                            their attendance by invitation at a number of functions given for Mr.
                            Willkie; but beyond the acknowledgement of introductions, he had nothing
                            to say to any of them, although he had recently visited in their
                            countries in several instances.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Willkie did not visit the American Embassy. The program prepared by
                            the Foreign Office contemplated that he would proceed to the American
                            Embassy and spend the first night at the Ambassador’s residence. A
                            cordial invitation was extended to Mr. Willkie to do so, but he elected
                            otherwise. The Ambassador accompanied Mr. Willkie on his courtesy calls
                            on the Chairman of the National Government,<note n="29"
                                xml:id="d140fn29">Lin Sen.</note> the Generalissimo and Madame
                            Chiang Kai-shek, Dr. H. H. Kung, the Vice President of the Executive
                            Yuan, General Ho Ying-chin, Chief of General Staff, and the Foreign
                            Office. The Ambassador also attended the official dinners and luncheons
                            given by the Chairman of the National Government, the Generalissimo and
                            Madame Chiang, and Dr. Kung. He held a reception for Mr. Willkie
                            attended by the high Chinese officials, the heads of diplomatic
                            missions, and the American community. He also attended the reception for
                            Mr. Willkie given by the cultural associations. On visits of inspection
                            to factories, arsenals, educational institutions, etc., officers or
                            attachés of the Embassy were detailed to accompany Mr. Willkie—at the
                            request of the Foreign Office. The Naval Attaché of the Embassy
                            accompanied the Generalissimo’s representative to welcome Mr. Willkie
                            upon his arrival in China at Tihwa (Urumchi). The Military and Naval
                            Attachés left Chungking with Mr. Willkie on his departure to visit the
                            Tungkwan war front. The attachés will return to Chungking from the war
                            front.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Willkie had several private conversations with the Generalissimo and
                            Madame Chiang Kai-shek. The Ambassador was not invited to be present at
                            these conversations, nor was he informed by Mr. Willkie of their
                            purport. It is the custom of the Generalissimo and Madame Chiang to
                            invite prominent foreign visitors for private conversations (seldom in
                            the presence of the diplomatic representatives) when China’s ambitions
                            are disclosed and there is often complaint and criticism on the lack of
                            sufficient aid from one country or another, and criticism of the
                            attitude of one country or another.</p>
                        <p>During the courtesy call on Generalissimo and Madame Chiang on Saturday,
                            October 3d, Mr. Willkie devoted most of the time to pressing an
                            invitation to Madame Chiang to visit the United States, traveling in the
                            Willkie plane. In response to an inquiry from Madame Chiang whether such
                            a visit would be likely to produce “planes for China”, Mr. Willkie
                            assured her that her visit would get all the planes Madame Chiang might
                            desire.</p>
                        <p>Generalissimo Chiang smiled throughout this conversation but made no
                            commitment beyond saying that Madame Chiang had always desired to
                            re-visit the United States and some day she might do so.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador informed Mr. Willkie of the desire of the Embassy to be of
                            any assistance to him during his visit, and to give him any <pb n="165"
                                xml:id="pg_165" facs="0175"/>information desired. Mr. Willkie,
                            however, sought no information or guidance from the Ambassador or the
                            Embassy. There were no consultations or discussions on Chinese or other
                            affairs.</p>

                        the Embassy reply informally to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs along lines
                        as follows:</p>
                    <p>The Embassy has brought to the Department’s attention the complaint of the
                        Ministry of Foreign Affairs in regard to certain articles appearing in
                        American publications which it regards as unfavorable to China and also the
                        suggestion of the Ministry that such articles be not permitted to appear in
                        the future on the ground that they might cause misunderstanding between the
                        American and the Chinese peoples.</p>
                    <p>The Department regrets that the Ministry should feel that there is occasion
                        for complaint about articles appearing in American publications on grounds
                        of their objectionable character.</p>
                    <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0176"/>
                    <p>It is desired to call attention to the fact that published opinion in this
                        country as a whole is overwhelmingly very friendly toward China and China’s
                        cause. In the opinion of the Department if attempts were made by this
                        Government to follow a policy of suppressing expressions of opinion of a
                        critical character such attempts could hardly fail to be regarded by the
                        public as invasions of the right of free speech and in a specific situation
                        such as is here under reference the public resentment of such a procedure
                        might well react adversely upon the spontaneity of the support which the
                        public has given to matters connected with China. The considerations
                        affecting this Government’s attitude toward the question of adopting
                        suppressive measures against public criticism apply as much to criticism of
                        this Government itself as to criticism directed against other friendly
                        countries and their governments. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs may be
                        assured, however, that this Government will continue, as it has in the past,
                        to exercise its influence and lend its guidance, as far as it can
                        appropriately do so, in the interest of maintaining and promoting a friendly
                        attitude on the part of the American public toward all countries with which
                        the United States enjoys friendly relations.</p>

                    <p>During the course of a call at his initiative prior to his departure for
                        China, Dr. Soong said that he wished to bring up for special attention one
                        question. He continued that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese
                        Government were very desirous that prompt steps be taken to recapture Burma.
                        He pointed out that Burma was of special importance to China in that with
                        Burma in Chinese hands much needed supplies could reach the Chinese armies,
                        whereas with Burma in Japanese hands China was dependent almost entirely
                        upon air transport service from India.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hornbeck said that he was one of those who believed that use of the air
                        was bound to become increasingly important. He added that he, however,
                        realized and appreciated the importance of Burma’s <pb n="167"
                            xml:id="pg_167" facs="0177"/>being recaptured from the Japanese. He said
                        that in his view it would also be desirable if the Japanese could be
                        dislodged from Indochina.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong asked that in our contacts with the military authorities of this
                        Government we keep in mind the importance which the Chinese Government
                        attached to the recapture of Burma. He said that the Chinese Government
                        would be very appreciative of anything that might be done to bring about
                        such a development.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Department’s
                        telegram no. 939 of October 9, 9 p.m. setting forth the terms of the reply
                        to be made in respect to the complaint of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
                        regarding adverse criticism of China recently published in certain American
                        periodicals, and to enclose for the information of the Department a copy of
                        a memorandum of conversation dated October 17, 1942 reporting the consequent
                        interview in the premises between Mr. Shao Yü-lin, Director of the
                        Information Department of the Ministry, and Second Secretary O. Edmund
                        Clubb.</p>
                    <p>It will be observed that Mr. Shao Yü-lin was apparently somewhat reluctant to
                        abandon the Chinese objective of achieving the imposition on the American
                        press of a measure of control which would serve to prevent the publication
                        in the United States of adverse criticism of China and its leaders; and
                        that, after having had explained to him the general nature of American
                        censorship in wartime and after his having in turn explained how strictly
                        the Chinese censorship functioned, Mr. Shao expressed the desire of the
                        Chinese side that, even as they would use the information as to the workings
                        of the American censorship “for purposes of reference”, so should the
                        American authorities take note of the Chinese procedure “for purposes of
                        reference.” Mr. Shao nevertheless expressed the appreciation of the Chinese
                        authorities of that influence on American public opinion which the United
                        States Government had exercised in the past for the benefit of China.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Shao’s persistence very probably was due at least partially to the
                        circumstance that the Foreign Office reputedly achieved a measure of success
                        when it recently protested to the British Embassy at Chungking against the
                        passing by the censors of the Indian Government of two articles written by
                        Mr. Edgar Snow for the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Evening Post</hi> (one of
                        those articles presumably being that which was the subject <pb n="168"
                            xml:id="pg_168" facs="0178"/>of the Chinese protest to this Embassy). In
                        that instance, by report, in spite of the opposition of Sir M. Zafrullah
                        Khan, Indian Agent General for China, the British Embassy transmitted the
                        protest to the Indian Government, which on its part promised that it would
                        in the future cooperate with the Chinese National Government to the end that
                        such articles should not be passed by the censors in India and stated
                        (evidently bearing in mind recent critical press articles and remarks of
                        Chinese officials attacking British action in India) that the Indian
                        Government expected similar cooperation from the Chinese Government. It
                        might perhaps be noted at this point that Mr. Shao Yü-lin observed to Mr.
                        Clubb, while depicting the workings of Chinese censorship, that unfavorable
                        news and comment regarding the situation in India was suppressed in China,
                        even as was news regarding strikes in American shipyards, out of
                        consideration for China’s relations with its allies. There is enclosed, for
                        the information of the Department, a copy of the strictly confidential
                            memorandum<note n="32" xml:id="d144fn32">Not printed.</note> of a
                        conversation on October 16, 1942 between Mr. Basil Boothby, Second Secretary
                        of Embassy of the British Embassy, and Third Secretary of Embassy Philip D.
                        Sprouse, comprising the report of the above-mentioned Chinese protest to the
                        British authorities.</p>
                    <p>It is the considered opinion of this Embassy that the Chinese authorities
                        will continue to endeavor to prevent the publication of information or
                        criticism tending to portray the weaknesses and faults of their leadership,
                        but that it would be a mistaken policy for American governmental agencies to
                        foster in the minds of National Government leaders the belief that, even in
                        those circumstances where their actions are without merit, they can depend
                        upon the United States Government for assistance in maintaining intact that
                        highly favorable American public opinion vis-à-vis China which has owed its
                        development partially to artificial factors. As stated in my despatch no.
                        661 of October 2, 1942 in regard to this subject, it is believed that
                        critical comment by the American press of Chinese affairs, if well deserved,
                        may occasionally have a beneficial effect; in any event, such criticism
                        should not be expected to result in any weakening of the American position
                        in China. The maintenance of that position would seem to depend for the
                        greater part by far upon such elements of military and political strength as
                        the United States may display in actual performance in the field of the
                        present world conflict, and only to a minor extent on the continued
                        expression by the American press and public of friendly sentiments toward
                        China: the present Chinese leaders are realists who are guided by practical
                        material considerations when laying their political course.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>I called this morning by appointment on Mr. Shao Yü-lin, Director of the
                            Information Department of the Foreign Office. Mr. Y. S. Ch’en was also
                            present in the capacity of interpreter.</p>
                        <p>I communicated to Mr. Shao essentially verbatim (without, however, using
                            a written text) the Department’s reply of October 9 to the Foreign
                            Office’s protest in regard to the appearance of items adversely critical
                            of China in the columns of American periodicals. I made that
                            communication in English. When Mr. Ch’en was translating the last part
                            of the Department’s reply, I intervened to make it clear and to
                            emphasize that the Department’s assurance that the United States
                            Government would continue to exert its influence and to lend its
                            guidance along appropriate lines to maintain and further a friendly
                            American public opinion in regard to friendly Governments and nations
                            (1) did not propose any departure from the procedure heretofore employed
                            to the same end and (2) had reference not particularly to China and the
                            case under discussion but was general in its import.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Shao asked if there did not exist under present conditions an
                            American censorship of publications. I said that there was a censorship
                            of information referring to military matters such as movement of troops,
                            the manufacture of new types of armaments, ship movements, et cetera,
                            but apart from information of that category the publication of news was
                            unrestricted; and, particularly, there was no censorship of the
                            expression of critical opinion by American periodicals in regard to
                            political and economic developments, or in regard to governmental acts,
                            whether on the part of the United States or of other countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Shao asked if the same censorship could not be applied to the
                            publication of material of a general nature as in the case of
                            specifically military information, to which I replied that I thought
                            that would be very difficult. I returned at this point to emphasize that
                            it was to be feared that any attempt to interfere with the freedom of
                            the press in the United States would probably in the event be attended
                            by adverse results for the spontaneous support the American public has
                            hitherto given the Chinese Government and the Chinese people. Mr. Shao
                            asked whether, after the formation of OWI, it was that agency which was
                            concerned with matters pertaining to the censorship of information. (I
                            believe that his question probably grew out of a particular reason,
                            perhaps not unconnected with the functioning of an OWI office in
                            Chungking.) I said that I could not be sure on that point, but <pb
                                n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0180"/>that I believed that the OWI
                            was not the responsible agency, but that instead censorship was effected
                            through such particular agencies as the Department of War, Department of
                            State, and the Navy Department.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Shao proceeded to outline the Chinese procedure for the exercise of
                            control over the press, observing that all information, whether it had
                            to do with political, economic, financial or social affairs, as well as
                            that pertaining directly to military matters, was subject to censorship;
                            and that the expression of opinion fell in the same category. He said
                            that this was in accordance with the concept of “total war”, and that it
                            was on that basis that the Chinese Government acted to control news
                            which it might be considered would be detrimental to the interests of
                            friendly states should it be made public. He referred to the case where
                            certain newspaper correspondents in India had reported the arrival there
                            of a certain number of American planes, stating that the Chinese
                            authorities in that instance had considered that the publication of such
                            news constituted an act detrimental to the interests of the United
                            Nations; and he said that, when there had been a strike in a shipyards
                            in the southern part of the United States—I suggested that it might have
                            been San Francisco, but Mr. Shao did not remember—the Chinese
                            authorities had kept the news out of the Chinese press. I said that
                            there was no question when it came to the matter of control of
                            information of a strictly military character, but that, as regards the
                            American shipyards’ strike in question, it seemed to me very probable
                            that the news was published in the United States itself.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Shao desired to be informed further in regard to the nature of
                            American control over the press, and I said that the State Department,
                            for instance, had a section which followed public opinion and the news
                            as published in the current press, that in the Department press
                            conferences there were sometimes issued communiqués, and statements of
                            policy, that there were in those press conferences exchanges of news and
                            views, that the press was informed as regards the policies of the United
                            States Government and for the major part could be expected to follow
                            those policies in time of war, but that if any newspaper chose not to
                            follow the Government’s policy there was still no control imposed upon
                            it (to prevent the expression of adversely critical opinion) . I
                            emphasized again that the American censorship was directed against
                            publication of military information only and not against criticism. I
                            remarked again that, as indicated in the Department’s reply, the Chinese
                            Government and people enjoyed a very favorable press in the United
                            States, and said that a few expressions of critical opinion should be
                            considered as bearing comparatively little importance when viewed
                            against the whole. I added that, in my personal opinion, the <pb n="171"
                                xml:id="pg_171" facs="0181"/>indirect approach to such problems was
                            sometimes superior to the direct.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Shao said in conclusion that the Chinese authorities appreciated the
                            influence the United States Government had exercised in the past for the
                            benefit of China. He asked whether what I said could be taken as
                            representing the American policy as regards the question of censorship.
                            I said that it could. Mr. Shao then said that the Chinese authorities
                            would use that information “for purposes of reference”, but hoped that
                            the American authorities would also take note of the Chinese procedure
                            as set forth by him, likewise for “purposes of reference”.</p>

                    <p>During a call at the Department this afternoon Mr. Hayter said that in May
                        1942 General Chiang Kai-shek had requested that the British Government
                        furnish some British instructors to the Chinese Air Force Staff College and
                        this had now been done. Mr. Hayter stated that he <hi rend="italic"

                        instructors in question.</p>

                        receive your letter of October 6, 1942, in which you were so good as to give
                        me the benefit of your observations in connection with the recent visit to
                        China of Mr. Willkie.</p>
                    <p>It was very gratifying to learn from you that you found your talks with Mr.
                        Willkie profitable, especially in the matter of acquainting you with the

                    <p>Mr. Willkie has told me of the cordial welcome which you and your countrymen
                        extended to him and of the full opportunities he was accorded for making
                        observations of conditions and for exchanging views with you and other
                        Chinese leaders, and I wish to express my deep appreciation for all that you
                        did for him.</p>
                    <p>I am happy to inform you that Mr. Willkie has spoken in the warmest terms of
                        the fine spirit he found prevailing among the Chinese people. I am sure that
                        his visit will prove of great benefit by enabling us in the United States to
                        visualize more clearly many important aspects of questions involved in
                        integrating our common war effort.</p>

                        from Madame Chiang. We shall look forward with pleasure to the day when we
                        can welcome her to this country and, I hope, you also.</p>

                        helpful attitude which was manifested everywhere in affording him the

                    <p>General Strong telephoned me today. He said that General Chu, Chinese
                        Military Attaché, had requested to see General Marshall. When it was pointed
                        out to General Chu that Military Attachés ordinarily come to General Strong
                        and that General Marshall did not usually see them, he had based his request
                        on the fact that at the last meeting of the Pacific War Council General
                        Marshall had expressed his view that Burma should be retaken. General Chu
                        was instructed by his Government to inquire of General Marshall whether he
                        was still of the same mind.</p>
                    <p>General Strong took the matter up with General Marshall who agreed to see
                        General Chu and repeat the views which he had stated in the Pacific War
                        Council, though of course in his personal capacity.</p>
                    <p>General Strong thought we ought to know. I thanked him warmly for keeping us
                        informed. General Strong said he objected to Military Attachés taking up
                        political matters with Chiefs of Staff. He did not allow his own men to do
                        this and he did not like to start it as a precedent.</p>
                    <p>I said we were very appreciative of that attitude. In the present case there
                        seemed to be no harm in it, and there was good reason for showing
                        consideration to the Chinese Military Attaché at this time. Conceivably,
                        also, the quasi-political character of the Pacific War Council might entitle
                        this particular request of General Chu to consideration.</p>

                        Burma early in 1943, the Embassy has no detailed or authoritative
                        information. It understands that such an offensive has been under discussion
                        and that it is with this idea in mind that <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174"
                            facs="0184"/>Chinese troops are now being transferred by plane from
                        Kunming to India, there to be equipped with lend-lease materials and given
                        special training. It is understood that there are now in India approximately
                        10,000 Chinese soldiers who escaped from Burma and that something over
                        20,000 more soldiers will be flown to India from Kunming.</p>
                    <p>From a non-military point of view the plan for the transfer of a considerable
                        Chinese army to India for an offensive against Burma seems to have an
                        element of impracticability about it but the Embassy, although it has
                        reservations on the subject, does not have the sufficient facts regarding
                        the military situation in the area to warrant it in passing judgment.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the general subject of an early offensive against Burma the
                        Embassy in its telegram no. 936, August 13, 1 p.m., expressed the opinion
                            <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> that plans for retaking Burma would
                        seem to be premature and impracticable. Recent developments of which the
                        Embassy is not aware may have altered the situation. The Embassy doubts
                        whether the Chinese army is prepared to cooperate effectively in carrying
                        out the offensive moves from Yunnan down the Burma Road and from Yunnan
                        against Indo-China which are mentioned in Consul Ludden’s despatch.</p>

                    <p>1288. Dr. T. V. Soong in first press conference since assumption of post as
                        Foreign Minister told foreign and Chinese correspondents on November 3 that
                        American war production was incredible and that he was tremendously
                        impressed by efforts and spirit of American people and by large American
                        army being built; that China desired establishment of United Nations
                        Executive Council from which would evolve international instrument for
                        dispensing justice and enforcing law and order among nations during and
                        after the war; that China will recover Manchuria and Formosa and Ryukyu
                        Islands after the war and Korea will be independent; that towards submerged
                        nations China had responsibilities but no rights and that China did not
                        aspire to be leader of Asia with aim at domination; that there is no need
                        for China to borrow money from America at present; and that post-war China
                        will concentrate on gigantic program of economic development in agriculture
                        [and] industry.</p>

                    <p>It appears that late in February or early in March 1942, in the course of a
                        conversation between the President and Dr. T. V. Soong there came up a
                        suggestion that Chiang Kai-shek send to this country a highly qualified
                        military representative; and that the President expressed to T. V. Soong a
                        desire that that action be taken. There upon T. V. Soong apparently informed
                        Chiang Kai-shek of this conversation and urged that such a military
                        representative be sent at once. [At that time the Chinese Ambassador
                        informed Mr. Hornbeck of those developments, saying that he, the Ambassador,
                        felt that this was not a desirable course but that he understood that the
                        President had indicated that he especially desired that this be done, under
                        which circumstances, he said, he and his associates could not oppose
                            it.]<note n="39" xml:id="d152fn2">Brackets appear in the

                    <p>On March 11 the American Ambassador at Chungking telegraphed the
                            Department<note n="40" xml:id="d152fn3">Telegram not printed.</note>
                        that announcement of the personnel of the Chinese Military Mission which was
                        to go to Washington had been made on the previous day at a press conference
                        and the Embassy, upon request from the Foreign Office, had issued diplomatic
                        visas for eight persons named. In that telegram there followed brief
                        sketches, with comments, of the members of the Mission. With regard to
                        General Hsiung Shih-hui, Mr. Gauss stated, “It appears that his place in the
                        confidence of the Generalissimo rather than ability as a military man
                        determined his selection”. [The fact that General Hsiung has the confidence
                        of the Generalissimo has been affirmed and emphasized by several persons,
                        including Dr. Hu Shih<note n="41" xml:id="d152fn4">Former Chinese Ambassador
                            in the United States.</note> and Dr. George Shepherd (a Canadian
                        national who has long resided in China and who is known to have been for a
                        long time a close confidant and adviser of the Generalissimo and Madame
                            Chiang)].<note n="41a" xml:id="d152fn5">Brackets appear in the

                    </p>
                    <p>General Hsiung and his staff arrived in Washington in early April. It
                        apparently was General Hsiung’s concept that his business was with military
                        authorities and that he need not concern himself regarding other possible
                        contacts. He did not call at the State Department or upon any officer
                        thereof. Late in May or early in June the Chinese Ambassador informed Mr.
                        Hornbeck that General Hsiung had been in Washington for some weeks and had
                        been shown little or no attention by anyone and was becoming discontented
                        and restless. At about that time there appeared in the New York press a
                        story apparently based on an interview or a press conference in which
                        emphasis was laid upon the desirability of better coordination of action
                        among the Allies and an account was given of General Hsiung’s mission to and
                        presence in this country and of the fact that no attention had been paid him
                        and no use been made of him. The Chinese Ambassador said to Mr. Hornbeck
                        that this situation was unfortunate in as much as General Hsiung had come to
                        this country on invitation of the President, and the Ambassador hoped that
                        something might be done to improve the situation. Mr. Hornbeck asked the
                        Ambassador to give him an informal memorandum stating the facts as the
                        Ambassador understood them. The Ambassador undertook to do this. Several
                        days later, no memorandum having arrived, Mr. Hornbeck repeated his request
                        for a memorandum. The memorandum never came. It was obvious that the
                        Ambassador did not wish to be involved. In that same connection, Mr.
                        Hornbeck suggested that the Ambassador bring General Hsiung to call on Far
                        Eastern officers of the Department and indicated that in due course he would
                        try to <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0187"/>arrange for the Secretary to
                        receive General Hsiung. The Ambassador did not follow up on this
                        suggestion.</p>
                    <p>Some weeks later, Mr. Lattimore<note n="42" xml:id="d152fn6">Owen Lattimore,
                            Political Adviser to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, 1941–42.</note>
                        talked to Mr. Hornbeck about General Hsiung’s discontent. Mr. Hornbeck
                        informed Mr. Lattimore briefly of antecedents in the situation and told Mr.
                        Lattimore that officers in the Department would be more than glad to receive
                        General Hsiung. Mr. Lattimore said that General Hsiung felt that officers of
                        the Department should call on him first. Mr. Hornbeck then took the matter
                        up with the Chinese Ambassador and through the Chinese Ambassador invited
                        General Hsiung to meet him and the Chief of the Far Eastern Division, Mr.
                        Hamilton. That meeting took place within a few days, and shortly thereafter
                        Mr. Hornbeck and Mr. Hamilton called on General Hsiung at General Hsiung’s
                        residence in Chevy Chase.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hornbeck thereafter took occasion to bring the problem of General Hsiung
                        to the attention of the Joint Intelligence Committee, with suggestion that
                        appropriate officers of the Army give consideration to the political and
                        psychological angles of this matter. Mr. Hornbeck and Mr. Hamilton arranged
                        for the Secretary to receive General Hsiung, and that arrangement was
                        carried out.</p>
                    <p>It is understood that General Marshall has received General Hsiung at
                        intervals and that General Hsiung has attended meetings of the Joint Staff

                        to make reports. [It is understood that General Hsiung has expressed an
                        opinion that these meetings are a “waste of time”.]<note n="43"
                            xml:id="d152fn7">Brackets appear in the original.</note> With regard to
                        treatment accorded under the categories of protocol and social hospitality:
                        — General Hsiung when he came to Washington chose to take a residence in
                        Chevy Chase (directly north of the Chevy Chase Club); he has established no
                        office or place of rendezvous in downtown Washington. Notwithstanding the
                        matter of distance, it is understood that high officers of the Army and the
                        Navy have duly called on General Hsiung. On October 10 (China’s
                        “Independence” day), some 400 persons, mostly from official life, including
                        the highest officers of the Army and the Navy attended a reception given at
                        his residence by General Hsiung. General Hsiung’s presence at various
                        “parties” has been noted by officers of this Department: for example, at a
                        party given by General Deane at the officers club at the War College, at a
                        party given by General Chu<note n="44" xml:id="d152fn8">Gen. Chu Shih-ming,
                            Chinese Military Attaché in the United States.</note> at his residence
                        in Bethesda, parties given by foreign diplomats, two parties given by Mr.
                        Hornbeck (one of which was for General Hsiung). General Hsiung is known to
                        have been entertained by a number of prominent people in New York.</p>
                    <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0188"/>
                    <p>It appears that General Hsiung regards himself as a personal representative
                        of Chiang Kai-shek and that he regards his presence in Washington as more
                        important than that of the Chinese Ambassador and the Chinese Minister for
                        Foreign Affairs. On the political and military side it apparently is his
                        belief that China’s position as an active participant in the United Nations
                        war effort is not given the attention which it deserves. Chiang Kai-shek
                        has, as we know, constantly contended for closer cooperation on the part of
                        the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union and China in the fields
                        of military planning, command and operations. General Hsiung apparently
                        desires that such cooperation be effected and be signalized by his being
                        taken into the organization of the Combined Chiefs of Staff. The fact that
                        China is represented in the Pacific Council (by T. V. Soong) apparently does
                        not, in the thought of Generalissimo Chiang and General Hsiung, constitute
                        representation of China in the military councils of the Allies.</p>
                    <p>The problem presented in this case is political and psychological. It
                        involves and calls for action taking adequate account of Generalissimo
                        Chiang’s and General Hsiung’s personalities, characteristics and
                        susceptibilities. The handling of it devolves primarily upon the War
                        Department and the Army.</p>
                    <p>There is little if anything that the Department of State can do over and
                        above what it has already done in relation to this matter. It may, however,
                        be not inappropriate for us to suggest that the paying by the President of
                        some attention to General Hsiung might be helpful. The President could,
                        probably more effectively than any other person or group of persons, explain
                        to General Hsiung the existing setup with regard to planning, command and
                        operations, and the considerations on which that setup rests. Granting by
                        the President to General Hsiung of an interview would give General Hsiung
                        “face”, which apparently is something which he feels has been denied him and
                        to which he apparently aspires. [The factor of “face” is of tremendous
                        importance in dealing with the Chinese—even to the nth person, the
                            Generalissimo].<note n="45" xml:id="d152fn9">Brackets appear in the
                            original.</note> Arrangement by some agency high within the Army
                        organization to accord General Hsiung at least a semblance of regular
                        participation in some type of deliberative and/or consultative activity
                        would also, it is believed, be helpful.</p>
                    <p>Whatever may be our feelings on the subject of the reasonableness or
                        unreasonableness of General Hsiung’s (and Chiang Kai-shek’s) concepts,
                        desires, discontent, et cetera, four simple facts which are of importance
                        need to be kept in mind in our consideration of ways and means: (1) General
                        Hsiung is of the “old school” among Chinese dignitaries, which school sets
                        great store by courtesies and everything connected <pb n="179"
                            xml:id="pg_179" facs="0189"/>with “face”; (2) General Hsiung is a close
                        personal friend, confidant and trusted adviser of Generalissimo Chiang; (3)
                        practically all Chinese officials are now substantially influenced by the
                        running tide of Chinese nationalism and are sensitive on the subject of
                        China’s importance; (4) General Hsiung is reputed to be a man “who makes
                        friends and foes and keeps them”.</p>
                    <p>It may be added that, although he does not speak English, General Hsiung has
                        a good interpreter, is studying and has quite a little understanding of
                        English, has an agreeable manner, and is easy to converse with.</p>

                    <p>1118. As you are aware I have been following the practice of having talks
                        from time to time with the representatives in Washington of the United
                        Nations, including, of course, the Chinese Ambassador, for the informal
                        interchange of information and comment in regard to current matters. My idea
                        is to meet with the Chinese Ambassador periodically, perhaps once a week and
                        when Dr. Soong returns to Washington, I shall expect to ask him to call with
                        the Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>The primary purpose I have in mind in connection with these talks is to keep
                        in as close diplomatic touch as possible with the Chinese Government in
                        order that the cause of our common war effort may be furthered by
                        increasing, if possible, a spirit of mutual understanding and confidence
                        between the United States and China. In this way I hope that both countries
                        may be encouraged to put forth greater efforts in the long struggle which
                        lies before us before victory can be achieved.</p>
                    <p>I want to impress upon our Allies that the United States is, of course,
                        resolved to carry on the war to a complete victory, and that while we have a
                        full realization of the grim task that still lies ahead, our confidence in
                        the ultimate success of the United Nations rests on hard facts. These facts
                        are, as events are already showing, that we of the United Nations have the
                        resources in man power and material and have the ability and determination
                        to use them in action which will decide the final issue.</p>
                    <p>It is my opinion that, while in the partnership in which we are associated
                        the burdens cannot always be evenly distributed, each of the United
                        Nations—and especially the principal ones—has its part to play and can
                        contribute materially to the goal to which we all have unreservedly and
                        completely dedicated our military, economic, and political effort. The full
                        cooperation of the principal United Nations to the fullest extent of the
                        ability of each will enable us all to press <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180"
                            facs="0190"/>the [war] more quickly to a decisive conclusion and by so
                        doing we may confidently hope to cut materially the sum total of the
                        sacrifices which each would otherwise have to make.</p>
                    <p>I am sure that the leaders among all the United Nations realize that the
                        maintenance of a united front is a matter of such supreme importance to the
                        effectiveness of our war effort that all of us should be constantly on the
                        alert to make that united front impervious to efforts of our enemy to
                        penetrate it. We must not allow ourselves to be influenced either by
                        propaganda which is deliberately designed to create dissension, mistrust and
                        confusion among the United Nations or by the loose talk of irresponsible and
                        ill-informed persons, which in its effects is sometimes no less insidious
                        than propaganda inspired by the enemy. We should all put forth our best
                        effort to the end that in our countries there is the least possible
                        criticism of any other of the Allies or of Allied high officials.</p>
                    <p>I have already communicated to you some of the general remarks I took
                        occasion to make to the Chinese Ambassador here on November 10<note n="46"

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Comment</hi>: It is believed that present situation
                        factors, including military and naval setup, climatic conditions, etc. in
                        the Indochinar–Thailand–Burma–Yunnan area are comparatively favorable for
                        the launching of a Japanese offensive against Yunnan. Recent estimates of
                        Japanese intentions have run to the effect that the Japanese are not likely
                        to move in the near future against the Soviet Union or against India; it
                        would appear that current operations in the Solomons need not make a drain
                        upon Japanese land forces available for operations from Burma and/or
                        Indochina into Yunnan; Japanese air forces in Indochina, Thailand and Burma
                        would appear to be sufficient for the covering of such an operation; there
                        therefore would appear to be no substantial reason why the Japanese should
                            <hi rend="italic">not</hi> make such a move at this time. In the light
                        of their reverses elsewhere and of their knowledge that American, British
                        and Chinese strengths are increasing in the China–India area, there would
                        appear to be logical warrant for the launching by the Japanese at this time
                        of an offensive intended further to isolate China (by cutting lines of
                        communication) and, if successful, to eliminate the major bases (Kunming—and
                        even Chungking) from which Chinese operations are directed and on which the
                        operations of the U. S. air forces in China are based.</p>

                    <p>You might care to say to the Secretary of War that you have been watching
                        reports bearing on this question—which is now beginning to be discussed in
                        the American press—, and that, although the comments from the field indicate
                        skepticism, you have noted that the U. S. military attaché at Chungking is
                        reported to have expressed opinion that there is a possibility of such an
                        attack and has indicated that informed sources agree that preparations in
                        China for defense of Yunnan are inadequate and that if Kunming were lost the
                        Chinese might be compelled to move their capital from Chungking; and you
                        might add that the subject would appear to be one upon which the War
                        Department might to advantage give serious consideration.</p>

                    <p>1430. In a friendly private conversation with me yesterday afternoon Foreign
                        Minister Soong on his own initiative referred to an article regarding me in
                        Washington Merry-Go-Round of October 28,<note n="50" xml:id="d156fn50">Drew
                            Pearson had reported that it was an inescapable fact that Generalissimo
                            Chiang Kai-shek did not like Ambassador Gauss and would like to have him
                            replaced.</note> which he described as “clumsy propaganda” and said that
                        the article had come to the notice of the Generalissimo who had desired
                        Soong to tell me that the statements in the article regarding Chiang’s
                        attitude toward me were entirely untrue.</p>

                        11 of October 22, 1942 “Japanese Military Activity in Western Yunnan”<note
                            n="52" xml:id="d157fn2">Not printed.</note> in which reference was made
                        to proposed offensive operations aiming at the recapture of Burma early in
                        1943 and to present below certain information with regard to active steps
                        which are now being taken in this area to implement plans for an
                        offensive.</p>
                    <p>Although it has not been definitely settled it is expected that operations
                        originating in Yunnan will be under the command of General Joseph W.
                        Stilwell and will be in conjunction with a simultaneous offensive movement
                        originating in India and under the command of General Archibald Wavell,
                        British Commander-in-Chief in India.</p>
                    <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0193"/>
                    <p>In the near future Central Government units will commence to move into this
                        province from Wan Hsien, Changsha, and various other parts of China. It is
                        anticipated that this force will eventually total thirty divisions. It is
                        understood, however, that there is still a certain amount of disagreement
                        between the Chinese military authorities and General Stilwell as to the
                        units to be moved and there also appears to be some divergence of opinion
                        between General Stilwell and the Chinese military authorities as to the
                        amount of artillery that the force should have at its disposal. It is
                        alleged by American officers closely connected with the preparations now
                        under way that there is reluctance on the part of the Chinese to make
                        available to the force artillery in quantities sufficient to satisfy the
                        wishes of General Stilwell.</p>
                    <p>The bulk of the force will take up positions in western Yunnan along the line
                        of the Burma Road, but a certain portion of it will be stationed in the
                        Mengtze area, southeast of Kunming on the Indo-China Railway, for possible
                        use in a diversionary attack against Indo-China when offensive operations
                        westward along the Burma Road are opened.</p>
                    <p>As Central Government units arrive in Yunnan it is planned to attach American
                        Army officers to the headquarters of the various units. It is not known at
                        the present time to what extent this plan will be followed, but it is
                        expected that the American officers thus attached will number approximately
                        one hundred. Certain of the officers have already arrived in India and for
                        the time being are at the Chinese Expeditionary Force Training Center at
                        Ramgarh until Central Government units begin to arrive in Yunnan. The
                        remainder of the American officers are expected to arrive at Karachi from
                        the United States about January 15th. At least a portion of the officers
                        have served previously in China.</p>
                    <p>The position of the American officers with Chinese units has not been made
                        clear other than that they will have no tactical duties. From conversations
                        with some of the American officers who will take part in the proposed
                        campaign, I gather that the theory behind the presence of the American
                        officers is that their mere physical presence at various Chinese
                        headquarters during the course of the campaign may dissuade high ranking
                        Chinese officers from disobedience of orders at critical moments or from
                        precipitate departure from the scene of action which, it is alleged, so
                        unfortunately featured the collapse of the Chinese Sixth Army during the
                        last Burma campaign. The American officers will of course also serve in an
                        advisory capacity. In addition to officers attached to tactical units,
                        American supply officers will be attached to the Chinese Service of
                        Supply.</p>
                    <p>The question of supply is one which is receiving attention and close
                        cooperation is planned between the American Service of Supply at <pb n="184"
                            xml:id="pg_184" facs="0194"/>Kunming and the Chinese supply
                        organization. I have been informed that during his recent visit to Kunming,
                        Mr. T. V. Soong assured General Stilwell that China Defense Supplies flown
                        from India would be used for the offensive operations planned in Yunnan and
                        not diverted to other areas.</p>
                    <p>The proposed offensive against Burma has been delayed to a large extent,
                        according to American sources, by the reluctance of General Wavell to commit
                        his forces to such a campaign while the situation in the Middle East
                        remained obscure. Now that Axis forces have been driven from their
                        threatening position close to the Suez Canal it is understood that General
                        Wavell is prepared to act against the Japanese in Burma.</p>
                    <p>It now appears that the previous proposal for an offensive against Burma from
                        Assam down the Chindwin Valley has been abandoned and that the main attack
                        will now be made from a bridge head to be established at some point on the
                        coast of Burma, possibly Akyab. Such action presupposes adequate naval
                        protection which is stated to have arrived already at Trincomalee in Ceylon,
                        having been released from the Mediterranean Sea following recent Allied
                        successes in that area. The total force involved on the Indian sector of the
                        attack is unknown, but will include approximately 30,000 Chinese troops who
                        are now undergoing training with American equipment at the Chinese
                        Expetionary Force Training Center at Ramgarh. As stated previously, the
                        force operating on the Yunnan sector of the attack will total approximately
                        thirty Chinese divisions.</p>
                    <p>Because of the delay mentioned, time is growing short and it is necessary
                        that the offensive be pressed to a conclusion before the monsoon rains halt
                        operations about the middle of next May. There appears to be some
                        apprehension on the part of American officers connected with the present
                        plans that there has been too much delay and too much talk in India with
                        regard to the offensive and they feel that the initiative may be taken from
                        Allied hands by a Japanese attack in Yunnan before sufficiently effective
                        forces can be moved to the Salween River front to carry out the plan.</p>
                    <p>As previously reported in my despatch no. 23 of November 25, 1942 “Chinese
                        Military Strength Along Salween River”,<note n="53" xml:id="d157fn3">Not
                            printed.</note> the Chinese troops at present in that sector are not
                        believed to be able effectively to halt any determined Japanese drive up the
                        Burma Road because of inadequate equipment and general physical
                        debility.</p>
                    <p>Although there has been some minor Japanese military activity north of
                        Tengyueh in recent weeks, very probably looting forays, it is not believed
                        that the Japanese are planning a crossing of the Salween in the immediate
                        future. Aerial reconnaissance by American pilots confirm this belief.</p>
                    <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0195"/>
                    <p>At the present time it is estimated that there are approximately 100,000
                        Japanese troops in Burma, or about six divisions. Although definite
                        information is not available it is thought possible that the Japanese now
                        have either rail or highway routes in operation from Saigon to Mandalay via
                        Bangkok and are in position effectively to reinforce their Burma garrison
                        with great speed in case of necessity.<note n="54" xml:id="d157fn4">In a
                            memorandum of January 20, 1943, addressed to the Secretary of State and
                            the Under Secretary of State (Welles), the Chief of the Division of Far
                            Eastern Affairs (Hamilton) observed: “This despatch is extremely

                            Political Relations (Hornbeck) commented in a memorandum of January 23,
                            1943: “The information … although exceedingly interesting, would seem in
                            large measure to be ‘washed out’ by current news to the effect that
                            General Wavell takes the position that a campaign for the retaking of
                            Burma cannot be undertaken until after the situation in North Africa has
                            been completely cleared up. S. K. H.”.</note>

                            Roosevelt with memorandum of December 18, 1942 from Lauchlin Currie, who
                            explained that the letter when approved by the President would be signed
                            by Owen Lattimore and carried to China by the new Naval Attaché (Lt.
                            Col. Charles C. Brown, U. S. M. C.) “which should insure its safe and
                            uncensored delivery.” President Roosevelt, who revised the draft, in a
                            memorandum of December 22 asked his Military Aide, General Watson, to
                            arrange for Mr. Lattimore to see him on December 23 or 24, when the

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Generalissimo</hi>: Several days ago I had an
                        interview with the President in which I mentioned to him your views on
                        certain matters as you discussed them with me just before I left China. The
                        President asked me to draft a telegram to be approved by him and sent
                        through Currie’s code. The following telegram has accordingly just been
                        sent.</p>
                    <p>The President wishes me to convey to you in the most cordial and sympathetic
                        way that he feels that there is a basic similarity, indeed a basic
                        agreement, between the way in which he is thinking about these major
                        problems and the way you are thinking about them. This is a great
                        encouragement to him, because when two men are alike in their way of
                        thinking, it is always easier to come to similar solutions, even when the
                        problems that have to be solved are very difficult. In order to avoid any
                        possibility of confusion when these problems, in due course of time, come to
                        be discussed through regular channels, the President does not wish to
                        embarrass you by seeming to commit either you or himself in advance.
                        However, broadly speaking, this is the way in which his mind is
                            running.<note n="56" xml:id="d158fn6">This sentence deleted by President

                    <p>1. [I told the President that broadly speaking the following is the way my
                        mind is running.]<note n="57" xml:id="d158fn7">Bracketed sentence inserted

                    <p>In certain colonial areas it will hardly be desirable to restore the previous
                        regimes in full, even if that were possible. It may be possible in many
                        instances to find a solution through a new legal application of the concept
                        of trusteeship. Some such trusteeship might be entrusted to a single nation,
                        others to boards of trustees composed of nationals of several nations. These
                        boards of trustees would represent an advance over the mandate of the League
                        of Nations because they could be used to define more clearly the importance
                        of time and the principle of “coming of age.” This would be analogous to the
                        principle of successive stages of self-government embodied in the American
                        schedule for Philippine independence. The President finds [<hi rend="italic"

                        Only if they work together can they have uniformity of practice in working
                        out a method for the periodic inspection of the armaments of all countries
                        in order to prevent surreptitious re-armament for purposes of aggression.
                        China and America have obvious qualifications as the most responsible powers
                        in a large area of the western Pacific. In the northern part of the Pacific,
                        however, where American territory approaches closely to Siberia, Korea, and
                        Japan, it would be undesirable to attempt to exclude Russia from such
                        problems as the independence of Korea. To isolate Soviet Russia in this area
                        of the world would run the danger of creating tension instead of relieving
                        tension. South of Korea the question of actual bases from which China and
                        America might protect the peace of the western Pacific is one of those
                        details which may well be left for later consideration. The President is
                        much impressed by your clear view that only bases in the two key areas of
                        Liaotung and Formosa can effectively coordinate land, sea and air power for
                        the long term prevention of renewed aggression.<note n="59"

                    <p>1541. Chang Tao-fan, new Minister of Information, in first press conference
                        since assumption of office stated China received news of offensive in Burma
                        with delight and that he hoped drive would mark beginning of organized
                        offensive against Japanese in Burma. In reply to question concerning
                        possible cooperation of Chinese forces in Yunnan with Allied forces invading
                        Burma he stated that question [was] one for military strategists but that he
                        believed Chinese forces fully prepared to join in such action when
                        opportunity arises. He asserted that psychological effect on Chinese people
                        of recapture of Burma would be so tremendous that result would be not only
                        reopening of Burma road but also hastening of United Nations victory.
                        Minister in reply to question concerning American aid to China said flow of
                        supplies to China depended chiefly on transportation and that “China is
                        doing her best to put every available means of transportation into service
                        in order to accelerate flow of materials into this country”. He stated that
                        China hoped that more transport planes would be made available for her use,
                        for that would solve an important part of China’s needs.</p>

                    <p>1567. Doctor K. C. Wu, Political Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, acting as
                        Government spokesman at weekly press conference December 29, stated China
                        faces new year with brightest future from military, political and economic
                        standpoint but hopes that Allied counter offensive can soon be launched in
                        Far East; that Chinese resistance for 5 years has proved China’s ability to
                        withstand alone Japanese onslaught so far as war in China was concerned;
                        that Chinese prosecution of war was hampered by shortage of material
                        necessary for large scale counter-offensive; that China will immediately
                        counter-attack and recover lost territory if furnished equipment; and that
                        “we hope that the material promised us will be forthcoming.” He asserted
                        that United Nations have tendency to over emphasize European front while
                        under emphasizing war in Asia; that war in Europe has reached turning point
                        with operations in North Africa and Russian successes; and that while
                        Americans and Australians have “shown up very well” in South Pacific they
                        have not started counter offensive; and concluded with warning against
                        complacency and over optimism, stating last lap of journey is usually the
                        hardest.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary of State refers to enclosure no. 1 of the Embassy’s despatch
                        No. 693, dated October 21, 1942 concerning a Chinese complaint regarding
                        adverse criticism appearing in American periodicals, indicating some
                        misunderstanding on the part of Second Secretary O. Edmund Clubb, with
                        reference to the operation of American censorship.</p>
                    <p>In his conversation with Mr. Shao Yu-Lin, Mr. Clubb stated that it was his
                        opinion that censorship of information was not performed by the OWI but was
                        effected through such particular agencies as the War Department, State
                        Department, and the Navy Department.</p>
                    <p>In this connection reference is made to Diplomatic Serial Number 3524 of July
                        3, 1942,<note n="62a" xml:id="d162fn1">Not printed.</note> which transmits
                        copies of the revised Code of Wartime Practices for the American Press,
                        issued by the Office of Censorship, and that agency’s press release of June
                        24, 1942 setting forth the reasons why the revisions contained in that code
                        are necessary. There is enclosed for the information of the Embassy, the
                        original Code of Wartime Practices for the American Press issued by the
                        Office of Censorship on January 15, 1942.<note n="63" xml:id="d162fn2">Not
                            attached to file copy of this document.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Office of Censorship under the direction of Mr. Byron Price, is the sole
                        agency responsible for enforcing the Code just mentioned. The heart of that
                        Code is that each journalist ask himself in reference to what he is writing:
                        “Is this information I would like to have if I were the enemy?”, and then
                        act accordingly. If the writer is in doubt on this subject or if his
                        material seems to him to come from doubtful authority or to be in conflict
                        with the general aims of wartime censorship, the Code requests that he
                        submit his article to the Office of Censorship. But unless his article is to
                        be transmitted outside of the United States, through the open mail, by cable
                        or by radio—in which case its submission to Censorship is automatic—he is
                        under no legal compulsion to submit his piece to the Office of Censorship.
                        Thus, the operation of wartime censorship in this country is on a purely
                        voluntary basis.</p>
                    <p>This Department exercises no direct functions in regard to censorship, but
                        occasionally the Office of Censorship refers to the Department of State
                        articles or news stories of a questionable character, merely for guidance as
                        to whether or not such articles or news stories would be detrimental to the
                        foreign policy of this Government. The suppression, or even revision, of any
                        such article or news story may not be effected unless it is in violation of
                        a specific clause of the Code of Wartime Practices for the American
                        Press.</p>

                        China from Burma and/or Indochina.</p>
                    <p>Without considering the factual likelihood of an immediate attack on Yunnan
                        Province, it may be pointed out that the Japanese probably have one strong
                        incentive for making such an attack, in addition to the objectives usually
                        mentioned of (1) closing the back door of China to foreign aid, and (2)
                        making a drive on Chungking feasible. This third objective would be the
                        opening of a land route from Haiphong to Rangoon, using existing rail and
                        highway facilities. While the Haiphong–Kunming railway has been partly
                        destroyed by the Chinese for a distance of possibly 200 kilometers northward
                        from the Indochina–Yunnan border (rails have been taken up in this stretch,
                        bridges and tunnels largely demolished), the Japanese could probably put the
                        entire Yunnan section of the line into operation within a reasonable length
                        of time by the use of impressed coolie labor. The roadbed has not been
                        effectually destroyed. From Kunming the Burma Road leads directly to the
                        Japanese-held railhead at Lashio, Burma. Control of this route would reduce
                        considerably the strain on Japanese shipping while affording ready means for
                        supporting defense of Burma against Allied attempts to reestablish a land
                        route to China through Burma or an offensive against India.</p>
                    <p>The possibility of Japanese success in occupying this new route is probably
                        greater than would be the chances of complete seizure of the
                        Peiping-Hankow-Canton rail line as part of a land route from Korea to
                        Bangkok (or Singapore). The eastern Yunnan terrain is considered by many
                        commentators as impossible for military advance, given characteristic
                        Chinese resistance. However, the Japanese attack from Indochina would
                        probably be a holding operation to divert Chinese forces, while the main
                        drive would be along the Burma Road. The capture of Kunming from this
                        direction, which is not regarded as impossible, would then probably nullify
                        the Chinese resistance in eastern Yunnan, as Japanese forces could thrust
                        down the railway or roadbed from Kunming to complete a pincers movement
                        against Chinese troops in that area.</p>

                    <p>This telegram is not the only evidence of a deteriorating situation in China.
                        There is also evidence of discontent, inefficiency, and the like in Mr.

                        will undoubtedly strengthen the peace party in Chungking and those officials
                        who, even if they don’t want peace, want to prosecute the war at a
                        pedestrian level. Radio propaganda is not enough.</p>

                        Yunnan Province a military force, say, an artillery unit, even though it be
                        only of token size? Such a step would presumably please the Chinese
                        authorities and give them a sense of unity with the other allied forces.
                        India is not at present under attack and perhaps some Indian unit or units
                        could be spared.</p>

                    <p>22. Reference Department’s No. 6, January 3, 7 p.m. As the situation
                        clarifies we do not consider the recent government changes as indicating any
                        schism in the government or party on the policy of resistance, or as a
                        weakening of the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek. The appointments suggest
                        simply an emphasis upon extending and strengthening party control.</p>
                    <p>The Kuomintang is a congeries of conservative personalities and cliques
                        representing varying shades of opinion or indifference with <pb n="193"
                            xml:id="pg_193" facs="0203"/>regard to resistance to Japan, cooperation
                        with the democracies, internal administration, and reform in both economic
                        and political spheres. The common denominator of these various elements
                        including the Generalissimo and his intimate associates is their
                        determination to preserve Kuomintang control of the Government and people.
                        Party tutelage as a means to an end has in great measure given way to one
                        party control as an end. Leaders of the party appear to have a very real
                        concern that the failure to solve internal problems such as those connected
                        with local administration, land tenure, and the “people’s livelihood” may
                        after the war result in a formidable popular reaction against the party
                        control. The party has for years given lip service to reform and improvement
                        but little of tangible character has been accomplished. The strengthening of
                        party control therefore has now become a matter of primary concern.</p>
                    <p>The following individuals and groups are prominent in the party: the “CC”
                        clique (Chen Li-fu, brother, and adherents) who believe in a close party
                        supervision over social affairs; Chu Chia-hua and adherents who work for
                        strict party regimentation of a totalitarian type; the military element
                        headed by Ho Ying-chin which is inclined toward party domination and
                        military conservatism and is strongly anti-Communist; Tai Li who operates a
                        formidable secret political police system; and the so-called political
                        science group the adherents of which have the common characteristic of being
                        predominantly Chinese in outlook. All of these groups recognize leadership
                        in the Generalissimo who, also conservative, holds the dominant position but
                        tempers his leadership toward harmony with all groups while insisting as a
                        fundamental principle on resistance to Japan.</p>
                    <p>I am sanguine with regard to the role China will play in this war but I
                        define the reasonable limits of that role until we ourselves turn back the
                        tide of Japanese aggression as continuance of military resistance along the
                        lines of the past four years and resistance to Japanese peace overtures or
                        compromise.</p>

                    <p>Recent diplomatic activity of the Chinese Government toward cementing closer
                        relations with governments of the Moslem world, such as the conclusion of a
                        treaty with Iraq, negotiations with Iran and the exchange of diplomatic
                        representatives with Egypt recalls <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0204"
                        />China’s long history of relations with the Arabs and the Turks. The
                        convening on March 30 at Chungking of a national Moslem conference of
                        representatives from sixteen provinces serves as a reminder that China has a
                        considerable Mohammedan population.</p>
                    <p>At the conference mentioned General Pai Chung-hsi,<note n="8"
                            xml:id="d167fn8">Deputy Chief of Staff of the Chinese Supreme National
                            Defense Council.</note> chairman of the conference, called upon the “60
                        million” Moslems of China to band together in the cause of “resistance and
                        reconstruction”. General Pai’s figure for the number of Moslems in China is
                        undoubtedly greatly exaggerated. According to the <hi rend="italic">China
                            Year Book</hi> it is officially estimated that Mohammedanism is a
                        religion of from 15 to 20 millions of people in China. Broomhall estimates
                        their numbers at from 5 to 10 million. J. R. Mott’s estimate in “Moslem
                        World of Today” is 8 million. In view of the fact that nowhere except in
                        certain sparsely populated areas such as Sinkiang and certain parts of
                        Yunnan, Kansu, and Shensi do the Mohammedans constitute a majority or even a
                        substantial minority of the population, it seems probable that the last
                        named figure is most nearly accurate.</p>
                    <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>Nowhere in China has there developed an independent Moslem state. There have
                        occurred in Chinese history a number of revolts against the Government by
                        Moslem communities such as the Kansu Revolution in 1648, the Panthay Rise in
                        Yunnan in 1855 and 1873, and the Tungan Rebellions in Shensi and Kansu in
                        1864 to 1867 and 1895 to 1896. These rebellions were all suppressed by
                        wholesale massacres. The rebellions did not owe their origin either to
                        religious fanaticism on the part of the Moslems or to any antipathy on the
                        part of the Chinese to the practice of the Mohammedan religion but had a
                        political basis.</p>
                    <p>Although the Mohammedan population of China hold tenaciously to their
                        religion in an external sense, the doctrines of Islam sit lightly upon them.
                        They do, however, abstain from eating pork, which is so conspicuous a part
                        of the ordinary Chinese diet. Although no disabilities are placed upon
                        Mohammedans for their religion they are marked from the rest of their fellow
                        countrymen almost as clearly as if they were a separate nation. Everywhere
                        they are a distinct and self-contained portion of the population.
                        Nevertheless, individual Mohammedans have risen to prominence in Chinese
                        officialdom.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Summary and Conclusion</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is apparent from the foregoing that the adherents of Islam in China,
                        constituting as they do probably not more than two percent of the
                        population, form a majority or substantial minority bloc only in Sinkiang,
                        Kansu, Shensi and Yunnan. These adherents are largely <pb n="195"
                            xml:id="pg_195" facs="0205"/>found among populations which are
                        non-Chinese in race or culture or which were converted to Islam before they
                        were assimilated to Chinese culture. There is little prospect that the
                        Moslem population will be able to increase its political influence in
                        China.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, in as much as China ranks among the first eight Mohammedan
                        countries in the number of Moslem adherents (the others being the British
                        Empire, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, France, Turkey, Egypt, and Iran),
                        and especially in view of the fact that most of China’s Moslem population is
                        in “Free” China rather than in Japanese-occupied territory, China would seem
                        to be in a position of advantage to promote pro-United Nations sentiment
                        among other Moslem countries and communities in Asia and Africa and thus
                        combat the spread of Axis influence in the countries of the Levant.</p>
                    <p>It is suggested that consideration be given to sending an instruction to our
                        Ambassador at Chungking asking him in his discretion if a favorable
                        opportunity should arise to discuss with Chinese officialdom the question of
                        the feasibility of efforts by Chinese Moslem leaders and by Chinese
                        diplomatic representatives in Moslem countries to promote pro-United Nations
                        sentiment in the Islamic world. A draft telegram for consideration is
                            attached.<note n="9" xml:id="d167fn9">

                    <p>307. According to radio reports, there was held at Chungking on March 30 a
                        National Moslem Conference at which General Pai Chung-hsi, Chairman, urged
                        Chinese Moslems to band together in the cause of reconstruction and
                        resistance.</p>
                    <p>The idea suggests itself that the Chinese Government, by virtue of its having
                        a considerable Moslem population, might be in an advantageous position to
                        appeal to the Moslem world for support of the cause of the United Nations
                        and thus help combat the spread of Axis influence in the Near East. Chinese
                        diplomatic representatives in Mohammedan countries could probably render
                        effective service in this direction. It would be better still if such
                        efforts could be supplemented by selecting unofficial Chinese Mohammedan
                        leaders to make tours to Near Eastern countries for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>The Department would appreciate an expression of your views on this subject.
                        You may wish in your discretion to discuss it informally with officials of
                        the Chinese Government should a favorable opportunity present itself.</p>

                    <p>498. Reference Department’s 307, April 21, 6 p.m. Conference in late March
                        was of Chinese Moslem National Salvation Confederation, another loose union
                        of various Chinese Moslem organizations. Emphasis was on internal problems
                        of resistance to Japan and counteraction of Japanese efforts to win support
                        of North China Moslems. There was no formal consideration of foreign
                        relations although private disappointment was reportedly expressed that
                        Chiang Kai-shek slighted Moslem leaders in recent visit to India.<note
                            n="10" xml:id="d169fn10">Generalissimo Chiang visited India in February;
                            see <ref target="#pg_761">p. 761</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The purport of the Department’s idea has been informally discussed with a
                        number of Chinese officials. The Chinese Government is aware of advantages
                        of closer relations with Moslem countries of Near and Middle East. (See
                        Embassy’s 321, April 2, 1 p.m.,<note n="11" xml:id="d169fn11">Not
                            printed.</note> paragraph 3.) Treaties of amity were recently concluded
                        with Iran and Iraq and agreements made to exchange envoys with Egypt.
                        Nominations of envoys to all three countries is still under consideration.
                        Chinese Government is now making renewed approach to Afghanistan Government
                        through London. Relations with these countries have been based on
                        geographical and political considerations. Chinese have intentionally
                        avoided religious angle because of desire to keep this factor out of their
                        treatment of and relations with Chinese Moslems.</p>
                    <p>While anxious to promote and develop close relations with Moslem countries,
                        Chinese Government has no present intentions of further good-will missions.
                        Two such missions toured Near East and Malaya in 1938 and 1939 under
                        auspices of Moslem Federation. Study by Chinese in Egypt and Turkey and
                        pilgrimages to Mecca have been stopped by war.</p>
                    <p>The dearth of well-educated influential and politically acceptable Chinese
                        Moslems as well as travel difficulties rendered adoption of Department’s
                        suggestion impracticable. There are in fact no Chinese Moslems with suitable
                        qualifications and experience to head diplomatic missions to Moslem
                        countries. The Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs<note n="12"
                            xml:id="d169fn12">Foo Ping-sheung.</note> informed me, for example, that
                        Egypt had asked that Chinese Minister to Cairo be a Moslem but that Chinese
                        Government was unable to comply. He added that when he came to the Foreign
                        Office last summer, training of six Chinese Moslems for diplomatic service
                        was undertaken. Two of these will be assigned to Cairo and other to Turkey,
                        Iran and Iraq. He commented on the recent appointment <pb n="197"
                            xml:id="pg_197" facs="0207"/>of an American Minister to Kabul and
                        queried whether the American Government might not be able to support China’s
                        negotiations for diplomatic representation in Afghanistan.</p>

                        Communist forces, possible developments in the event of a Russo-Japanese war
                        and the economic situation. With reference to Chou’s observations on the

                        <p>I had an interesting and frank conversation yesterday with Chou En-lai,
                            official representative in Chungking of the communist party.</p>
                        <p>His estimate of the reaction to and possible developments from the
                            disintegration of resistance in Burma was in general conformity with the
                            opinion I had previously formed based on conversations with other
                            Chinese officials. He did not think that the Japanese had any intention
                            of making a major drive toward Kunming from Burma. He interpreted the
                            rapid motorization advance toward Paoshan as being primarily a foraging
                            expedition. He felt that the Chinese forces in Yunnan would be able to
                            cope with the situation.</p>
                        <p>He said that the defeat in Burma would have an adverse effect on morale
                            primarily in official quarters but did not think it would be serious.
                            Commodity speculators would no doubt take advantage of the situation
                            further to boost prices and hoarding would increase <pb n="198"
                                xml:id="pg_198" facs="0208"/>somewhat. He considered, however, that
                            these effects would be temporary. He estimated that the cessation of
                            shipments into China from Burma would not directly affect the livelihood
                            of ninety-five per cent of the people and would have little indirect
                            effect. Curtailment of motor transportation facilities in an effort to
                            conserve gasoline supplies would be the most widely felt result of the
                            severance of communications with Burma.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned reports of Japanese peace overtures to the Chungking
                            government. He said that he had not heard of them. He expressed
                            confidence that General Chiang was determined to continue resistance and
                            said that there were no elements in the government with sufficient
                            strength and influence to initiate an appeasement policy although there
                            were some elements that might be inclined to do so. I asked him what he
                            considered the strongest elements in the Kuomintang under Chiang. He
                            enumerated them as follows: (1) Tai Chi-tao, President of the
                            Examination Yuan. Tai had been quite a liberal in the early days of the
                            Kuomintang but with the passage of years had become very conservative.
                            He now had a political philosophy closely bordering on paternalistic
                            monarchy. Chiang thought highly of him and was attracted by his ideas.
                            (2) Chen Li-fu, his brother, Chen Kuo-fu (the CC clique) and Chu
                            Chia-hua (Chen is Minister of Education and Chu Chia-hua is Vice
                            President of the Control Yuan). These men have a strong influence in
                            educational and party personnel spheres. They are ultra-conservative and
                            are strong exponents of party discipline and the strengthening of party
                            influence among the people. Chu Chia-hua has fascist leanings and Chen
                            is strongly imbued with ideas of a Chinese renaissance under close
                            Kuomintang supervision. (3) Chang Chun, Chairman of Szechuan and
                            confidant of General Chiang, and the so-called Political Science group
                            of which he is a leading figure. The so-called “members” of the “group”
                            are generally Chinese officials with a conservative Chinese outlook,
                            with a certain antagonism towards what may be called the “returned
                            student” (from England and America) element. Many of the high provincial
                            officials and many returned students from Japan are adherents of the
                            group. They are not pro-Japanese however. They are pro-Chinese with a
                            strong feeling for Chinese institutions and ways of life. (4) The
                            military leaders of which Ho Ying-chin, Hu Tsung-nan and Ch’en Cheng are
                            the outstanding. General Ho, as minister of War and Chief of Staff, has
                            a strong position in army administration. There is not the suspicion
                            between General Ho and General Chiang that is mentioned at times.
                            General Hu is in direct or indirect command of the largest, best trained
                            and best equipped army in China—approximately 440,000 men. His command
                            extends from Loyang in Honan, through Sian in Shensi, and then northward
                            to Lanchow in Kansu. He has direct access to General Chiang but his
                            relations with General Ho are on an easy basis. <pb n="199"
                                xml:id="pg_199" facs="0209"/>General Ch’en is commander of the
                            important 6th War Area (Hupeh province) and is also very close to
                            General Chiang. (5) The Soong family group. The antagonism between Kung
                            and T. V. Soong weakens the group but Kung is dominant in the financial

                            secret service organization in the country. He is close to General
                            Chiang and exercises a strong influence through his extensive police
                            organization said to number at least 40,000 men.</p>
                        <p>There are of course other elements but the foregoing constitute the
                            strongest elements in the Kuomintang—the controlling elements. Chou said
                            that none of them are animated by any well defined political philosophy
                            or concepts. Their primary objective is to maintain the Kuomintang in
                            control and, in so far as consistent with that objective, to increase
                            their own influence within the Kuomintang.</p>
                        <p>Chou said that the “quarantine” of the Communist forces by Hu Tsung-nan’s
                            armies continued to be very effective. I asked him what he thought would
                            be the developments in the northwest area in the event of a
                            Russo-Japanese war. He said that he did not anticipate an early outbreak
                            of such hostilities. He expressed fear that, if they did occur, the
                            Chinese Government forces would not take advantage of the situation to
                            start offensive operations in the north. He said that the Communist
                            forces, numbering about a half million men, would request the National
                            Government for equipment to undertake such an offensive. If this request
                            were refused (he thought it would be), request would be made for small
                            arms and ammunition for active guerilla operations in the north and
                            northeast. Upon the refusal of this request (which he considered likely)
                            the Government would be asked to agree to the Communist forces receiving
                            military supplies from Russia. He said that such a request would place
                            the National Government in an embarrassing position because it would not
                            wish to agree—would probably not agree—but would find it very difficult
                            to explain its position to the other immediately interested United
                            Nations.</p>
                        <p>Chou said that, while an attitude of “wait and see” might be advocated by
                            some Chinese officials, he felt that there was little actual “defeatism”
                            in China and that by and large there was confidence in victory over
                            Japan. He said the economic-financial situation was the most serious
                            problem in unoccupied China; that it did more to depress morale than
                            anything else, and that the Government should actively and immediately
                            concern itself with ameliorative measures. He is an advocate of
                            increasing the production of agricultural and other consumption goods as
                            rapidly as possible without special regard for cost. He suggests land
                            reform and reclamation and full support of industrial cooperatives as
                            means of accomplishing these ends.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit, as being of
                        possible interest to the Department as a reflection of relations between the
                        Kuomintang and the Chinese Communists, and as an example of a cruder type of
                        Kuomintang propaganda, a recent copy of a semi-monthly paper, the <hi
                            rend="italic">Liang Hsin Hua</hi> (roughly translatable as “Honest
                        Talk”).</p>
                    <p>The chief object of this paper, judging from the emphasis on space and
                        position, is propaganda against the Chinese Communist Party. Exactly the
                        same terms of opprobrium are used for the Wang Ching-wei and Communist
                        Border Region governments—both being referred to as <hi rend="italic"
                            >wei</hi> (bogus or unauthorized)—but at least half of the leading
                        articles, news items and total space of the paper are devoted to the
                        Communists, while the remaining half is divided between the Wang Ching-wei
                        and other puppet regimes, the Japanese, and general news, such as a story of
                        the plight of “cultural workers” in Shanghai after December 8.</p>
                    <p>Translations of three of the leading articles of this issue are
                            enclosed.<note n="14" xml:id="d171fn14">Not printed.</note> Briefly: the
                        first urges extension of National Mobilization to and the abolition of the
                        special status of the Border Area (where mobilization is in fact already far
                        more complete that [<hi rend="italic">than</hi>] it has ever been in
                        Kuomintang controlled China); the second “exposes” the Communist system of
                        local government by councils of family heads; the third describes the
                        “pitiful condition of the farmers under the oppression of the
                        Communists”.</p>
                    <p>It is significant that the vision of the paper does not seem to reach beyond
                        China. Although the Chinese Communists are damned, nothing is said of
                        Russia. Japan is called a barbarous enemy, but only for its war on China.
                        Despite the date of the paper—May 15, 1942—there is no mention of a world
                        struggle against aggression, of China’s part in it, or of the many nations
                        united together with China.</p>
                    <p>It is well known that the press in China is rigidly controlled. There are
                        both political and military censorships—by the Central Publicity Board of
                        the Kuomintang and the Military Affairs Commission. In addition, all
                        newspapers must be registered with the Ministry of Interior, and all
                        publications sold in the city of Chungking must have the approval of the
                        Municipal Government. In <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0211"/>Chungking
                        the authorities make a pretense of “freedom of the press”—probably for the
                        impression on foreigners—but deleted or partially censored editorials are
                        not uncommon and outright criticism of the government or party almost
                        unknown. Outside of Chungking the situation is reported to be worse. One
                        effect of this control is to suppress much news; another is to discourage
                        comment on domestic issues, leading to the often remarked unhealthy tendency
                        to devote editorial comment to foreign affairs and, often, to criticism of
                        China’s allies. The “prize exhibit” of this freedom of the press in
                        Chungking is the continuance in publication of the Communist supported <hi
                            rend="italic">Hsin Hua Jih Pao</hi>. But the control is so close that
                        this paper rarely comments on internal affairs and, especially during the
                        past few months, has gone for weeks at a time without any editorials at all.
                        In view of its emasculated character, it is rather amusing that samples of
                        it should have been included in a recent exhibit of “enemy propaganda” shown
                        to students of the Central Training Corps, a school for party workers near
                        Chungking.</p>
                    <p>Other indications of the closeness of this press control are the facts that
                        Communist publications from the Border Area are not permitted to come into
                        Kuomintang controlled areas, and that no other Communist publication or
                        propaganda material has come to the attention of the members of this
                        Embassy.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">Liang Hsin Hua</hi> is hawked openly on the ferry
                        boats, streets and other public places and has a wide circulation. It bears
                        a Ministry of Interior registration number and states that it is registered
                        with the Post Office as a newspaper. But the names of its editors or
                        publishers are not published and cannot be ascertained. Inquiries by the
                        Communist representatives have received the answer that it is not actually
                        registered, that the Kuomintang authorities know nothing as to its
                        publishers, and that it is in fact an illegal publication. Efforts by the
                        Embassy to obtain a mail subscription through the address given were
                        unsuccessful.</p>
                    <p>Under the conditions of press control described above, the assertion that
                        this paper is published and sold without the knowledge and approval of the
                        Kuomintang is absurd. The Communist representatives claim to have knowledge
                        that it is published under the direct supervision of the Vice Minister of
                        Publicity, Pan Kung-chan. Whether or not this is a fact, it is significant
                        that the man in the street takes for granted that it is an officially
                        inspired Kuomintang publication.</p>

                        brief description of the chief propaganda, psychological warfare and morale
                        agencies operating in Free China”.</p>

                    <p>It is assumed that this refers to Chinese agencies having headquarters in
                        Free China but possibly also carrying on work in occupied territories or
                        abroad.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, I have made no attempt to describe foreign propaganda efforts in
                        China—now being conducted openly and officially (with Chinese cooperation)
                        by American, British and Russian agencies, and possibly (but necessarily
                        very much under cover) by the Axis countries. I have also omitted Chinese
                        Communist activity which, outside of the Special Border Area in North Shensi
                        and some of the North China guerrilla districts, is extremely limited and
                        must be conducted in secrecy.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The situation as regards work of propaganda type is extremely complex.
                        Organizations and agencies doing (or intended to do) propaganda,
                        psychological warfare, or morale work are numerous and redundant. There are
                        no comprehensive published reports of their work or organizational set-up.
                        And the general Chinese attitude, especially since most of the organizations
                        involved belong to either the Army or the Party, is one of secrecy and
                        distrust of foreign inquisitiveness.</p>
                    <p>Mr. F. M. Fisher of the Foreign Information Service of the United States,
                        attached to this Embassy, has remarked that although the subject is one in
                        which he has been interested since coming to Chungking as a press
                        correspondent eighteen months ago—and especially so during the past six
                        months that he has been engaged in the promotion of American propaganda and
                        psychological warfare work in China—he has been unable to get from the
                        Chinese, with whom he must coordinate his own work, any clear idea of the
                        scope, organization and activity of their agencies in this field.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Background</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>A description of Chinese propaganda and related work requires as background a
                        brief consideration of recent political history and the present political,
                        social and economic situation in China.</p>
                    <p>The first of these is the Kuomintang dictatorship. This has given the party a
                        monopoly of all propaganda, even within the Army. Education is frankly
                        identified with propaganda.<note n="*" xml:id="d174fn3">The Ministry of
                            Education might with justification be called the most important and
                            extensive propaganda agency. This is borne out in numerous public
                            statements such as the recent broadcast by the Minister of Education,
                            Ch’en Li-fu, to the occupied territory emphasizing the importance of
                            “San Min Chu I education” of children and youth. The Ministry does not
                            seem to be directly within the field of this survey but its own concept
                            of its mission, its strong political and nationalistic character, and
                            its influence, through selection of textbooks and control of primary,
                            secondary, and to a slightly lesser extent of higher education, should
                            be noted. [Footnote in the original.]</note> The press is controlled.
                            <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0214"/>All propaganda takes on a
                        political character, and the strengthening and perpetuation of the
                        Kuomintang’s position becomes one of its primary objectives.</p>
                    <p>A second, but related, factor is the situation growing out of the break-down
                        of the “united front”. The truce with the Chinese Communists and other
                        left-wing elements, made after the Sian incident at the end of 1936, became
                        genuine and apparently whole-hearted cooperation in the early stage of the
                        war with Japan. That conflict provided a powerful rallying force. There was
                        real effort to arouse and unite the people, and great activity in
                        propagandizing and organizing guerrilla operations in the areas close to and
                        under Japanese occupation. In this spontaneous outburst of enthusiastic war
                        work, the country’s leading writers and artists (most of them left-wing) and
                        the Communists took a major part. Many people—even within the present
                        government—look back on this period as that of the government’s greatest
                        efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>For reasons which need not be discussed in detail here, there was a reaction
                        which dates roughly from the moving of the government away from Hankow in
                        the Fall of 1938. The Kuomintang apparently became jealous of the growing
                        influence of the Communists and subjected them and the left-wing to a
                        growing repression which, culminating in the clash with the New Fourth Army,
                        has led to the present situation of suspicion and near hostilities. The
                        effect was to kill much of the active, creative propaganda work which was
                        being done and to give Kuomintang propaganda a strong anti-Communist
                            bias.<note n="†" xml:id="d174fn4">See, for instance, the Embassy’s
                            despatch no. 478 of June 22, 1942, on the subject: “Anti-Communist
                            Propaganda”. [Footnote in the original.]</note> To certain sections of
                        the Party, combatting Communism became an important, if not the most
                        important, part of propaganda work. The vitality and vigor of anti-Japanese
                        propaganda and psychological warfare activity has declined since this
                        time.</p>
                    <p>A third factor is the effect of general war-weariness and economic
                        difficulties. After five years of war there has come an inevitable letdown
                        of morale and enthusiasm. The capital is now located far from the almost
                        inactive fighting fronts. Communication and transportation are extremely
                        difficult. Supplies are difficult to obtain—even paper and printing present
                        great problems. Inflation has brought a tremendous increase in costs. The
                        result is that many organizations, which for a time did more or less
                        effective work, have greatly reduced their activity or become moribund.</p>
                    <p>A recent development greatly affecting propaganda work among Chinese in the
                        occupied areas and abroad was the seizure by the Japanese in December, 1941,
                        of the foreign settlements at Shanghai and Tientsin and the capture of Hong
                        Kong and “south sea” cities. <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0215"/>In all
                        of these places there was a Kuomintang subsidized press and extensive
                        propaganda and secret service activity, some of which might be considered a
                        psychological warfare against the Japanese and their puppets. Immediately
                        after occupation by the Japanese, the persons engaged in this work were
                        arrested or forced to flee. As a result, work in the occupied areas is
                        admittedly at an almost complete standstill.</p>
                    <p>A fifth factor, mentioned because it adds to the difficulty of a clear
                        survey, is the Chinese tendency to multiply organizations without limiting
                        their functions or unifying their control. We find that almost every
                        department in the government and major Party organization has its own
                        propaganda or publicity branch. And despite the original complexity of the
                        Government-Party structure, there has been a tendency, as the war progressed
                        and new situations arose, to superimpose on the existing framework new and
                        often vaguely defined organizations. For instance, the recently established
                        National General Mobilization Council has a “Culture Branch”, presumably to
                        initiate and coordinate propaganda in support of the national mobilization
                        effort. The steady bureaucratic growth seems, in many cases, to have
                        increased confusion, divided responsibility and reduced initiative and
                        effectiveness.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Considering only the main propaganda agencies, we find the field divided,
                        generally speaking, among four organizations: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                the country but its special sphere is the civilian population in the

                                its foreign department it also engages in propaganda abroad and
                                controls news going-out of China. Its propaganda objectives are
                                governed by the fact that it is strictly a Kuomintang organization
                                and there are indications that it does not very effectively reach
                                the great uneducated mass of the people, especially the rural
                                masses.</p>

                                and to combat any influence of Japanese puppet and non-Kuomintang
                                elements. Its work has been greatly reduced by the course of the

                        Chou En-lai and who are believed to state intelligently the Chinese
                        Communist point of view.</p>
                    <p>These informants claim that the Chinese Communists retain considerable
                        strength and, contrary to Central Government reports, are continuing
                        actively to fight the Japanese: they accuse the Central Government itself of
                        deliberately avoiding such conflict. They attach <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207"
                            facs="0217"/>importance to pro-German tendencies of the present Chinese
                        regime—which they feel have been strengthened by spectacular German military
                        successes—and interpret the present clamor in China to “defeat Japan first”
                        as a hope that such action might reduce pressure on Germany. Incidentally,
                        they criticize the morale of Chinese military officers, American propaganda
                        in China (as contributing to Chinese complacence regarding their part in the
                        war), and American and British propaganda generally (for lack of
                        imaginative, democratic appeal to the people of Germany and Japan).</p>
                    <p>As for the statement that the Central Government is not fighting the
                        Japanese: the Embassy has repeatedly reported that neither the Communists
                        nor Central Government are actively so engaged. There is undoubtedly
                        admiration, especially in military and more reactionary Kuomintang circles,
                        of German efficiency, organization and military might; but there does not
                        appear to be justification for the statement that the present Chinese regime
                        hopes for a German victory over Russia. Corruption among Chinese officers
                        and large scale engagement in trade in areas adjacent to the unoccupied
                        areas is unfortunately, by Chinese admission, a common occurrence. The
                        Embassy has on several occasions called attention to the questionable
                        advisability of the over-extravagant propaganda regarding China which has
                        been coming from America.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The information contained in this memorandum is derived from two persons
                            close to General Chou En-lai and the Communist headquarters here in
                            Chungking.</p>
                        <p>My informants stated that the strength of the Eighteenth Group Army
                            (former Eighth Route) is between 500,000 and 600,000. Quoting a foreign
                            source, they said that there are an estimated one million rifles in the
                            Communist areas in the north. They maintained that Communist strength in
                            North China has spread to a greater extent than is generally realized;
                            for example, there is only one district in Shantung which remains under
                            Central Government control. So-called Border Districts have been
                            established by the Communists in <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0218"
                            />several areas north of the Yangtze. One is in southern Shantung and
                            northern Kiangsu. It is there that the Eighteenth Group Army and New
                            Fourth Army are in contact. The Communists are organized even on Hainan
                            Island, my informants stated.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Central Government charges that the Communist forces have
                            been avoiding conflict with the Japanese, they maintained that fighting
                            between the Communists and the Japanese continues and that Tso Chuan,
                            Vice Chief of Staff of the Eighteenth Group Army, was killed in an
                            engagement in southeastern Shansi late in May. The Central Government
                            authorities refused permission, my informants declared, for the holding
                            of a memorial meeting for Tso Chuan, presumably because of a desire to
                            prevent publicity of the Eighteenth Group Army’s continued activity
                            against the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>General Chou has declared, according to my informants, that in the event
                            of a Russo-Japanese war he anticipated orders being issued by the
                            Central Government to the Eighteenth Group Army to launch an offensive
                            directed at Manchuria. If this develops, he would expect the Communists
                            to ask for adequate arms to carry out the directive and the Central
                            Government to refuse the request. He would then look for a request for
                            at least small arms and ammunition, which he would also expect to be
                            refused. Finally, the Eighteenth Group Army would appeal to the United
                            States, the Soviet Union and Great Britain for the equipment necessary
                            to undertake the offensive.</p>
                        <p>Commenting upon the Central Government’s reluctance to expend its
                            strength against the Japanese, my informants stated that the Government
                            felt that there was no reason for China to exert itself when Great
                            Britain, which was receiving such vast quantities of American lend-lease
                            material, was doing so little. Therefore, practically no resistance was
                            offered to the recent Japanese incursions into Chekiang and Kiangsi. The
                            Generalissimo was quoted as having stated to General Pai Chung-hsi that
                            China’s policy must be one of conserving its strength.</p>
                        <p>My informants were critical of the extravagant praise in the American
                            press of Chinese resistance, especially the parallels drawn between
                            Chinese and Russian resistance. They said that American correspondents
                            who had originally been responsible in a large measure for the
                            exaggeration, out of motives of friendship for China, admitted that they
                            had been at fault but could not rectify their error without causing an
                            even more undesirable reaction in the United States. Even many Chinese
                            are amused by American eulogies of China’s military exploits, they
                            stated. They asked if Americans who really mattered in the United States
                            realized the true state of affairs in China.</p>
                        <p>There exists a natural ideological affinity between the regime now in
                            power in China and the Nazis, my informants stated. Within the <pb
                                n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0219"/>Central Government there is a
                            pronounced admiration of the Nazis which has been augmented by the
                            conspicuous success of German arms. The only Chungking Germans confined
                            to a concentration camp are three German Jews; the Nazi Germans move
                            about freely. Sons of Chungking Chinese families were said still to be
                            working as student apprentices in German factories.</p>
                        <p>An interesting sidelight was thrown on the Chinese slogan of “Defeat
                            Japan First”. It was suggested that concentration by the United Nations
                            on the defeat of Japan would probably result in lightening the pressure
                            on Germany and might even contribute to a German victory over the Soviet
                            Union. Such a development would not be unwelcome to the regime in power
                            in Chungking.</p>
                        <p>My informants declared that the influence of the von Falkenhausen group
                            of German advisers<note n="22" xml:id="d175fn22">General von
                                Falkenhausen and his mission were recalled by Adolf Hitler, German
                                Chief of State, Führer, and Chancellor.</note> (which returned to
                            Germany in 1938) on the Chinese Army has been great. Many of the Chinese
                            officers now of the grade of colonel and lieutenant colonel are products
                            of von Falkenhausen’s training. They are professionally able and are
                            strongly pro-German. Von Falkenhausen and his officers maintained
                            excellent relations with the Chinese officers whom they trained. I was
                            interested in the comment that von Falkenhausen did not teach the most
                            up-to-date German military technique because he did not himself know
                            that technique. He was a military man of the old German school, he
                            ignored and was contemptuous of political indoctrination and guerrilla
                            warfare and maintained that the only training necessary was professional
                            military training. This theory well suited the Generalissimo who
                            arranged for his own political indoctrination, however undynamic it
                            was.</p>
                        <p>Captain Stinnes,<note n="23" xml:id="d175fn23">Son of the German
                                industrialist Hugo Stinnes, who did not return to Germany.</note> my
                            informants said, was still alive. He has a close German friend here with
                            whom he has communicated, they stated, and he has also communicated with
                            the Generalissimo. They declared that there is no question of Stinnes’s
                            loyalty to General Chiang and that he has with Germans in Tokyo acted as
                            a channel for messages from the Japanese to the Generalissimo. Stinnes
                            was said to be close to Tai Li.</p>
                        <p>The experience of the Russian advisers was an unhappy one, according to
                            my informants. They were insulated at their posts from contact with
                            practically everyone but their Chinese liaison officers. It was remarked
                            with laughter that the Chinese claimed that the Russians were seeking to
                            learn the lessons taught by von Falkenhausen.</p>
                        <p>The suggestion advanced by the American Under Secretary of State that
                            there be a long period of cooling-off and consultation between <pb
                                n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0220"/>the termination of the war and
                            the waiting of peace terms was mentioned with warm approval. My
                            informants said that the peace conference must not be held in Europe;
                            the hatreds are too great. Europe, they declared, must be unified
                            despite the probable intensification of national feeling as a result of
                            the war. The Netherlands was mentioned as a case in point. The Dutch
                            have not been an intensely nationalistic people, but at the close of the
                            war my informants expected to see a fierce, stubborn Dutch nationalism
                            which would resist the unification of Europe. They then contrasted
                                Beaverbrook’s<note n="24" xml:id="d175fn24">Lord Beaverbrook,
                                British newspaper publisher.</note> advocacy of hate of every German

                            discrimination between the Nazi regime and the German people. This
                            revealed, they remarked, the sterile, negative British program of
                            political warfare and the constructive, positive Russian program.
                            British propaganda tells the German people that their leaders are lying
                            to them; this the German people rather suspect anyway; British
                            propaganda does not offer the German people anything better than a
                            return to post-Versailles conditions, which were for the German people
                            intolerable.</p>
                        <p>The American propaganda line directed at Japan was also criticized. The
                            propaganda was seen as seeking to persuade the Japanese people that the
                            present political situation in Japan represents a reestablishment of the
                            Shogunate and that they should bring about a restoration of the
                            Emperor’s power. My informants viewed this propaganda as reactionary and
                            at variance with the American concept of this being a people’s war. A
                            democratic revolutionary appeal to the Japanese masses they considered
                            to be a sounder line, pointing to Spain as an example of a country which
                            was generally regarded as the most religious and reactionary in Europe
                            responding to a prospect of revolutionary liberation.</p>
                        <p>Of several Chinese personalities, my informants first commented on Pai
                            Chung-hsi, saying that he is becoming increasingly identified with the
                            Central Government; he is a general without an army, therefore in a
                            dependent position. Shang Chen, they said, has little influence and what
                            he does enjoy is due to the fact that he knows English. They described
                            Wang Peng-sheng, chief of the International Problems Investigation
                            Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission (and a man who appears to
                            exert considerable influence on foreign policy) as a pseudo-expert.
                            Although he is supposed to speak with authority regarding Japanese
                            affairs, he was said to have made several glaringly inaccurate
                            predictions.</p>
                        <p>Graft and smuggling by Chinese military officers is practically
                            un-preventable, according to my informants, because of the low salary
                                <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0221"/>scale in the Army. By way
                            of illustrating the low salaries paid officers, they told a current
                            Chungking story. A Major General wished to take a certain local beauty
                            as wife. He approached the young lady’s mother, asking her daughter’s
                            hand in marriage. The mother was said to have replied, “Why I even told
                            a truck driver that he couldn’t have her; do you think I would marry her
                            to a Major General!”</p>

                    <p>888. National Government on July 27 announced list of the 240 members of the
                        Third People’s Political Council, 105 of whom were elected by various
                        provincial and municipal assemblies, 59 jointly nominated by provincial
                        governments and provincial Kuomintang headquarters, 8 selected from Mongols
                        and Tibetans, 8 from overseas Chinese and 60 appointed by the Supreme
                        National Defense Council from Chinese leaders in various professions.
                        Seventeen provinces represented in new Council. Communist Party represented
                        by 6 members, including Mao Tse-tung but attendance unlikely.</p>
                    <p>The People’s Political Council is not a legislative body and its meetings

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose a memorandum
                        prepared by Mr. Vincent, Counselor of Embassy, on the subject of “The
                        Chinese National (Kuomintang) Government; its Leadership and Influential
                        Elements”. His analysis or diagnosis of Kuomintang leadership is the result
                        of his contacts with and observation of officials in Chungking over the past
                        year. As he states, the subject does not lend itself to precise treatment.
                        The memorandum, in view of the subject matter, is necessarily more
                        suggestive and speculative than factual <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212"
                            facs="0222"/>but it furnishes a valuable background and guide to
                        interpretation of Kuomintang attitudes and actions present and future and as
                        such should prove useful to the Embassy and the Department.</p>

                        <p>As an aid to an understanding and interpretation not only of day to day
                            occurrences and attitudes with regard to China’s participation in the
                            war but also of what may be expected from the Chinese Government in the
                            long view with regard to prosecution of the war and plans for the peace,
                            I have attempted the following analysis of the leadership and
                            influential elements in the Kuomintang or National Government.</p>
                        <p>The Kuomintang controls the Government. There is no active opposition.
                            But the Kuomintang is a congeries of conservative political cliques
                            whose only common denominator and common objective is desire to maintain
                            the Kuomintang in control of the Government. Within the party
                            individuals and elements manoeuver to maintain or increase their
                            influence. The fact that personalities are more prominent than
                            principles in influencing and deciding policy makes for difficulty in an
                            analysis of the Party leadership. Broad generalizations on the basis of
                            similarities or “isms” would be misleading.</p>
                        <p>Chiang Kai-shek is the undisputed leader of the National Government and
                            of the Kuomintang (National People’s Party). He is President of the
                            Executive Yuan (Premier); he is Commander in Chief of the Army; and he
                            is Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. He is
                            supreme in the Government, in the Army, and in the Party.<note n="27"
                                xml:id="d177fn1">Marginal notation: “Also at beginning of war was
                                made ‘Tsung-tsai’, Director General of the K. M. T., having all the
                                rights formerly enjoyed by Sun Yat-sen.”</note> The Chairman or
                            President of the National Government, Lin Sen, is an elder statesman of
                            no appreciable influence. Chiang’s leadership is undisputed and supreme
                            but it does not follow that it is absolute. He is not a dictator. His
                            leadership is subject to modifications by influential elements within
                            the Party and the Government. The political elements which he leads are
                            held together by the personal force and political acumen which he
                            exercises.</p>
                        <p>In the years since the establishment of the National (Kuomintang)
                            Government at Nanking in 1927, the Kuomintang has become increasingly
                                <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0223"/>conservative, selfishly as
                            much as politically conservative; in short, “preservative”. The
                            patriotic appeal to resistance to Japan has in recent years been
                            effectively used as a substitute for what should have been an earlier
                            appeal of ideas, ideals, and constructive reform. Already at the
                            outbreak of hostilities with the Japanese in 1937, the Kuomintang was
                            suffering from a want of any applied idealism in its policies and
                            undertakings. Lip service was given to the Three Principles of Dr. Sun
                            Yat-sen but principal attention was directed toward the eradication of
                            dissident political and military groups. The Party had become a sterile
                            bureaucracy depending upon the monied interests and the military for its
                            support. Japanese aggression united the people in a wave of patriotism,
                            relatively strong for China, and in support of the Government’s policy
                            of resistance. Even the communists and other minor parties joined in
                            supporting the Government for a time. This support was subsequently
                            rejected by the Kuomintang controlled Government when, in 1939, it
                            ceased to be hard pressed by the Japanese; and today the communists are
                            virtually outlawed and other dissident elements are suppressed through
                            control of the press and through the more direct method of secret
                            service espionage and arrest. By these methods new blood, new thought,
                            and new inspiration have been discouraged—prevented—from coming into the
                            Party with the resultant bureaucratic sterility that now characterizes
                            the Kuomintang Government.</p>
                        <p>The influential personalities and elements that compose and control the
                            Kuomintang under Chiang are described as a “congeries” because their
                            association together in the Kuomintang is fortuitous and expedient. They
                            are not held together by ideal or principle. They are held together by a
                            common desire for self-preservation, by the external pressure of
                            Japanese aggression and by the personality of the Generalissimo. They
                            are grouped together and described as “cliques” because of the strong
                            personal character of the groupings. Personal loyalties play a larger
                            role in determining the composition and relations of the groups than do
                            political or social concepts. The term “conservative” in describing this
                            congeries of cliques is employed in a generic rather than a political
                            sense; that is, they are bent on conserving what they have, which is
                            control of the Government of China.</p>
                        <p>Most intelligent Chinese are intellectual liberals, mildly predisposed
                            toward social liberalism but readily discouraged by racial and mass
                            inertia. Many of the members of the Kuomintang were men of that type.
                            The Kuomintang’s failure to solve any of the major economic and social
                            problems of China, once it had formed a Government at Nanking in 1927,
                            was caused by a strong desire to utilize the most immediate means for
                            establishing and maintaining itself in power. Chiang Kai-shek, after
                            sweeping north to the Yangtze on a revolutionary <pb n="214"
                                xml:id="pg_214" facs="0224"/>program, made his peace in Shanghai
                            with the bankers and landlords and took into his fold such reactionary
                            warlords as he could attract to his camp. Thereafter commenced the long
                            battle to subdue the communists and liquidate non-cooperative military
                            and political elements. The Kuomintang’s failure to effect reform became
                            as much the cause as the result of its conservatism. Faced with a lack
                            of popular enthusiasm and support because of its failure to provide
                            solutions for the pressing social and economic problems, the party
                            leadership has had perforce to concentrate on conserving its position
                            against a potential—a probable—translation of this lack of enthusiasm
                            into actual opposition. Hence the adoption of repressive measures to
                            control and eradicate opposition; to enforce party discipline and
                            inculcate through educational and training systems loyalty to so-called
                            party ideals. “Party tutelage”, the professed prelude to the institution
                            of a democratic system, has become an end in itself rather than a means
                            toward the end of putting into effect Dr. Sun’s ideal of socially and
                            economically democratic government. Political unity, held out as a
                            prerequisite to the accomplishment of social reform and the institution
                            of democratic government, has been perverted into a means of achieving a
                            high degree of centralized bureaucratic control. Japanese aggression has
                            been both an aid and an excuse for this tendency which was all too
                            apparent, however, even prior to 1937.</p>
                        <p>(The foregoing general remarks regarding the character of the Kuomintang
                            are made to indicate its position in the internal administration of the
                            country. They are in no sense meant to disparage the role which the
                            Kuomintang has played in leading and maintaining for five years
                            resistance to Japan. It merits and has received high praise for its
                            steadfast pursuit of the policy of resistance—not only physical
                            resistance but resistance against a natural or racial tendency to seek
                            compromise terms. It has also merited support in far greater degree than
                            it has been given, for I think it will be generally agreed now that real
                            and substantial aid to the Chinese forces during the years 1937–40 would
                            have been sound policy. It is ironical, now that we are willingly
                            committed to all practical assistance to China, that transportation
                            difficulties prevent material support from reaching China in
                            consequential volume.)</p>
                        <p>Personalities rather than ideas, as I have stated above, are the
                            strongest influence in the Kuomintang Government. In any enumeration of
                            the persons under Chiang who are credited with being the most
                            influential—influential not only from the standpoint of their position
                            within the Government or Party but from the standpoint of their
                            relations and influence with the Generalissimo—five names usually stand
                            out. They are: Dr. H. H. Kung, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and
                            Minister of Finance; Dr. Chen Li-fu, Minister <pb n="215"
                                xml:id="pg_215" facs="0225"/>of Education who, with his no less
                            influential brother, Chen Kuo-fu, heads the “C–C” clique; General Chang
                            Chun, Chairman of the Szechuan Provincial Government and leader of the
                            Cheng Hsueh Hsi (Political Science Society); General Ho Ying-chin, Chief
                            of Staff and Minister of Military Administration; and General Tai Li,
                            head of the powerful military secret police with the title of Director
                            of the Statistical and Investigation Office of the Military Affairs
                            Commission. In varying degrees, these men are important in their own
                            right, as outstanding members of groups and as leaders of powerful
                            organizations. There are of course the names of many officials that
                            could be added to the list, officials who are associated with the five
                            officials mentioned above or who have independent positions of influence
                            but on a lower plane than those mentioned. Some of the more important of
                            these are: Tai Chi-tao, President of the Examination Yuan, Chu Chia-hua,
                            Vice President of the Examination Yuan; Dr. Sun Fo, President of the
                            Legislative Yuan; Wang Shih-chieh, Minister of Information and
                            Publicity; Wong Wen-hao, Minister of Economics; Hsu Kan, Minister of
                            Food; Dr. Wong Chung-hui, Secretary General of the National Defense
                            Council; General Wu Teh-chen, Secretary General of the Kuomintang
                            Central Executive Committee; General Ho Yao-tsu, head of the
                            Generalissimo’s personal or household Secretariate or Aide-de-Camp
                            organization (Shih Tsung Shih); Generals Hu Tsung-nan and Chen Ch’eng,
                            commanders of two of the most powerful armies, “Whangpoa Cadets”, and
                            favorites of the Generalissimo; and Generals Pai Chung-hsi and Li
                            Tsung-jen, leaders of the Kwangsi group. The place and influence of the
                            foregoing will be the subject of treatment in connection with the
                            following discussion of the position and role of the five outstanding
                            leaders.</p>
                        <p>Dr. H. H. Kung is the dominant figure in Chinese finance. For ten years
                            he has been Minister of Finance, or, as it is sometimes put, the
                            “obliging compradore” for his brother-in-law, Chiang Kai-shek, a
                            circumstance which has insured his continuation in office against
                            opposition and charges of incompetence. He has faithfully administered
                            the finances of the country in a manner to meet the financial needs of
                            the Generalissimo which has generally meant that he has administered
                            them in a manner having little regard for sound financial practice
                            according to Western standards. The insistence of the other
                            brother-in-law, T. V. Soong, upon administration of the finances along
                            relatively modern and sound lines was largely responsible for his
                            “retirement” from office in favor of Kung. It is in fact a question
                            whether Kung, considering the vastness of the country, general
                            governmental administrative inefficiency, and difficulties imposed by
                            Japanese aggression, has not carried on about as well as could be
                            expected; whether a more competent Minister, from the western point <pb
                                n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0226"/>of view, would not have
                            succumbed where Kung has at least staved off financial collapse. Anyway,
                            Chiang Kai-shek seems to be satisfied, which is sufficient to quiet
                            opposition to Kung.</p>
                        <p>Kung has in a measure the support of the banking and landed interests in
                            the country primarily because he has avoided measures which might
                            antagonize them. He espouses no radical social program that is contrary
                            to their interests. However, his plans for government monopolies and
                            socialization of certain industries arouse suspicion among business
                            interests, and the gravity of currency inflation is beginning to
                            frighten financial interests. There are indications that landed and
                            banking interests, which gave their support to the Kuomintang in 1927,
                            are cooling toward the Party, and might be persuaded to withdraw their
                            support if they were not frightened of the consequences of doing so;
                            that is, if they knew where they could safely transfer their
                            support.</p>
                        <p>In the course of his ten years in office, Kung has been able to establish
                            for himself a loose following among younger officials in the Government
                            and to some extent among field officers of the Army who look to him for
                            special financial assistance. This has been partially due to patronage,
                            partially due to a certain feeling of attachment which the genial
                            descendant of Confucius inspires among associates, and partially to a
                            kind of negative or reflex feeling that, in comparison with many of the
                            party leaders, he represents a relatively liberal point of view. He has
                            been described as the “political tent” under which those who find or
                            desire no place in the ranks of the political cliques find shelter.</p>
                        <p>In an ill-defined way, Kung may be said to be the leader of the American
                            returned student (“Christian”, “YMCA”, “modern”) type of Chinese; of
                            those Chinese with a “western” as distinguished from an “eastern”
                            outlook; of those Chinese who advocate cooperation with America and
                            England. This is a leadership which he shares with the Soong family. In
                            this position, as in his position as manager of the nation’s finances,
                            he faces strong potential competition from his brother-in-law, T. V.
                            Soong. There are many Chinese who look upon Soong as the “white hope” of
                            a reconstructed “modern” China. But the competition between the two is a
                            matter which one feels can be managed within “the family”. Madame Chiang
                            and Madame Kung are believed quite capable of handling the situation in
                            addition to their “task” of exerting considerable influence on
                            government policy, especially foreign and financial. The Soong family
                            is, through T. V. Soong, in charge of foreign relations, and through
                            Kung, in control of finances. Chiang’s supreme position assures this and
                            also assures that there will be no open breach in the “clan” front. The
                            clan is the focal point and chief support of those Chinese with <pb
                                n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0227"/>western or Anglo-American
                            ideals and sympathies. Chiang’s dominant position, his background and
                            outlook enable him to maintain an equilibrium and to enforce cooperation
                            between this “western” group and the group which may be loosely
                            described as “eastern” in its outlook and ideals. He is matrimonially
                            and in a sense politically allied to the former but he is
                            temperamentally in the latter camp.</p>
                        <p>At this point it seems appropriate to insert a brief mention of Dr. Sun
                            Fo, son of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and Madame Sun, wife [<hi rend="italic"
                                >widow</hi>] of Dr. Sun and sister of Mme. Chiang and Mme. Kung. Sun
                            Fo is President of the Legislative Yuan (the Legislative Yuan does not
                            legislate; it simply puts into legislative form decisions of the party).
                            He is not a man of ability and his influence, which is limited, is
                            dependent entirely upon the fact of his being the only son of Sun
                            Yat-sen. He endeavors, largely through speech making, to create for
                            himself the position of leader of a liberal wing of the Party but with
                            no marked success. He has few retainers of prominence in the Government,
                            the outstanding one being Foo Ping-sheung, Political Vice Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs. Madame Sun Yat-sen is now in Chungking only by force of
                            circumstances. She maintained her residence in Hong Kong until forced to
                            leave after the Japanese attack on the island. Her name means much to
                            the radical and younger elements in and out of the Party but she lacks
                            the force actually to assume a position of leadership. She is vaguely,
                            idealistically, and quietly radical. She is not active in politics.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Chen Li-fu, Minister of Education, is, with his elder brother, Chen
                            Kuo-fu, the leader of the very influential “C–C” clique. Chen Kuo-fu is
                            head of the Central Broadcasting Administration and is Chief of the
                            Personnel Section of the Generalissimo’s private Secretariate. Between
                            them, the Chen brothers are in virtual control of education and
                            propaganda. With their adherents they hold twenty-three places on the
                            Central Executive Committee (the highest organ of the Party) which is
                            the largest and most powerful block in the Committee. The “C–C” is in
                            fact the strongest and most influential element in the Kuomintang.
                            Notable adherents to the clique are Ku Cheng-kang, Minister of the
                            recently organized Social Welfare Ministry, Hsu En-tseng, Vice Minister
                            of Communications and chief of the party Secret Service, Pan Kung-chan,
                            Vice Minister of the Central Publicity Board, and Chang Tao-fan,
                            Chairman of the Central Cultural Committee of the Kuomintang.</p>
                        <p>The clique is in control of the Party police, a secret organization which
                            investigates the conduct of party officials in the national and
                            provincial governments and also maintains a close supervision over
                            educational institutions and teaching throughout the country.</p>
                        <p>It is not easy to ascertain just what the clique stands for in national
                            life. It is of course primarily interested in the perpetuation and <pb
                                n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0228"/>increase of its own power. But
                            it is also looked upon by the radicals and liberals as the most
                            reactionary group of officials in the Kuomintang. Chen Li-fu is an
                            engineer (graduate of Pittsburgh University) and somewhat of a
                            philosopher. Chen Kuo-fu has been intimately associated with party
                            affairs during the thirty years of his adult life. Their father
                            befriended Chiang Kai-shek in his early days which probably accounts for
                            a “Chinese bond” which exists between them and the Generalissimo. The
                            Chens and their followers are nationalistic—national socialist in modern
                            parlance. Given a completely free hand, party tutelage under their
                            guidance would become absolute party dictatorship. In Europe they would
                            probably be called “fascists”. The “moderating leaven” of China saves
                            them from that. They are not anti-foreign; but neither are they
                            pro-foreign. They are “eastern” and nationalistic in their outlook. They
                            evince little sympathy with democratic concepts of government. With the
                            rest of Kuomintang officialdom, they are anti-communist. Chen Li-fu
                            speaks and writes with almost religious fervor of the great part which
                            Chinese culture, Chinese philosophy, the Chinese art of thought life
                            must play in the future up-building of China and the east. He wants
                            technical and material assistance from the west; but that is all. Chen
                            Kuo-fu speaks very little; is very little in the public eye; but behind
                            the scenes he is a potent force for party discipline—party discipline in
                            line with the undemocratic ideas of the “C–C” clique.</p>
                        <p>At this point it is convenient to insert mention of the President and
                            Vice President of the Examination Yuan, Tai Chi-tao and Chu Chia-hua
                            respectively. The Examination Yuan is the department of the government
                            charged with the duty of supervising and investigating the conduct of
                            government (as distinguished from Party) officials. Tai Chi-tao is an
                            elder statesman of the Party. He is not active in the Government,
                            preferring to study the classics, a course which it is understood has
                            led him away from the original Kuomintang concepts (he was once a
                            “revolutionary”) to advocacy of paternalistic government along the lines
                            of the early “Middle Kingdom”. His influence in the Government is almost
                            wholly personal and stems from his close association with Chiang
                            Kai-shek. They were fellow students in Japan; have remained close
                            friends since. It is understood that Tai sends to Chiang each week at
                            the request of the latter a digest result of his week’s perusal of the
                            classics.</p>
                        <p>Chu Chia-hua <hi rend="italic">is</hi> active in the Government. He
                            exercises considerable influence through his “management” of officials,
                            especially officials of the lower grades and those out in the provinces.
                            He is a German returned student and is credited with being an admirer of
                            the nazi form of government. Although neither Tai Chi-tao nor Chu
                            Chia-hua are directly associated with the “C–C” clique (Chu is in fact
                            used <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0229"/>somewhat by the
                            Generalissimo as a foil to the “C–C”) Tai’s paternalism and Chu’s nazi
                            leanings lend support to the “C–C” ideas and measures for party
                            government.</p>
                        <p>General Chang Chun, former foreign minister and present Chairman of the
                            government of Szechuan Province (the stronghold and support of the
                            National Government for the past four years) is an intimate and
                            influential friend and advisor of the Generalissimo and by virtue of
                            this association is looked upon as the leading member of the so-called
                            “Political Science Society” (Cheng Hsueh Hsi). Chiang and Chang were
                            fellow students in Japan and have been closely associated ever since.
                            The Cheng Hsueh Hsi is no longer an organization, as it was in the early
                            days of the Chinese Republic, with well denned policies and aims<note
                                n="*" xml:id="d177fn2">The Cheng Hsueh Hsi stems from the party that
                                grouped itself around Kang Yu Wei, the Chinese political reformer of
                                the late 1890s. They were known as the Wei Hsing Pai (Reform Party)
                                and advocated moderate progressive change in opposition to the
                                radical revolutionaries. After the revolution of 1911, the group
                                became known as the Cheng Hsueh Hsi and was especially active during
                                the parliamentary period in Peking (1912–15). The members were
                                largely intellectuals, familiar with the technique of government.
                                Liang Chi-chao was one of the early leaders of the group. After the
                                breakdown of parliamentary government and the beginning of the
                                “warlord period” the group had little influence except as
                                individuals, although a loose organization of sorts was maintained.
                                Their influence was strongest in provincial governments. When Chiang
                                Kai-shek’s northern conquest reached the Yangtze valley in 1926,
                                when he had broken with the communists, made his peace with the
                                Shanghai bankers and established his government at Nanking, need was
                                felt for men competent in government administration. At that time
                                Yang Yung-tai was the recognized leader of the Cheng Hsueh Hsi.
                                Chiang made him governor of Hupeh province and having placed him in
                                this important position he called other members of the group into
                                the government. [Footnote in the original.]</note>. It has become
                            simply the name applied to a certain type of Chinese officials who, by
                            training, character, and political outlook are conveniently grouped
                            together. Their outlook is conservative; it is “eastern” in
                            contradistinction to the “western” outlook of the Anglo-American trained
                            group. Many of the outstanding figures were students in Japan but the
                            group cannot be called pro-Japanese. They are, if an appellation is
                            needed, thoroughly pro-Chinese. The Cheng Hsueh Hsi members generally
                            were probably not imbued with much enthusiasm for resistance to Japan at
                            the inception of hostilities, favoring compromise arrangements, but they
                            have supported the Government in its policy of resistance.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to ascertain with any degree of certainty just what
                            officials today are considered to be adherents or “members” of the Cheng
                            Hsueh Hsi. Chang Chun has been named as the leading member. Wu
                            Ting-chang, Governor of Kweichow, is a highly respected and capable
                            official who ranks high in the group. Others are: Wang Chung-hui,
                            Secretary General of the Supreme National Defense Council, former
                            Foreign Minister and Judge of the Hague Court; Chang Chia-ngau, Minister
                            of Communications; Chen Yi, Secretary <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220"
                                facs="0230"/>General of the Executive Yuan; Tsiang Ting-fu, Director
                            of the Political Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan; Chen Pu-lei
                            (also close to the “C–C” clique) departmental chief in the
                            Generalissimo’s headquarters secretariate (Shih Chung Shih); Wong
                            Wen-hao, Minister of Economics; Wang Shih-chieh, Party Minister of
                            Information (Wang is also somewhat in the orbit of the “C–C”); Hsiung
                            Shih-hui, former Governor of Kiangsi and now head of the Chinese
                            military mission in Washington. General Wu Teh-chen, Secretary General
                            of the Kuomintang and as such titulary second ranking man in the party,
                            was at one time identified with the Cheng Hsueh Hsi. His influence is by
                            no means commensurate with his position. Many provincial officials are
                            associated with the Cheng Hsueh Hsi and some military commanders by
                            training and outlook are Cheng Hsueh Hsi in character. Ho Ying-chin is
                            an outstanding example.</p>
                        <p>These officials have been described as the intellectuals of the
                            government and party. It is true that as a group they are the best
                            trained men in the government. They are familiar with the form and
                            functioning of government according to the best Chinese standards.
                            Although they maintain a high respect for “things Chinese”, they are not
                            opposed to such western technique and technical processes as can be
                            safely grafted on the Chinese system without altering its character.
                            Many have a broad—a modern—outlook but they are looking through Chinese
                            eyes always. Their influence is largely personal. They do not have the
                            backing of an organization or machine or of military or popular groups
                            except in so far as they personally find favor with those groups.
                            Generally speaking the Cheng Hsueh Hsi membership finds Dr. Kung
                            distasteful and there have been undercurrent attempts to displace him.
                            When Kung was ill last winter Chang Chun was advocating Wu Ting-chang as
                            his successor. There is no particular antagonism between the Cheng Hsueh
                            Hsi and the “C–C” but where the latter is reactionary the former is only
                            conservative. Speaking generally, the group members may be counted upon
                            to use their influence against any form of radicalism without opposing
                            improvements which they consider consonant with Chinese life and
                            institutions. They believe in China; that is, in the Chinese in a
                            Chinese way.</p>
                        <p>General Ho Ying-chin as a young man participated in the Chinese
                            Revolution in 1911 and since that time he has been active in both
                            military and party affairs. Like so many of the prominent officials of
                            the Kuomintang, he studied in Japan for a period. Since 1930 he has been
                            Chief of Staff and Minister of Military Administration. While he has no
                            army immediately under him, he has been able through his long
                            administration of military affairs to establish a strong position with
                            the army, particularly with divisional and lesser commanders <pb n="221"
                                xml:id="pg_221" facs="0231"/>who look to him for preferment and
                            promotion. The fact that he was at one time chief instructor at the
                            Whampoa Military Cadets Academy (Canton) gives him a position of
                            influence with the group of army officers known as the “Whampoa Cadets”.
                            General Ho also wields considerable influence in Party politics. Stories
                            that he is pro-Japanese should be discounted. There is no evidence to
                            support such stories. He is, like his fellow party members in the Cheng
                            Hsueh Hsi, “eastern” in his viewpoint. Incidentally, his relations with
                            Cheng Hsueh Hsi members are good. Anti-communism is, with him, as with
                            so many of the Chinese military officers, an obsession. This gives rise
                            at times to the suspicion that he may be more interested in liquidating
                            the communist forces than in defeating the Japanese, and to the feeling
                            that Ho and others of his mind would view a Russian victory over Japan
                            in the Far East with only slightly less misgivings than a Japanese
                            victory. There is reason to suspect that this state of mind consciously
                            or unconsciously prompts Chinese insistence that Japan be eliminated
                            first after which full attention can be turned to aiding Russia defeat
                            Germany. Dr. Kung only recently in conversation with me outlined his
                            plan of strategy along those lines. Nothing would be more agreeable to a
                            large body of Kuomintang officials than to eliminate Japan while Russia
                            was still fully engaged in Europe, their thought, of course, being that
                            Russia would then have little say in the eventual peace settlement in
                            the Far East.</p>
                        <p>Stories that General Ho’s relations with General Chiang Kai-shek are not
                            on a friendly basis would seem to have as little foundation in fact as
                            stories that he is pro-Japanese. Reports indicate the contrary and,
                            whereas Ho enjoys a position in the Government and Party which many
                            think makes him the logical successor to Chiang, there is no indication
                            that he would lend himself to any scheme to supplant Chiang.</p>
                        <p>Tai Li, as Chief of the Statistical and Investigation Office of the
                            Military Affairs Commission, is chief of the secret military police.
                            Operatives under his control are estimated to number at least 100,000
                            men. Tai Li is a military man, a Whampoa Cadet, and as such a member of
                            the “Whampoa” clique in the army. And Tai Li is the completely trusted
                            subordinate—and guardian—of the Generalissimo, subject only to the
                            Generalissimo’s orders. He does the inside investigation jobs for the
                            Generalissimo; he is in charge of the Generalissimo’s personal
                            bodyguard; he, with his organization, is the medium through which much
                            unofficial “business” is done both in China and abroad; and he is
                            efficient.</p>
                        <p>Being head of a strong and secret organization and having the personal
                            confidence of the Generalissimo gives Tai Li a position of “influence”
                            in the Government and in the Army of no mean proportions. His
                            identification with the strong “Whampoa” clique in the Army <pb n="222"
                                xml:id="pg_222" facs="0232"/>strengthens his influence. His
                            organization is at times utilized to counterbalance the Party police
                            under the “C–C” clique—an illustration of one of the fundamental tenets
                            of Chiang’s policy in controlling the Kuomintang, that is, the
                            maintenance of an equilibrium of forces by means of checks and balances.
                            General Tai is, however, much more than a check or balance. He is the
                            personification of the latter day repressive tendencies of the
                            Kuomintang.</p>
                        <p>Although the primary objective of this memorandum is discussion of
                            influential elements in the Party and Government, it is believed that a
                            useful purpose will be served, somewhat in continuation of the
                            discussion of General Ho Ying-chin and General Tai Li, by giving a brief
                            account of the leading figures in the Army. Army commanders continue to
                            enjoy a large degree of independence in the areas in which they are
                            stationed. Warlordism is not dead and with the return of peace, it will
                            require strong management to prevent its active recrudescence as a major
                            political factor in China. Even now in the midst of war army commanders
                            are understood to be hoarding material against the day when they may
                            have to defend their position and prerogatives against a demand for
                            demobilization and the institution of civilian control.</p>
                        <p>General Hu Tsung-nan, with headquarters at Sian, Shensi, is credited with
                            having the largest and best equipped body of soldiers in China under his
                            command. Directly and indirectly he commands over 400,000 men stationed
                            in the area extending from western Honan through Shensi to Kansu. The
                            area is considered as being “politically” very strategic. Theoretically
                            Hu is under the commander of the 8th War Zone (General Chu Shao-liang);
                            practically, he is under the Generalissimo only. It is Hu Tsung-nan’s
                            troops who quarantine the communist forces in northern Shensi. He is
                            actively and thoroughly anti-communist. He was a leading spirit in the
                            organization known as the “Blue Shirts”, a semi-military, semi-political
                            body of men charged with the duty of keeping the Army free from
                            contamination from liberal or subversive influences. The organization
                            was disbanded because of the odium attached to colored shirts but
                            another group is being developed to take its place—the San Min Chu I
                            (the Kuomintang Three Principles of Dr. Sun) Youth Corps. This Corps is
                            trained along strict lines of Party loyalty and discipline. Civilian as
                            well as military officials are enlisted. It, as the “Blue Shirts” before
                            it, has a strong flavor of fascism.</p>
                        <p>Hu Tsung-nan is a leading member of the Army clique known as the “Whampoa
                            Cadets”. Although his relations with General Ho Ying-chin are understood
                            to be good, he enjoys direct relationship with the Generalissimo which
                            removes him from control by Ho. He is one of the Generalissimo’s most
                            trusted lieutenants. He is also an <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223"
                                facs="0233"/>intimate of his fellow “Cadet”, General Tai Li.
                            Together they make a strong pair. General Hu’s troops have done
                            virtually no fighting since 1938, although they are the best equipped in
                            China. The Russians complain that the best of the material which they
                            sent into China during 1938–40 went to this non-fighting organization.
                            Hu’s job would seem to be primarily the quarantine of the communists and
                            the maintenance of a safe base for retreat from the south and east to
                            the northwest in case of necessity. In this job he seems to have the
                            full support of the Generalissimo.</p>
                        <p>General Ch’en Ch’eng, also a “Whampoa Cadet”, and also a favorite of the
                            Generalissimo’s, is commander of the strategically important 6th War
                            Zone which covers western Hupeh, western Hunan, and eastern Szechuan. It
                            is the area in which a Chinese offensive, with the recapture of Ichang
                            as the initial objective, would produce immediately advantageous
                            results. But General Ch’en Ch’eng, although considered an able
                            commander, has done little to distinguish himself in recent years. At
                            one time he was looked upon as the logical successor to General Chiang,
                            but that day is long past. His importance today derives from the
                            confidence which Chiang reposes in him.</p>
                        <p>General Li Tsung-jen and General Pai Chung-hsi are military commanders
                            with political affiliations as leaders of the Kwangsi faction which in
                            1936 started an abortive rebellion against Chiang but since the outbreak
                            of hostilities against Japan, has cooperated loyally with the
                            Government. Li Tsung-jen is commander of the 5th War Zone with
                            headquarters at Laohokow, Hupeh. He is a good soldier and has under him
                            two good vice commanders in Generals Sun Lien-chung and Li Pin-hsien.
                            General Pai Chung-hsi is Vice Chief of Staff in Chungking. He has no
                            army. He is credited with being the best strategist in the Chinese army.
                            In addition to his leading position in the Kwangsi party, he wields a
                            considerable influence as the outstanding Mohammedan in the Chinese
                            Government. Loosely associated with Generals Li and Pai is General Chang
                            Fa-kwei (Old Ironsides) who is commander of the 4th or Kwangsi War Zone.
                            He is a good soldier and popular with the people. The 7th or Kwang-zung
                            War Zone is commanded by General Yu Han-mou with a very low reputation
                            as a soldier but in the good graces of the Generalissimo because he
                            “turned” loyal during the 1936 Kwangsi-Kwangtung rebellion.</p>
                        <p>General Ku Chu-tung, commander of the 3rd War Zone (principally Chekiang,
                            Kiangsi and Fukien provinces) which has in recent weeks been the scene
                            of successful Japanese offensives, is a Ho Ying-chin man. The aging and
                            inactive General Yen Hsi-shan is commander of the 2nd or Shansi War
                            Zone. Other commanders meriting mention are General Chiang Ting-wen, 1st
                            War Zone in Honan; <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0234"/>General Chu
                            Shao-liang, 8th War Zone with headquarters at Lan-chow; General Hsueh
                            Yueh, 9th or Hunan War Zone; General Yu Hsueh-chung on the
                            Shantung-Kiangsi border (former “northeast”—Manchuria—man) and General
                            Wei Li-huang on the Hopei–Chahar border. The list would not be complete
                            without the names of General Lung Yun, semi-independent Chairman of the
                            Yunnan Government and commander of the mediocre Yunnan army; and
                            Generals Fu Tso-yi and Ma Hung-kuei, theoretically commanders under Chu
                            Shao-liang (mentioned above) but actually semi-independent warlords in
                            the provinces of Suiyuan and Ninghsia respectively.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing description of Kuomintang leadership (in Government and
                            Army as well as Party) is suggestive rather than conclusive. The very
                            nature of the set-up precludes precise interpretation and statements
                            with regard to position, function, and meaning. The individuals,
                            elements, and cliques operate within a Party and Government framework in
                            a highly personal manner. However, some general deductions are
                            permissible.</p>
                        <p>It would seem to be clear from the foregoing that General Chiang Kai-shek
                            is the undisputed leader. His leading position derives as much from the
                            personal loyalties he commands as from the offices he holds. In large
                            measure the latter derives from the former. It follows that Chiang,
                            committed to resistance to the Japanese, will be able to pursue his
                            policies without major hindrance. There is no doubt that his supporters
                            exercise a modifying influence. In the matter of resistance, for
                            instance, there is reason to doubt that some of his supporters are as
                            convinced of the wisdom of all out Chinese resistance in cooperation
                            with America, England and Russia as the Generalissimo has indicated
                            himself to be. The conservative or “preservative” instinct of the Party
                            follows through to the Army, units of which are suspected of
                            unwillingness to expend their strength, desiring to conserve their
                            strength against the day when it may serve a useful purpose in internal
                            “adjustments”. The proposition of “containing” Japanese troops in China
                            is bad psychology. The Chinese have for five years been trying to get
                            rid of the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>While there is an unquestionable lack of matériel to carry on any major
                            offensive against the Japanese, there is also a lack of offensive
                            spirit, partially explained by the attitude of mind described above.
                            Hence, resistance may be expected to continue, but it may be expected to
                            continue to be “Chinese resistance”; not the active resistance which
                            western military critics desire and western eulogizers portray. Harm has
                            been done by both groups. The Chinese deserve much credit for the
                            resistance they have put up against the Japanese but no useful purpose
                            is served by great expectations for the near future. We may count on
                            resistance under Chiang and count on his having the continued, <pb
                                n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0235"/>if at times and in some
                            quarters conditional, support of his associates.</p>
                        <p>(It is highly improbable that a situation will arise which would cause
                            Chiang voluntarily to retire, and there is not believed to be the will
                            or the power in or out of Party ranks to cause his involuntary
                            retirement. Only a widespread lack of confidence in ultimate allied
                            victory could bring about Chiang’s retirement. Should he be fortuitously
                            removed from the scene the probabilities are that either Ho Ying-chin
                            would succeed him or a compromise candidate, such as Tai Chi-tao, would
                            be put forward and supported by General Ho, the Chens and Chang Chun
                            with Ho taking the commandership of the army under arrangement with such
                            powers as Hu Tsung-nan, Tai Li, etc., with the Chens taking over full
                            control of the Party, and with Chang Chun assuming the Presidency of the
                            Executive Yuan. Kung would probably be eased out and Soong influence
                            would diminish. This is purely speculative but indicates broadly what
                            might be expected. The attitude toward resistance, under such a set-up,
                            would depend largely upon the fortunes of war at the time. There would
                            be a tendency away from collaboration with the allied powers, the
                            “eastern” as distinguished from the “western” viewpoint would be
                            unchallenged, and a policy of “watch and wait” with regard to the war
                            would prevail. The principal preoccupation would be maintenance of
                            internal unity.)</p>
                        <p>With regard to internal administration under the present leadership, it
                            is obvious that the situation is heavily weighted on the side of
                            conservatism, political and selfish. Effective measures for financial,
                            economic and social reform cannot be expected from the present
                            leadership either now or in the post-war period. Whether or not the
                            Kuomintang as presently constituted will be able to maintain its
                            leadership after the war is a question which hinges on unpredictable
                            developments. There are younger elements in the party which are liberal
                            minded. They are numerous and intelligent but they occupy subordinate
                            posts and have little influence. There are also liberal groups outside
                            the party; and there is the communist element stronger potentially than
                            actually. If Russian armies prove to be a major factor in defeating the
                            Japanese armies the liberal and communist elements will undoubtedly be
                            strengthened. The Kuomintang, faced with this situation, could adopt two
                            courses. It could readily put into effect long overdue measures for
                            social and economic reform. By so doing it could gain the support of the
                            liberal elements in and out of the Party and cut the ground from under
                            the communists. On the other hand, frightened by liberal and popular
                            criticism and fearful of the communists, it could go to the extremes of
                            reaction, adopting oppressive and suppressive measures to kill all
                            opposition <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0236"/>and to maintain
                            itself in power. Under the present leadership the latter alternative
                            seems to be the more likely of the two. All the trappings for state
                            socialism along nazi lines are present: a strong party control under the
                            “C–C” clique; an effective gestapo under Tai Li; and a military power
                            and organization, headed by Ho Ying-chin, thoroughly asocial in its
                            outlook and bent on maintenance of its position and prerogatives in the
                            national life.</p>
                        <p>This is the darkest side of the picture. It is possible that the current
                            of social reform—that the demand for making victory a people’s victory
                            and peace a popular peace, as opposed to a peace of nationalism and
                            class interest—will be so strong that the Kuomintang will be swept along
                            with it or swept away to give place to the younger progressive elements
                            in the country. Those elements are present and if given a chance could
                            make the Kuomintang a vital force for instituting social as well as
                            political democracy in China. But these progressive elements must be
                            “given” the chance. The conservative opposition is too strong for them
                            to “take” it. Whether or not they are given the chance will depend very
                            largely on outside influences and pressure. There will be no voluntary
                            relinquishment. The Chens and the Tai Lis must go, the warlords and the
                            landlords must be subordinated to the national interest. This having
                            been accomplished, the Kungs and the Soongs and the Cheng Hsueh Hsi
                            might be fitted into a liberal regime, and the Chinese communists would
                            probably cooperate with it.</p>
                        <p>After victory, China will emerge as the strongest Far Eastern Nation. It
                            will be one of the major tasks of the post-war period to utilize our
                            influence and support to the end that liberal elements are enabled to
                            assume a position of leadership in the government of China.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Messages From Chinese Communists</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>During Mr. Currie’s stay in Chungking a representative of General Chou
                        En-lai, Communist representative at the Chinese capital, delivered to me
                        several messages for Mr. Currie.</p>
                    <p>Somewhat by way of background, he reported with amusement that the day on
                        which Mr. Currie arrived in Chungking the Generalissimo <pb n="227"
                            xml:id="pg_227" facs="0237"/>crossed the river from his summer residence
                        and met General Chou for the first time in “nearly a year”. The trip into
                        Chungking was apparently solely for the purpose of meeting with General
                        Chou. The Generalissimo was said to have expressed great solicitude for
                        General Chou’s health (the latter has been ill for some weeks but is
                        recovering) and to have urged the Communist leader to make use of General
                        Chiang’s residence on Mount Omei to regain his health. It was stated that
                        General Chou was at a loss to explain this concern over his welfare and
                        other sudden demonstrations of Central Government cordiality to the
                        Communists until he learned that Mr. Currie had arrived.</p>
                    <p>This incident, General Chou’s representative stated, illustrated the Central
                        Government’s sensitiveness to American opinion. During Mr. Currie’s last
                        visit, he continued, relations between the Central Government and the
                        Communists improved. The same development appeared to be occurring during
                        Mr. Currie’s second visit.</p>
                    <p>It was indicated that General Chou wished to have a talk with Mr. Currie.
                        However, when I later reported that Mr. Currie considered it impolitic at
                        this time to meet General Chou, the reply seemed to be accepted with
                        understanding and in good part.</p>
                    <p>There were two special messages which General Chou desired to be delivered to
                        Mr. Currie. (1) The Chinese Communists hope that the American Government
                        will take steps which will insure the use of lend-lease supplies in
                        accordance with the purpose of such American aid. The fear was expressed
                        that unless the American Government maintained a firm and constantly
                        watchful attitude on this score lend-lease supplies would be hoarded for use
                        after the war in maintaining the position of the ruling faction. (2) The
                        Chinese Communists would welcome a visit to Communist-controlled areas by
                        one or several representatives of the American Government. It was suggested
                        that the Generalissimo could reasonably be requested to grant permission for
                        such an inspection tour on the grounds that the American Government should,
                        in view of the possibility of a Japanese attack on Siberia, have first-hand
                        information with regard to this vital border region and the Communist
                        armies. American Army officers were mentioned as the most logical officials
                        to be sent.</p>
                    <p>My informants described a strange situation in Sinkiang Province, the
                        description of which I have been unable to verify. These Communist sources
                        stated that, alarmed by recent attempts of the Central Government to extend
                        its influence in Sinkiang Province, the Chairman wrote a letter to Stalin
                        offering to place Sinkiang under Soviet protection. It was stated that the
                        Chairman received a reply from Molotov to the effect that the Soviet
                        Government maintained good relations with the National Government of China
                        and could deal only <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0238"/>with that
                        Government. Upon receipt of this rebuff, the Chairman was said to have
                        become highly incensed, discharged four Chinese Communists acting as
                        provincial departmental chiefs (Finance and Education were mentioned),
                        executed his younger brother who was a Soviet sympathizer and prohibited
                        trade with the Soviet Union. The Chairman’s actions were declared to have
                        caused the Soviet Government to turn over to the Central Government of China
                        copies of Chairman Sheng’s letter to Stalin and Molotov’s reply. The
                        recently redoubled activities of the Central Government in the Northwest—Pai
                        Chung-hsi’s and Wong Wen-hao’s prolonged visits—my informants explained,
                        were Chungking’s reactions to the above-described developments.</p>
                    <p>There were also reported instances of numerous secret arrests during the
                        final week of Mr. Currie’s visit. It was not suggested that there was
                        anything significant in the timing of the arrests. Practically all of those
                        detained or taken without knowledge of family or friends were small
                        officials from the “Three Northeastern Provinces”. No Communists were
                        detained, because “there are 600,000 Communist troops”. The
                        “Northeasterners” are, however, a weak and scattered group. The arrests were
                        not made by Tai Li’s organization, according to my informants, but by the
                        Kuomintang’s party police. It was said that while the Party may investigate
                        it does not have the authority to make arrests. The foregoing was told me by
                        way of demonstrating that the Four Freedoms are not lived up to in
                        Chungking.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose for the
                        Department’s information a copy of a statement<note n="29" xml:id="d179fn29"
                            >Not printed.</note> prepared by the Central Committee of the Chinese
                        Communist Party on the Fifth Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War. This
                        statement was not released for publication in Chungking newspapers and has
                        been obtained by the Embassy from a confidential source.</p>
                    <p>The statement of the Communist Party is of particular interest in that it
                        calls attention frankly to the existing dissension between the Kuomintang
                        and the Communist Party and sets forth a program to end the antagonism
                        between the two parties not only during the war but also for the post-war
                        period. Its aims are a democratic China, <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229"
                            facs="0239"/>neither dictatorial nor socialist; economic prosperity for
                        all, not for one section—without confiscation by force of land or factories;
                        Universal suffrage; unification and peace; and an independent China, not
                        colonial or semi-colonial. The post-war China should be built on the
                        principles of San Min Chu I, the Kuomintang’s program of resistance and
                        reconstruction and the Communist Party’s administrative and social
                        policies.</p>
                    <p>The statement reiterates the principles established by the Communist Party in
                        September, 1937, when it announced (1) its willingness to abandon all
                        attempts to overthrow the Kuomintang, its policy of land confiscation by
                        force and bolshevization and (2) its readiness to incorporate its army into
                        the national armed forces and dissolve its Soviet government. Attention is
                        called to the observance by the Communist Party of these principles.</p>
                    <p>A plea is made for united support by all factions of the leadership of
                        Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek both during the war and in the post-war period
                        of reconstruction and the party indicates its desire to discuss with the
                        Kuomintang the issues and to improve the relations between the two parties,
                        thereby eliminating opportunity for Japanese intrigues and preserving a
                        united front against Japanese aggression.</p>
                    <p>In contrast to the demands of the Chinese Government that the Far Eastern
                        front not be subordinated to the European war zone, the Communist Party
                        insists that Hitlerism should be defeated this year and that China, Great
                        Britain and the United States would then be able to defeat Japan in
                        1943.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy does not know what reply the Kuomintang has made to the Communist
                        Party’s statement. In view, however, of the existing circumstances under
                        which the Communist armies in the Northwest are, according to all reports,
                        very poorly equipped and are blockaded by approximately 400,000 of the
                        National Government’s best equipped troops under General Hu Tsung-nan, the
                        Kuomintang may be expected to oppose any participation by the Communist
                        Party in post-war reconstruction, with force if necessary.</p>

                            <item>Sheng Shih-tsai, for the past 9 years chief of the Sinkiang
                                Government which has been strongly under the Russian influence, has
                                indicated his willingness to recognize the authority of the
                                Chungking Government to subordinate the Provincial Government to the
                                National Government and to permit the extension of Kuomintang
                                influence to Sinkiang. Sheng has written a letter to Molotov
                                confirming his allegiance to the Chungking Government. Informant is
                                not yet aware of Russian reaction to Sheng’s <hi rend="italic"
                                    >volte-face</hi> but expresses concern over the situation in
                                view of the strong position politically and economically which
                                Russia has occupied in Sinkiang in late years. He states that
                                Russian troops serving in Sinkiang forces under the Chinese flag are
                                numerous especially at Tihwa where he spent several weeks and at

                                which in recent years have become strong in the Sinkiang Government.

                                undertaking to eradicate, is strong, open and highly placed in
                                Sinkiang. It is Chinese with Russian support. In Kansu, he found
                                that Communist influence was consequential but under cover, and was
                                Chinese without Russian support.</item>

                    <p>The economic situation in Sinkiang is not unfavorable, although there is
                        currency inflation—not so prominent as in China proper, but nevertheless
                        obvious. The provincial currency is not tied to National Government
                        currency. Ninety percent of Sinkiang’s export trade is with Russia. Russia
                        has made extensive investments in the province. The oil fields have first
                        class equipment owned by Russia. They are producing only twenty to thirty
                        thousand gallons of gasoline monthly, but informant felt that production
                        could be increased considerably. He is anxious (but recognizes the
                        difficulty) that the Chinese Government gain control over the operation and
                        production of the fields. (Embassy must request strict protection of the

                        Pu-ching’s forces in North Kansu by Central Government troops puts Chungking
                        in position to apply direct military pressure on Sinkiang; that Chungking

                        expect that their efforts to get a foothold in the province will be
                        facilitated by Russo-Japanese hostilities.</p>
                    <p>4. It is not practicable now to make an appraisal of new course of events in
                        northwest. It would appear obvious that Chinese Government is taking
                        advantage of situation in Russia to extend its influence into Sinkiang at
                        Russian expense. Politically it is of course operating within its rights.
                        What will be reaction of inhabitants, majority of whom are not Chinese but
                        Turks and distrustful of Chinese, if [<hi rend="italic">is</hi>] question
                        for future. They would not unaided be able to resist Chinese but given
                        Russian support they might become formidable obstacle to Chinese plans. They
                        do not seem to have suffered from Russian influence of recent years and it
                        is far from certain that Russians are in fact prepared to accept designed
                        consequences of Sheng’s transference of allegiance although they may find it
                        necessary and politic in present circumstances to refrain from open
                        opposition.</p>

                    <p>971. Reference Embassy’s 954, August 19, 1 p.m. Responsible Russian official,
                        discussing recent China-Sinkiang developments with Vincent, commented as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>Chungking Government officials had long been needlessly suspicious of Russian
                        relations with Sinkiang and that he therefore welcomed indications that the
                        Sinkiang Government was drawing closer to Chungking, a development which he
                        hoped would place the Russian position in proper perspective. Russia was
                        interested in a continuation of its trade relations with Sinkiang (relations
                        which are mutually beneficial and which cannot rationally be replaced by
                        relations with China) and in the eventual development of Sinkiang resources
                        with Russian assistance if desired (so far Russia has been of assistance
                        only in limited development of oil [apparent omission] good humor [<hi
                            rend="italic">sic</hi>], that although China seemed to be taking
                        advantage of a “military <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0242"/>situation”
                        to further its interests in Sinkiang, Russia did not object and hoped that
                        China would realize that fears of Sinkiang becoming a member of the USSR
                        would disappear.</p>
                    <p>Insofar as Russia was concerned, Sinkiang was an area having a long common
                        boundary with Russia with which Russia desired to remain on neighborly
                        terms.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing should be accepted with reservation in the light of past 10
                        years as a conservative statement in sense that it may represent a desire to
                        rationalize an unwelcome but unavoidable development but Embassy
                        nevertheless gains impression that Russians are not in fact especially
                        concerned over probable new turn of events in Sinkiang.</p>

                    <p>1005. 1. Vice Minister of Information Tong<note n="31" xml:id="d182fn31"
                            >Hollington K. Tong.</note> told Vincent the following in
                        confidence:</p>
                    <p>A military conference will be convened at Sian shortly. In addition to
                        discussions of northwest military problems in the light of recent
                        developments in Sinkiang, the conference will take up Central Government
                        relations with the Chinese Communists in North Shensi. Mao Tse-tung, invited
                        to attend, declined but is sending a representative. The Generalissimo will
                        probably attend the conference. He had a long talk with Chou En-lai,
                        Communist representative in Chungking just before he, Chiang, departed for
                        northwest.</p>
                    <p>2. It is understood that proposal along following lines will be made to
                        Communists: (1), that they permit the complete integration of Communist
                        armies with National army; (2), that Communist controlled territories be
                        placed completely under Kuomintang Government administration and, (3), that
                        Communist leaders, including Mao Tse-tung, came [<hi rend="italic"
                        >come</hi>] to Chungking where they will be completely free to organize
                        their party and play their role in national affairs.</p>
                    <p>3. Informant mentioned in paragraph 1 speaks of rift in Communist ranks,
                        describing it as a difference between indigenous or “Chinese Communists” and
                        “Russian Chinese Communists”. He thinks the former may go [<hi rend="italic"
                            >be?</hi>] prepared to “Cooperate” with the Kuomintang.</p>
                    <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0243"/>
                    <p>4. The Embassy is not sanguine over the outcome of the conference. Chiang
                        Kai-shek is no doubt anxious to settle once and for all the Communist
                        problem. Fortified with his success in Sinkiang and taking further advantage
                        of the present adverse military situation of Russia and its probable
                        involvement with Japan in Siberia; he hopes to liquidate the “Communist
                        menace” in the northwest. It appears likely however that the Yenan
                        Communists will reject the proposals listed in paragraph 2. Whether the
                        Generalissimo will then authorize a use of force remains to be seen. The
                        suggestion in paragraph 3 of a split in the Communist ranks may give a clue
                        as to future line of action. So-called “Chinese Communists” may be produced
                        who will agree to the proposals, a united front will be established, and if
                        internal and external factors appear favorable, an attack may be launched on
                        the “non-cooperative” Communists in north Shensi.</p>

                    <p>On August 30th I was informed very confidentially by Dr. King [<hi
                            rend="italic">Kung</hi>] that negotiations were proceeding favorably by
                        Gissimo at Lanchow for the extension of Central Government control over
                        Sinkiang. He strongly intimated that the Russians are not pleased although
                        they are not able to prevent this due to Chinese sovereignty over the area.
                        He further asserted that the Soviets had engineered the murder of the
                        Governor’s brother by his wife as a protest to that official’s visit to
                        Chungking for preliminary talks in June. Dr. King [<hi rend="italic"

                        standing by in Kensu [<hi rend="italic">Kansu</hi>] but had not yet entered
                        the province.</p>
                    <p>According to another usually reliable source I am now informed that on the
                        31st of August Madame Chiang arrived Urumchi together with representatives
                        of Gissimo to consummate negotiations. The latter is remaining in Lanchow
                        unable, possibly for reasons of face to go all the way, to meet the
                        subordinate who himself is unable due to local tension to leave his
                        province.</p>
                    <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0244"/>
                    <p>The official party includes Kuomintang officials, military and Foreign
                        Office, all of whom will be stationed here. It is probable that the
                        arrangements will be similar to those in effect in Yunnan.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime Chiang has invited the Communist leader Mao Tze-tung to come
                        to Lanchow. It is said that the latter is sending Lin Piao his Chief of
                        Staff.</p>
                    <p>It is indicated at the present time that Gissimo has engineered an
                        outstanding political victory both over the Chinese Reds and Moscow.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose for the
                        Department’s information a translation of an article from the <hi
                            rend="italic">Central Daily News</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sao Tang
                            Pao</hi> of August 23, 1942, and a China Information Committee Bulletin
                        (Ministry of Information release) entitled “Democratic Features in Local
                            Assemblies”<note n="33" xml:id="d184fn33">Neither printed.</note>
                        concerning the regulations governing the organization of and the election of
                        delegates to the Provincial People’s Assembly.</p>
                    <p>The Legislative Yuan on August 20 passed two sets of regulations, one
                        governing the organization of the Provincial People’s Assembly and the other
                        the election of its delegates, to be presented to the National Government
                        for promulgation at an unnamed future date.</p>
                    <p>These Assemblies envisaged in these regulations will have the power to enact
                        provincial ordinances and to deliberate on the distribution of provincial
                        expenditures, while the existing provisional people’s assemblies have power
                        only to make proposals to, listen to reports from and to interpellate the
                        provincial governments. If any resolutions passed by the new Assemblies are
                        contrary to the Three People’s Principles or National policy, the President
                        of the Executive Yuan, with the approval of the Yuan meeting, can petition
                        the National Government to dissolve the provincial assembly concerned.</p>
                    <p>The People’s Assembly in each province will be composed of one delegate from
                        each county and municipality within that province. Delegates will be elected
                        and can also be recalled by the county or municipal representative
                        assemblies. To be eligible for election to the Assembly, a person must be a
                        citizen of the Republic of China, over twenty-five years of age, must have
                        maintained residence in the province in question for more than a year, must
                        have been or be a <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0245"/>member of a
                        county representative assembly and must have worked in a government
                        organization or have devoted himself or herself to the promotion of public
                        welfare in that province for more than a year. Persons holding positions in
                        government organizations, in the Chinese army or police forces or still
                        pursuing studies in school are not eligible for election.</p>
                    <p>While the proposed Provincial People’s Assemblies do represent a further step
                        toward representative government when compared with the existing provisional
                        people’s assemblies, sufficient safeguards have been retained on the power
                        of these new assemblies in that no legislation contrary to national policy
                        may be passed, the definition thereof apparently being left to the President
                        of the Executive Yuan, and in that the Assemblies can only deliberate on the
                        distribution of provincial expenditures and cannot control such action.
                        However, as a means of education in the principles of representative
                        government these assemblies and the county assemblies should serve to spread
                        the elements of democratic practices among increasing numbers of Chinese
                        people.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose a copy of a
                        memorandum reporting several conversations in regard to the related matters
                        mentioned in the subject heading.</p>
                    <p>With regard to developments in the northwest, the Embassy refers to its
                        telegram no. 954, August 19, 1 p.m., and to subsequent telegrams on the
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the Sian conference (Kuomintang-Communist relations) reference
                        is made to the Embassy’s telegram no. 1005 of September 5, 9 a.m. As
                        logical, desirable, and correct as the solution described by Drs. Wong and
                        Tsiang for the communist problem may appear to be, it is felt that the
                        communists will be loath to accept such a solution. Officially they consider
                        themselves at present under the National Government (as distinguished from
                        the Kuomintang). So does the National Government. But what amounts to a
                        demand for their complete abandonment of identity (territorially,
                        politically, <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0246"/>and militarily) will
                        probably meet with opposition, because, if for no other reason, the
                        communists will not have confidence in the Government’s promise to go
                        through with the “quid pro quo” offer; that is, the offer of freedom to the
                        communist party to organize and function in Chungking and in free China
                        generally without interference. Past performance and the present repressive
                        attitude of the Kuomintang and Government in free China support the
                        communists’ fears.</p>
                    <p>With regard to Sino-Soviet relations, the Embassy intends to follow the
                        matter with close attention, believing that, if and when Soviet-Japanese
                        hostilities occur, some fundamental or basic understanding between China and
                        the Soviet Union will be imminently and eminently desirable for the
                        prosecution of the war and the making of the peace in this area.</p>

                        <p>This afternoon I called on Dr. Wong Wen-hao, Minister of Economics, and
                            on Dr. T. F. Tsiang, Director of the Department of Political Affairs in
                            the Executive Yuan (formerly Ambassador to Russia).</p>
                        <p>After disposing of the immediate question at hand—the transportation of
                            strategic metals to Kunming for air transport to India—the conversation
                            with Dr. Wong turned to recent developments in the northwest. Dr. Wong
                            expressed himself as satisfied with the way matters had turned out in
                            Sinkiang. He said that in so far as he knew Russian troops were still at
                            Hami but he thought fears that Russia might make trouble over the
                            extension of Chinese Government control to Sinkiang were ill-founded. He
                            said that, based on his observations while in Sinkiang during July and
                            on his subsequent conversations with members of the Russian Embassy
                            here, he felt that Russia was in no mood to place obstacles in the way
                            of the Chinese Government’s plans for bringing Sinkiang back into the
                            fold, politically at least. He said that the Foreign Office had already
                            sent a representative to Tihua and that Sheng Shih-tsai had given clear
                            evidence of his desire to subordinate the provincial administration to
                            the National Government. The matter of the withdrawal of the <pb n="237"
                                xml:id="pg_237" facs="0247"/>Russian troops might prove difficult
                            but it was not, he thought, serious. He said that the assassination
                            several months ago of the “fourth” brother of Sheng Shih-tsai
                            (provincial government chairman) by Chinese communist agents had
                            thoroughly frightened Sheng (this brother was married to a Russian
                            communist who Dr. Wong thought had engineered the assassination). Sheng
                            had been afraid for his own life. He had written to Moscow expressing
                            suspicion that the Russian Consul General at Tihua had been implicated
                            in the assassination, or at least was involved in communist plotting,
                            and asked for his recall. The Russians had replied not unsympathetically
                            but had denied that the Consul General was engaged in any activities
                            other than those connected with the discharge of his official duties.
                            Dr. Wong remarked that “this was to be expected.”</p>
                        <p>General Chiang Kai-shek’s successful visit to Tihua had been the
                            culmination of developments since July. The removal of Ma Pu-ching’s
                            troops from northwestern Kansu to Chinghai had cleared the way for loyal
                            contingents of national government troops thereby placing the route from
                            Lanchow to Sinkiang safely under government control. He did not say
                            whether government troops had entered Sinkiang but I inferred that
                            perhaps they had not, pending withdrawal of the Russian troops from
                            Hami.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Wong said that he knew nothing of what had taken place or was taking
                            place at the military conference at Sian which General Chiang is at
                            present attending. He thought however that settlement of the Sinkiang
                            problem would faciliate the discussions at Sian with particular
                            reference to those related to the communists in north Shensi. Without
                            expressing any optimism that it would be, he said the communist
                            situation should be solved and that the solution lay in the communists
                            (government and army) recognizing the authority of the National
                            Government and in the Kuomintang’s recognizing the right of the
                            communist party to exist and play a role in national affairs without
                            interference. He said that the existence within China of a communist
                            government and army which, whatever the face-saving formal status, acted
                            independently was an anomoly which should not be allowed to
                            continue.</p>
                        <p>I asked Dr. Wong his opinion regarding Sino-Soviet relations in general;
                            what he thought were the principal problems involved in those relations.
                            He replied promptly that the situation he had just described—the
                            communists in China—was the principal problem. He felt that, despite
                            protests to the contrary, the communists in China were receiving aid and
                            comfort from Russia which supported them in the attitude of
                            independence. I asked what he thought could be done about this,
                            suggesting that some understanding between China <pb n="238"
                                xml:id="pg_238" facs="0248"/>and Russia along the lines of the
                            recent Anglo-Soviet treaty<note n="35" xml:id="d185fn35">Signed at

                            considering (when, as anticipated, Japan attacked Russia in Siberia) as
                            a means of settling the problem he mentioned and of removing Chinese
                            suspicions and distrust which no one could deny existed. He agreed
                            adding that there were no fundamental problems between China and Russia
                            that could not be solved. In fact, there was only the problem of the
                            position of the Chinese communists in China and the attitude of the
                            Russians toward them. He had no fear of Russian territorial designs upon
                            China (Manchuria) at the conclusion of the war. There ensued some
                            discussion of the desirability of China and Russia arriving at a basic
                            understanding prior to peace rather than waiting for a peace conference
                            to reach (or debate) such an understanding. I said that with mutual
                            goodwill it should not be difficult to do so and that certainly the
                            possibilities were worth exploring.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Tsiang and I discussed Ambassador Davies’ book<note n="36"
                                xml:id="d185fn36">Joseph E. Davies, <hi rend="italic">Mission to
                                    Moscow</hi> (1941).</note> on Russia and also a monograph which
                            Dr. Tsiang had done some years ago on Russo-Chinese relations. He said
                            that he was the “expert” on Far Eastern affairs to whom Mr. Davies
                            referred in his book; that he and Mr. Davies had been close friends
                            while they were together in Moscow. I asked for a copy of Dr. Tsiang’s
                            monograph but he said that there was no copy in Chungking; that it had
                            not been translated into English; and that it only dealt with early
                            Russo-Chinese relations from their beginning down to 1860. He spoke of
                            one heretofore unpublished document he had found in Peking regarding the
                            peace of 1860 which terminated the 1858–60 hostilities between China and
                            the Anglo-French combination. He said that in this official Chinese
                            paper he found the statement that, although it had been England and
                            France which had made war on China and advanced to Peking, Russia was
                            the nation against which China should be on guard.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing statement provoked a general discussion of present and
                            prospective Sino-Soviet relations. There was nothing new in his remarks
                            regarding Sinkiang developments. He seemed optimistic; mentioned a
                            Russian “brigade” in Sinkiang as one of the principal still unsettled
                            problems; said he did not feel that Russia really had political
                            ambitions in Sinkiang; and considered commercial relations between
                            Russia and Sinkiang as “natural as those between Canada and the United
                            States”.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the Sian conference, he, as Dr. Wong, hoped for a solution
                            of the communist problem. The problem and the solution he described in
                            almost identical terms as Dr. Wong. He was not opposed <pb n="239"
                                xml:id="pg_239" facs="0249"/>to a communist party in China but he
                            was opposed to a communist government and army acting independently in
                            China. He felt that, although the relation between the Chinese
                            communists and the National Government was an internal problem, it
                            involved relations between China and Russia. He believed that a
                            satisfactory understanding between Russia and China with regard to
                            Chinese communists or communism in China was essential to any
                            fundamental agreement between the two countries, and that such an
                            understanding should be simply one involving a sincere Russian
                            undertaking to refrain from any interference in internal politics of
                            China. He expressed himself as emphatically not among those who harbored
                            some fear that, if Russia defeated Japan on land in the east, it would
                            want territorial concessions in Manchuria or elsewhere. He referred back
                            to his period as Ambassador in Moscow and said that he still felt that,
                            had they received the support of their respective governments, he and
                                Litvinov<note n="37" xml:id="d185fn37">Maxim Litvinov, former Soviet
                                Commissar for Foreign Affairs.</note> could have produced a
                            satisfactory solution of outstanding problems. Litvinov had agreed with
                            him that the Chinese Government could not be expected to tolerate
                            independent or semi-independent communist administrative or military
                            organs in China. This was in 1937. The war with Japan followed soon
                            thereafter.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the territorial question, Dr. Tsiang said that he felt about
                            Outer Mongolia much the same as he felt about Tibet. He had some weeks
                            ago told me that he thought that Tibet should have the status of a
                            self-governing dominion and that Dr. Kung held the same view. He said
                            that if both China and England refrained from any interference in
                            Tibetan affairs the Tibetans would be able to govern themselves at least
                            well enough to prevent the area from becoming an international problem.
                            China’s historical attitude toward Outer Mongolia had been mistaken. The
                            Mongolians were in no sense Chinese and there was no valid reason for
                            denying them self-government.</p>
                        <p>The sum and substance of Dr. Tsiang’s remarks on Sino-Soviet relations
                            was that, if Russia would give a sincere pledge to refrain from
                            interference (actively or by propaganda and 3rd International tactics)
                            in China’s internal affairs particularly as they related to Chinese
                            communism, a fundamental understanding between the two countries along
                            the lines of the Anglo-Russian treaty would not be difficult to achieve.
                            I said I thought the Russians might be prepared to give such a
                            pledge.</p>
                        <p>In connection with these conversations with Dr. Wong and Dr. Tsiang, I
                            recall remarks made to me by Dr. Kung some ten days ago in the course of
                            a general discussion on political and military developments. Dr. Kung
                            said that the Russian attitude toward the communists <pb n="240"
                                xml:id="pg_240" facs="0250"/>in China was the principal obstacle to
                            easy relations between Russia and China and was sceptical with regard to
                            the feasibility of any basic agreement between the two countries. He
                            admitted the desirability, however, of reaching an early, pre-peace
                            understanding with Russia and commented that “American influence with
                            Russia is very strong at this time and America might be able to do
                            something to bring about a satisfactory understanding or agreement.”</p>

                            <p>(<hi rend="smallcaps">Note</hi>: In considering the foregoing
                                comments of Dr. Wong and Dr. Tsiang, it should be borne in mind that
                                these two officials represent a more moderate or liberal point of
                                view regarding Chinese Communists and Russia than is to be found
                                generally among leading military and Kuomintang officials who are by
                                and large anti-communist and suspicious of Russia to a degree that
                                is unreasoning and prejudicial to national unity and long-view
                                interests. However, it is felt that the viewpoint of Drs. Wong and
                                Tsiang is well worth consideration as representative of a large
                                element in and out of the government which does not sympathize with
                                the one-party “reactionarism” of the Kuomintang and military
                                leadership as now composed. J. C. V.)</p>

                        despatch no. 573 of August 13, 1942, concerning the statement of the
                        Communist Party on the Fifth Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War and to
                        enclose for the Department’s information a translation of an editorial<note

                    <p>The editorial refers to the above-mentioned statement and repeats its
                        adherence to the four principles enunciated by the Party at the beginning of
                        the war: (1) realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s <hi rend="italic">San Min Chu
                            I</hi>, (2) cessation of attempts to overthrow the Kuomintang and
                        suspension of the land confiscation policy, (3) abolition of the Party’s
                        Soviet Government and substitution of democracy in government and, (4)
                        incorporation of the Red Army into the National Government’s Army for
                        service against the Japanese, The Party issues an open statement in order to
                        discredit the existing rumors inimical to it and to its relations with the
                        Kuomintang: (1) The Party expresses genuine <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241"
                            facs="0251"/>willingness to fight for the realization of the <hi

                        war against Japan, the Party genuinely assumes the responsibility of service
                        at the front; (3) since both in war and in peace close cooperation among all
                        classes is essential, the Party is genuinely desirous of the cessation of
                        civil strife; and (4) the Party’s appeal for democratic government is
                        genuine since it believes that democracy is both the aim of the people and
                        the chief means of achieving unity and the mobilization of the people for
                        war and for reconstruction.</p>

                    <p>1070. Reference my 1005, September 5, 9 a.m. Although it is probable that the
                        Communist problem was discussed at military conference convened by
                        Generalissimo at Sian, there was no Communist representative present due to
                        tardiness in issuance of invitation and unfavorable travel conditions which
                        did not permit the representative appointed, General Lin Piao, to arrive at
                        Sian until after the departure of Generalissimo. General Lin is prepared to
                        come on to Chungking for conference if Generalissimo so requests. Communist
                        representative at Chungking anticipates that neither general settlement nor
                        conflict will develop from present Kuomintang–Communist situation.</p>

                        from a well-informed source.</p>
                    <p>The so-called “Russian Brigade” at Hami is reported to be two regiments of
                        “white” troops recruited by Sheng Shih-tsai some years ago and still under
                        his command. General Ho Yao-tsu was offered chairmanship of Sinkiang
                        Provincial Government but declines to accept post until he is assured
                        control also of troops in the Province. Hence, settlement awaits
                        satisfactory disposition of Sheng’s military forces including the Russian

                        Tihwa. It is not anticipated that Soviet Russia will place any obstacles in
                        the way of settlement in Sinkiang.</p>

                    <p>During a visit to the Foreign Office this afternoon, after disposing of the
                        matters which were the occasion of my visit, I turned the conversation into
                        general channels and found opportunity to ask whether progress is being made
                        in the adjustment of the situation in Sinkiang.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Fu replied that matters are proceeding satisfactorily and the Soviet
                        attitude has been reasonable. The Chairman of the Sinkiang Provincial
                        Government, General Sheng Shih-tsai, also is cooperating satisfactorily. Mr.
                        Chaucer Wu, he said, had arrived in Sinkiang as Commissioner of Foreign
                        Affairs and all foreign affairs in the Province are now in his hands under
                        control and direction of the central government. It is proposed to effect a
                        reorganization of the province and to bring internal matters and also Party
                        matters more firmly under national government supervision.</p>
                    <p>I asked whether the so-called “Russian brigade” is still at Hami, whether any
                        difficulty is being experienced in this matter of troops; are the Russians
                        of this brigade “white” or “red” and are they provincial troops. Mr. Fu said
                        that the Russians are provincial troops, “whites” turned “red”; and then he
                        went on to say that of course the whole matter of the discussions with the
                        Soviet Government is one of extreme delicacy and that it must be handled
                        with the greatest care. <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0253"/>However, so
                        far, the Soviet Government attitude has been reasonable.</p>
                    <p>I referred to the fact that Sinkiang adjoins Soviet territory and being
                        distant from Chinese commercial centers in China proper, it is but natural
                        that there is considerable border trade between the U. S. S. R. and
                        Sinkiang, and presumably the Russians are particularly interested in the
                        development of Sinkiang as an immediately adjoining territory. Mr. Fu
                        replied that he thought perhaps there is too much Russian interest in the
                        development of Sinkiang; and he added with a smile that there is even talk
                        of inviting Americans and the British to come into the Province (presumably,
                        to offset Soviet influence). I took occasion to mention the oil development
                        in Sinkiang, inquiring whether this was not principally a Soviet
                        development. Mr. Fu hesitated and then replied that he thought it would
                        become necessary to have some discussions with the Soviet Government on this
                        development; that he expected that such discussions would be opened. After
                        making this statement he apparently thought better as to this disclosure and
                        asked me to regard it as strictly confidential between us and not to be
                        passed on. As I felt that I had developed this general subject as far as I
                        could at this conversation, I passed on to other topics.</p>

                        general political situation in the Far East. In the course of this

                        between the Central Government of China and the Chinese “Communists”, with
                        indication that neither of them felt that this situation was especially
                        serious. Mr. Hornbeck offered comment that the effects of the continuing
                        dissension between the “Communists” and the Chinese Government were more
                        important than the causes; and Mr. Hamilton made comment that the United

                        unity and stability. Mr. Hornbeck’s and Mr. Hamilton’s comments were based

                                >Worker</hi>, October 4, 1942, front page, under banner heading:
                            “Browder accuses State Dep’t clique”. Mr. Browder charged that
                            reactionary officials in the Department were encouraging Generalissimo
                            Chiang Kai-shek to keep his best armies out of the war with Japan with a
                            view to liquidating Chinese Communist armies. No copy of “intended
                            statement” found in Department files.</note> under consideration. On the
                        contrary, this Department has always deprecated civil strife in China and
                        over a period of many years, including recent years, has exerted its
                        influence toward the discouraging of any such strife. Any allegation that
                        the United States Government would be displeased or has said that it would
                        be displeased if “unity was established in China” is the exact opposite of
                        the truth. The American Government has at no time entertained a policy of
                        “war against the Communist” in China. In fact, this Government has
                        repeatedly expressed skepticism regarding alarmist accounts of the serious
                        menace of “Communism” in China. The affirmation that officials of the
                        Department “tell Chungking it must continue to fight the Communists if it
                        wishes United States friendship” is an absolute and complete lie. The
                        attribution to the Department of State of “responsibility for withdrawing a
                        million Chinese troops from the war against Japan” and keeping China “back
                        from full unity in this war” is a deliberate distortion of truth: the
                        Department of State has encouraged the cause of unity in China; the
                        Department has at no time made any suggestions to the Chinese regarding the
                        distribution of their armed forces; and the Chinese themselves,
                        notwithstanding attempts by irresponsible outside parties to keep alive and
                        intensify points of disagreement between the Chinese Government and the
                        Chinese “Communists”, are unified in military operations in resistance to
                        Japan.</p>

                    <p>During the dinner given by the Generalissimo and Madame Chiang for Mr.
                            Willkie<note n="45" xml:id="d192fn45">Wendell Willkie, Republican
                            presidential candidate in 1940.</note> (October 3) I had an opportunity
                        for an extended talk with Mr. Foo Ping-sheung, Political Vice Minister for
                        Foreign Affairs. Regarding recent developments in Sinkiang Province, Mr. Foo
                        stated that the Russian reaction to an extension of central government
                        control to the province had been satisfactory, and gave two reasons for the
                        present Russian attitude. The Soviet Government realizes now that the policy
                        of penetration into Sinkiang was a mistake even as they found that the
                        policy which supported and encouraged the activities of Borodin<note n="46"
                            xml:id="d192fn46">Michael Borodin, Soviet agent in China,
                            1923–27.</note> and the Comintern in China during the twenties was a
                        mistake. (It is worthy of note that the Russian “penetration” into Sinkiang
                        during the thirties occurred at a time when central or Kuomintang government
                        influence in the province was virtually non-existent and that the character
                        of the penetration was largely economic and commercial; was not at the
                        expense of China proper in as much as trade relations and Chinese investment
                        were also virtually non-existent; and was beneficial to the inhabitants of
                        the province and to economic development.) The other reason is the
                        realization by the Soviet Government that, in the event of a Japanese attack
                        on Siberia, Chinese good will will be very helpful and that therefore the
                        amicable removal of possible sources of friction or misunderstanding is good
                        policy. (In this connection it is pertinent to recall Mr. Willkie’s comment
                        to the effect that Stalin had within recent weeks ceased to be especially
                        concerned with regard to a Japanese attack on Siberia.)</p>
                    <p>I asked Mr. Foo what he thought of the possibility of carrying the good start
                        made in Sinkiang further to reach a general basic understanding with Russia
                        regarding present problems and post war relations—something along the lines
                        of the Anglo-Soviet agreement in the event of a Japanese attack on Siberia.
                        Dr. Foo said it would be advantageous to have such an agreement, indicated
                        that he had long favored closer understanding between Russia and China, but
                        seemed to feel that it would be difficult of achievement. (He probably had
                            <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0256"/>in mind the strong, prevalent
                        belief in conservative and military circles that the Chinese communists in
                        Shensi Province are supported by Moscow and that Moscow would not withdraw
                        that support.) He expressed the opinion—similar to that expressed to me by
                        Dr. Kung several weeks ago—that America might be able to bring its influence
                        to bear toward effecting some basic understanding between China and Russia.
                        He agreed that such an understanding should precede the convening of a peace
                        conference.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Foo then made the rather startling statement that there was some feeling
                        that the Anglo-American combination was not being entirely frank with China.
                        He said that it was essential that complete confidence be maintained with
                        regard to plans and aims. I told him that I felt that America had made its
                        aims completely clear; that it could not undertake to speak for Britain; and
                        that I did not think there was any “Anglo-American” understanding hidden
                        from China.</p>
                    <p>The conversation then turned to the Foreign Office’s recent complaint to the
                        Embassy regarding articles in American magazines critical of China (Edgar
                        Snow’s article in the August 8 issue of the <hi rend="italic">Saturday
                            Evening Post</hi> in particular). I told Mr. Foo that the American
                        Government did not exercise control over expressions of opinion in the press
                        and that I felt he would agree with me that it would be undesirable for it
                        to attempt to do so. We placed a very high value on the freedom of the
                        press; the press was free to criticize the activities of the American
                        Government; and it would be unwise to exercise control over expressions of
                        opinion either on foreign or domestic matters except where military strategy
                        and operations were concerned. Mr. Foo agreed. He said that it had been
                        unfortunate that the American press during the months following Pearl Harbor
                        had been so fulsome in its praise of China; that this had misled Chinese
                        into thinking more of their role than was warranted; and that criticism now
                        came as a shock to many. He said what China needed and wanted was neither
                        praise nor criticism but American air support for its armies.</p>

                    <p>In my conversation with Mr. Chou En-lai, I first raised the question of the
                        alleged attack by Communist forces on General Yu Hsueh-chung, the commander
                        of Central Government troops in Shantung. <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247"
                            facs="0257"/>Mr. Chou asserted that there had been no Communist attack
                        on General Yu, but that certain dissatisfied elements among General Yu’s
                        Manchurian officers had mutinied. The mutiny, however, was not serious.</p>
                    <p>With regard to a reported worsening of relations between the Central
                        Government and the Communists and alleged demands made by the Government
                        that the Communists accept a position as one of several political parties,
                        abandon their administrative control over certain areas and disband their
                        armed forces or else expect punitive action, Mr. Chou remarked that to the
                        contrary relations appeared to have improved somewhat. He himself had
                        noticed no change in the attitude of the Central Government, but General Lin
                        Piao (Communist general now visiting Chungking) reported having been
                        agreeably entertained in Sian by General Hu Tsung-nan.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chou stated that no Central Government troops had yet entered Sinkiang,
                        but that three armies were in Kansu waiting to enter Chinese Turkestan. In
                        his opinion, Sinkiang can easily be taken over by the Central Government,
                        provided that the Government does not rush matters. He observed that
                        Sinkiang authorities were men of little ability. In reply to my question
                        about Soviet troops in Sinkiang, he declared that there were only some white
                        Russians and former Manchurian troops, plus, of course, the provincial
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>[Here follow observations on military situation and military
                        proficiency.]</p>
                    <p>You<note n="47a" xml:id="d193fn2">Reference is to General Stilwell, for whom
                            this memorandum was prepared.</note> may be interested, as a sort of
                        postscript, in some of Mr. Chou’s observations on the Generalissimo. He
                        proclaimed his loyalty to General Chiang, declaring that the Generalissimo
                        was not the leader of one party or faction but of the whole people. To my
                        question whether anyone spoke out his mind to the Generalissimo, he replied
                        in the affirmative. The Generalissimo answers such frankness in this
                        fashion, Mr. Chou explained. To the old and venerable he replies, “Your
                        heart is good, you are experienced, but you do not understand progressive
                        methods.” To the young enthusiast he replies, “Your heart is good, you
                        understand progressive methods, but you are without experience.” And to the
                        non-Kuomintang elements he says, “You have had experience, your method seems
                        to be progressive, but your motives are suspect.”</p>

                    <p>With regard to the specific “charge that it is on the advice of reactionary
                        officials in the State Department that Chiang Kai-shek is keeping his best
                        armies out of the war”, the simple fact is that the nearest approach to
                        “advice” given by any officials in the Department of State in this context
                        has been an expression of an opinion that civil strife in China, at all
                        times unfortunate, would be especially unfortunate at a time when China is
                        engaged in a desperate struggle of self-defense against an armed invader.
                        The implication of this expression of opinion was that the Chinese
                        Government should try to maintain peace by processes of conciliation between
                        and among all groups or factions in China. And, the course which Chiang
                        Kai-shek has been pursuing is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> “keeping his best
                        armies out of the war”. Both the armies of the National Government and the
                        “communist” armies are fighting the Japanese. No Chinese armies are actively
                        engaged in large scale offensive operations against the Japanese—for the
                        reason, principally, that there is lacking to all Chinese armies types and
                        amounts of equipment which are essential to such operations; but this
                        situation is one which both the Chinese Government and the American
                        Government are endeavoring to remedy as equipment becomes available.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the specific charge that “the State Department in Washington
                        has informed Chungking’s representatives that our Government would be <hi
                            rend="italic">displeased</hi> if complete unity was established in China
                        between the Kuomintang and the communists”, what this statement alleges is
                        the exact opposite of the fact. The State Department in Washington has at
                        all times taken the position, both in diplomatic contexts and publicly, that
                        the United States favors “complete unity” among the Chinese people and all
                        groups or organizations thereof.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the specific charge that “these officials continue the old
                        policy of ‘war against the communists’ in China”, this Government has had no
                        such policy, either “old” or new. This Government has in fact viewed with
                        skepticism many alarmist accounts of the “serious menace” of “communism” in
                        China. We have, for instance, as is publicly and well known, declined to be
                        moved by Japanese contentions that presence and maintenance of Japanese
                        armed forces in <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0259"/>China were and
                        would be desirable for the purpose of “combatting Communism”.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the specific charge that officials of this Government “tell
                        Chungking it must continue to fight the communists if it wishes United
                        States friendship”, the simple fact is that no officials of this Government
                        ever have told Chungking either that it must fight or that it must continue
                        to fight the “Communists”; this Government holds no such brief; this
                        Government desires Chinese unity and deprecates civil strife in China; this
                        Government treats the Government of China as an equal; it does not dictate
                        to the Government of China; it does not make United States friendship
                        contingent; it regards unity within China, unity within the United States,
                        unity within each of the countries of the United Nations group, and unity
                        among the United Nations as utterly desirable toward effectively carrying on
                        war against the Axis powers and toward creation and maintenance of
                        conditions of just peace when the United Nations shall have gained the
                        victory which is to be theirs.</p>

                    <p>The American Government has for a hundred years pursued a policy favoring
                        maintenance of the independence and the integrity of China. In pursuing this
                        policy, this Government has at all times believed it desirable that the
                        Chinese nation be and continue to be united. It has used its influence in
                        opposition to events, movements and trends directed or leading toward
                        disintegration, partitioning, break-up or subjugation of China. An
                        outstanding and accurate expression of this Government’s attitude was that
                        which was given in 1900 when President McKinley declared, “the policy of the
                        Government of the United States is to seek a solution which may bring about
                        permanent safety and peace to China, preserve China’s territorial and
                        administrative entity, protect all rights granted [<hi rend="italic"
                            >guaranteed</hi>] to friendly powers by treaty and international law,
                        and safeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with
                        all parts of the Chinese Empire.”<note n="53" xml:id="d196fn53">Department

                    </p>
                    <p>It has been this Government’s practice not to interfere in China’s internal
                        affairs. Officials of the American Government have developed and maintained
                        outstandingly cordial relations with officials of the Chinese Government,
                        both in official and in personal contacts. On rare occasions the American
                        Government has in an utterly friendly manner expressed to the Chinese
                        Government views relating to political situations and developments within
                        China. On every such occasion the expression of views has been in line and
                        in harmony with the broad principles of policy mentioned above. Believing in
                        the principle of Chinese unity because of its advantages to the Chinese
                        people, the Chinese state and the Family of Nations, and desiring that China
                        prosper and be strong and be able to preserve her independence, the
                        Government of the United States has deprecated civil strife in China and has
                        suggested conciliatory attitudes and procedures by and on the part of
                        contending groups or factions among the Chinese. At no time have we
                        suggested use of force by Chinese against each other, or use of force by
                        China for any purpose of aggression against any other country. At no time
                        have we made any suggestions to the Chinese regarding the distribution of
                        their armed forces.</p>
                    <p>The only suggestions which the Department of State or any of its officials
                        have ever made bearing in any way upon the relations between <pb n="251"

                        that armed force be used.</p>

                    <p>1221. The Third Peoples’ Political Council held its inaugural meeting on
                        October 22 with 204 delegates in attendance.</p>
                    <p>Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government, in address to Council expressed
                        belief that China was progressing toward democratic principles of Sun
                        Yat-sen but warned that attainment of democratic government must be gradual;
                        stated that with abolition of extraterritoriality<note n="57"

                        position higher and responsibilities and sphere of war action greater; and
                        that people must work together with government to enable China to fulfill
                        obligations as one of United Nations and to achieve its objectives.</p>
                    <p>Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek addressing Council stated China was the most
                        important member of forces fighting on continent of East Asia but was no
                        longer fighting alone; that China has already <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252"
                            facs="0262"/>passed from defensive to offensive; that Japanese [army?]
                        is now encountering reverses and difficulties and faces future of
                        uncertainty; that Soviet Russia has not relaxed her vigilance on Siberian
                        front; that collaboration between China and Great Britain, the United
                        States, Russia and other Allies has increased and financial and material
                        assistance to China has resulted therefrom, and that abolition of
                        extraterritoriality gives added responsibility to China which must assume
                        equally heavy share of war burden. He named four important points in present
                        situation: (1) defeat of Axis certain, (2) war will be long, (3) Allied war
                        production assures victory, and (4) post-war world will be one of equality
                        and freedom among nations; referring to action taken on economic front by
                        American Government and to lack of effective measures in China, enumerated
                        four points for guidance of Council: (1) prevailing tone of social life must
                        be changed and frugality emphasized, (2) prices must be stabilized, (3)
                        wartime financial policy must be founded upon direct taxation, subscription
                        to public loans, collection of land tax in kind and promotion of savings,
                        and (4) conscription of man power for military and labor service should be
                        supplemented by voluntary enlistment and prevention of evasion and abuse;
                        and concludes with appeal for awareness of responsibility on part of
                        government and people following promise of abolition of extraterritoriality
                        by Great Britain and United States.</p>

                        despatch no. 157 of September 25, 1941, and to enclose a copy of Daily
                        Bulletin no. 489 of November 3, 1942,<note n="59" xml:id="d199fn59">Neither

                        Control of Public Organizations.</p>
                    <p>Since its establishment in December, 1940, the Ministry of Social Affairs has
                        been very active in pursuing the program outlined in the enclosed bulletin.
                        To what extent organizations are in actual existence or exist simply on
                        paper the Embassy has not been able to determine.</p>
                    <p>As a wartime measure control such as planned by the Social Affairs Ministry
                        may be warranted although doubt exists that it has any appreciable effect on
                        the prosecution of the war. Rather it is generally viewed as part of the
                        program of the Kuomintang, and particularly <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253"
                            facs="0263"/>of the so-called “C–C” clique within the Party, to extend
                        party influence and organization into every phase of social life and thus to
                        strengthen the Party against the feared reaction that may set in after the
                        termination of the war against exclusive, conservative, Kuomintang control
                        of the government.</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, the cooperative enterprises and societies mentioned in the
                        bulletin are Party sponsored organizations not to be confused with the
                        Chinese Industrial Cooperatives. It is known, however, that the Ministry of
                        Social Affairs has been desirous of bringing the Chinese Industrial
                        Cooperatives under its control.</p>

                            It stated, among other things, that at some points “the situation has
                            been made worse by flood after a new opening of the dikes by the Chinese
                            army in an attempt (reportedly unsuccessful) to divert the Yellow River
                            so as to cut off the Japanese foothold established last Fall on the west
                            bank.” In conclusion, Mr. Service said: “There is as yet no indication
                            that an upheaval is near.… But the atmosphere of longing for peace and
                            of dislike of the government and army which are supposed to protect them
                            is unmistakable.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Conditions in Honan have been deteriorating for several years. Honan is a
                        front-line area in the Chinese war of resistance to the Japanese, who
                        threaten the province from the north, south and east. The farmers of Honan
                        have been required to produce food not only for the normal population but
                        for the large Chinese military forces stationed in the area. Now has come a
                        failure of the spring and summer crops. Taxation in kind and the
                        requisitioning of foodstuffs for military use have drained off most of the
                        20% crop of this year. As a result more than two million persons may starve
                        while some ten to eighteen million will be seriously affected. Lines of
                        transport into the province are limited and are being monopolized to move
                        supplies for the military. The Government was slow in recognizing the famine
                        situation in the province and there is, apparently, much complaint and
                        criticism by the people.</p>

                        are expected to continue for 2 weeks (to November 26) rather than for the
                        customary week or 10 days. Reports are being submitted regarding party,

                                reportedly impressed with organization and activity in the United
                                States to meet wartime economic problems. It is probable that a
                                Ministry (or super Ministry) of Economic Warfare (or economic
                                control or mobilization) will be organized. Many of the functions
                                now performed by the Ministries of Economics, Finance, Food and
                                Social Affairs would become centralized in new Ministry. The names
                                of several officials are mentioned as possible heads of new
                                Ministry: T. V. Soong and Chang Chun for instance, but Soong it
                                appears will continue as Foreign Minister and the Generalissimo does
                                not want Chang Chun to leave his present key post as Chairman of
                                Szechuan Provincial Government. General Chen Cheng, Chairman of
                                Hupeh Provincial Government and Commander of sixth war zone, is most
                                likely candidate. His position as a long time close confidant of
                                Generalissimo rather than any special qualifications in field of
                                economic organization and management recommends him for job. The
                                Generalissimo is no doubt sincerely anxious to strengthen economic
                                structure of country or at least to prevent further deterioration.
                                The past however is marked by so many ineffectual measures to meet
                                economic problems that one cannot but be skeptical regarding success
                                of new Ministry. When new Ministry comes into being, present
                                Ministry of Economic Affairs under Dr. Wong Wen-hao will be changed
                                to Ministry of Industry and Mining.</item>

                            <item>With regard to military affairs, it is understood that there is
                                agitation for a reduction in the size and an improvement in the
                                quality of the Chinese army. It is argued that such a move would
                                measurably reduce the budget (military expenditures represent about
                                70 percent of total expenditures) thereby retarding currency
                                inflation; would release men to meet shortage of agricultural
                                workers; and would not adversely affect Chinese military effort.
                                General Chen Cheng is the <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0265"
                                />advocate of such reorganization. General Ho Ying-chin agrees in
                                theory and recognizes immense “practical” difficulties. It is
                                doubtful that the issue will become an open one at the CEC or that
                                anything will be done along the lines suggested although it is
                                possible that Chen Cheng as head of the new Ministry might be able
                                to accomplish something.</item>

                    <p>The Third People’s Political Council devoted its discussions, interpellations
                        and resolutions primarily to economic and financial problems which were
                        stressed in the speeches delivered by the Generalissimo and by Dr. Chang
                        Po-ling as Chairman pro tern at the inaugural session. The Generalissimo’s
                        suggested program for an intensified control of commodity prices describes
                        the causes and effects of the commodity price situation and sets forth
                        remedial measures therefor: (1) the central direction of the price control
                        machinery shall be placed in the hands of the National General Mobilization
                        Committee and the <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0266"/>executive work
                        done through the various ministers, with particular attention to be given to
                        the creation of provincial and district price control machinery; (2) the
                        actual control shall consist of the imposition of price ceilings, the
                        control of commodities, the promotion of production, the restriction of
                        consumption, the improvement of transportation, intensification of currency
                        and credit control, the adjustment of taxes, the retrenchment of the
                        national budget, the mobilization of man power and the allotment of a
                        substantial appropriation for the price control work. The Council after
                        adopting the program suggested by the Generalissimo passed a resolution
                        approving the adoption of the report on the control and stabilization of
                        commodity prices submitted by the PPC Committee on Financial and Economic
                        Affairs. This report which supplements and amplifies the Generalissimo’s
                        program sets forth recommendations concerning the general principles to be
                        followed, the control machinery, the control measures and inspection and
                        reward and punishment.</p>
                    <p>Other matters to which the Council gave considerable attention were the
                        development of the Northwest and border regions, education (including
                        promotion of education among Moslems, Mongols and Tibetans), development of
                        industry, mining and communications and Overseas Chinese. The attention
                        devoted to Overseas Chinese is particularly significant embracing as it does
                        resolutions calling for rehabilitation of Overseas Chinese enterprises in
                        the South Seas after the war, governmental aid for such enterprises,
                        equality for all races in the South Seas, government instruction and
                        guidance for those Chinese going to the South Seas and promotion of Chinese
                        education in Malaya after the war. It should be noted that there is no
                        indication in the newspaper reports of the Council’s meetings of any
                        recognition of Chinese participation in the war nor is there any criticism
                        of the Chinese military effort. That is also true with respect to the
                        question of democratic government, for there seems to have been little or no
                        discussion of the elements of democracy or demand for constitutional
                        government. Dr. Wang Shih-chieh, Secretary-General of the PPC, states that
                        the Council passed a resolution calling for the speeding up of the
                        establishment of district councils, said by him to be the real basis for
                        representative government in China through their power of election of
                        members of the provincial assemblies. Dr. Wang also states that the Third
                        People’s Political Council was the most representative group ever elected to
                        membership and that the discussion and criticism of the Government’s policy
                        had been freer during the recently concluded session than during previous
                        sessions. This he ascribes to the fact that a majority of the delegates was
                        elected whereas in the past the majority had been appointed by the
                        Government. <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0267"/>Represented among those
                        delegates were nonparty engineers and professional men who were often
                        critical of the Government’s increasing encroachments upon the field of
                        private enterprise.</p>
                    <p>Transmitted herewith is also a memorandum of conversation with Dr. Wang
                        Shih-chieh concerning the Third People’s Political Council.<note n="64"

                    <p>News despatches of the Council’s proceedings gave little prominence to the
                        field of international relations, the announcement of the impending
                        abolition of extraterritorial rights by the United States and Great Britain
                        apparently having prevented wide discussion of such an objective. In this
                        connection, one resolution was passed pointing out to the Government the
                        necessity of the abrogation of all rights and privileges enjoyed by foreign
                        powers in China that contravene the principle of equality and another was
                        adopted requesting the government to draft a program for inviting Allied
                        capital and technical cooperation. The Embassy has been reliably informed
                        that Dr. T. V. Soong, at a session of the Council <hi rend="italic">in
                            camera</hi>, stated that he felt confident that the United States would
                        give to China after the war the necessary economic and financial assistance
                        for China’s reconstruction.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Wang Shih-chieh and General Wu Teh-chen, Secretary-General of the Central
                        Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, have informed the Embassy that there
                        is being prepared for transmission to the Embassy a compilation of certain
                        non-confidential reports of the proceedings of the Council which are not
                        being released for publication. The Embassy will forward such material to
                        the Department upon receipt thereof.</p>

                        over the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald Tribune</hi> Forum a message from
                        Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to the American people. A newspaper text of
                        the message is attached.<note n="67" xml:id="d204fn67">Not attached to file
                            copy of this document.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Among the points made in this message, the following are of interest:</p>
                    <p>1. China repudiates the idea of “leadership of Asia”, as such leadership
                        would mean a continuation of the authoritarian principles which have been
                        synonymous in Chinese minds with the domination and exploitation that China
                        has suffered in the past.</p>
                    <p>This declaration is significant. It is in keeping with the logic of China’s
                        position and its language is unequivocal; however, strict adherence to it by
                        China might be made dependent upon a later “effective organization of world
                        unity”, called for by Generalissimo Chiang. At the same time, the
                        declaration precludes the idea of a “leadership of Asia” by non-Asiatic
                        powers. A probable motive in making the declaration at this time is the
                        desire of the Chinese Government to forestall accusations that China aims to
                        supplant Japan in a dangerous overlordship of Asia.</p>
                    <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0269"/>
                    <p>Editorial comments in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> and the <hi
                            rend="italic">New York Herald Tribune</hi> recognize the importance of
                        this statement and both warmly acclaim it. The <hi rend="italic">Herald
                            Tribune</hi> remarks that Generalissimo Chiang’s repudiation of
                        imperialist nationalism and acceptance of some rational limitation upon the
                        concepts of untrammeled sovereignty is perhaps the clearest statement yet
                        made on this subject by any of the heads of the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>2. In appealing for a world order that will achieve the aims of the United
                        Nations, Generalissimo Chiang urges (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that its
                        organization be begun immediately and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) that it
                        embrace all the peoples of the world. His proposal that the principles of
                        justice for all peoples be applied without delay “among ourselves even at
                        some sacrifice” may be construed as referring to treatment not only of China
                        but of India as well. The note of immediacy in organizing a world order was
                        also sounded recently by Dr. T. V. Soong.</p>
                    <p>3. The message points out that the Chinese are democratic by instinct and
                        tradition and that, given the untrammeled opportunity, China will develop
                        democratic processes of government. It should be noted that, while social
                        democracy, equality of opportunity and rudimentary forms of local
                        self-government are traditional in China, our concept of government with the
                        consent of the governed is not native to China, nor have the democratic
                        principles of freedom of speech and assembly and the elective franchise been
                        generally operative there. It will probably be many years, even under
                        favorable conditions, before political democracy in our sense can be made an
                        actuality in China.</p>
                    <p>4. The promise of economic justice for the masses has a ring of sincerity,
                        aided by the candid admission that China has far to go before this objective
                        is achieved. However, growing criticism in many quarters of the failure of
                        the Chinese National Government to implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s social and
                        economic tenets, may be in part responsible for the renewed emphasis on
                        economic justice in the message. In addition, the Chinese Government thus
                        places itself in a more favorable position vis-à-vis the Chinese Communists,
                        whose proposals for concrete reforms have aroused sympathetic interest
                        abroad.</p>
                    <p>A further motive for the increased emphasis on democracy and economic
                        liberalism at this time might be the desire of the Chinese Government to
                        identify itself more closely with these principles in anticipation of the
                        expected weight they will have in the peace conference.</p>

                        to enclose for the information of the Department a copy of an item appearing
                        in <hi rend="italic">China Information Committee Daily Bulletin</hi> No. 515
                        of December 5, 1942 under the title “Sinkiang Calls”.<note n="70"

                    </p>
                    <p>It will be observed that the item reports that the problem of the development
                        of frontier regions, particularly Sinkiang, received special attention at
                        the Tenth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the
                        Kuomintang; and that the National Government currently intends to allocate a
                        large sum of money to finance the emigration of young technicians and
                        educators to Sinkiang; further, “The surplus staff of all government offices
                        will be encouraged to work in the Northwest and Sinkiang.” The item
                        indicates that 10,000 persons will be invited from the various training
                        corps and the Ministry of Education for migration to Sinkiang, each of whom
                        will be permitted to take with him a family of five at Government
                        expense.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lone Liang, chief of the Western European Department of the Foreign
                        Office, in a casual conversation with a member of the Embassy staff on
                        December 10, confirmed that the Government proposed to move some 10,000
                        surplus officials and others into Sinkiang as reported, most of them having
                        Tihua for their destination. Mr. Liang indicated that most of the concerned
                        officials would belong to the older group of public servants, and said that
                        the transfer had already begun. He stated that the Government was
                        appropriating a large sum of money for various economic projects in
                        Sinkiang, and that Chinese troops would also presumably be moved into the
                        province. Mr. Liang admitted that the problem of housing the new arrivals
                        upon their arrival in Tihua would be considerable.</p>

                            xml:id="pg_261" facs="0271"/>Committee of the Kuomintang, based on
                        reports and on subsequent conversations with Chinese officials:</p>
                    <p>The Central Executive Committee adopted some 20 resolutions, the most
                        significant of which were concerned with party organization and work,
                        military service, education, fiscal policy, industrial organization, labor
                        service, reconstruction, local self-government, commodity price controls,
                        and internal political solidarity.</p>
                    <p>The government spokesman selected for special emphasis (1) price control (he
                        admits administrative deficiencies and popular skepticism, but states that
                        Central Executive Committee was unanimous in determination to overcome
                        difficulties); (2) furtherance of local self-government and reconstruction
                        in line with Three People’s Principles and parallel with prosecution of war;
                        (3) national solidarity (he states that liberal attitude adopted towards
                        individuals and groups outside party creates opportunity for them to rally
                        under same banner with Kuomintang), and (4) external policy (Central
                        Executive Committee favored formulation of post-war policies during war and
                        advocated immediate world organization among United Nations).</p>
                    <p>The manifesto of the sessions singled out for special mention (1) close
                        relation of China’s regeneration to world rehabilitation and immediate need
                        for world organization to enforce peace and to insure prevalence of Three
                        People’s Principles with aim of saving not only China but world as well, (2)
                        acceleration of China’s war effort as a present responsibility, (3) programs
                        of local self-government and industrial construction as advocated by Dr. Sun
                        Yat-sen for realization of two principles of the people’s sovereignty and
                        the people’s livelihood, and (4) greater internal solidarity through
                        recognition by all elements soundness Three People’s Principles, through
                        discontinuance of discrimination and obstruction, and through respecting
                        opportunity of all to serve country.</p>
                    <p>Informed Chinese officials emphasize the significance of (1) the work done to
                        strengthen party control in local and national government, (2) the gesture
                        made toward the Communists and other dissident elements in the national
                        solidarity resolution, (3) the admission that China should accelerate its
                        military effort, and (4) the desire evidenced to meet economic difficulties
                        through price controls and improvement of fiscal policy.</p>
                    <p>In the Embassy’s opinion one of the principal objectives of the Kuomintang
                        leaders at this time is the strengthening of party control and it appears
                        that the December session bent its energies in that direction. Changes in
                        Government officials (Embassy’s 1455, December 8, 3 p.m.<note n="71"
                            xml:id="d206fn71">Not printed.</note>) indicates as much and discussions
                        with regard to party affairs are understood to have emphasized that
                        objective. Decisions <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0272"/>and measures
                        with regard to reconstruction, education, fiscal program, economic controls
                        and external policy are in large part prompted and gauged by the desire to
                        strengthen the party—are means to that end. The end of the party is to
                        remain in power; it recognizes in the present shaky economic situation and
                        in potential post-war developments a threat to that power. It follows the
                        normal course of bureaucracies. It seeks to remedy defects in its own
                        organization for control rather than to correct the basic defects in the
                        social and economic structures.</p>
                    <p>The resolution on national solidarity came as a result of General Chiang’s
                        remarks at one of the latter meetings of the CEC in which he pointed out
                        that there was some criticism from abroad of the lack of political unity in
                        China, that all elements should be given a chance to serve the nation and at
                        the same time some liberty to express their opinions provided they obeyed
                        the Government and did not create disturbances. Although the resolution was
                        interpreted by many foreigners here as a threat to the Communists “to be
                        good or else”, neither CEC nor Communist officials so interpret it. The
                        former see in it generous gesture toward the dissident groups and the latter
                        consider it an admission that the present is no time to precipitate civil
                        war. It may be interpreted encouragingly as a step to arrest all
                        deterioration of Kuomintang-Communist relations.</p>
                    <p>The resolution on fiscal policy advocates increased revenue, budgetary
                        retrenchment, absorption of floating capital through sale of bonds, equity
                        and simplification as guiding principles in imposing taxes, reformation of
                        management of state enterprises in order that both the National Treasury and
                        the public shall benefit, and reformation of local governments to enable
                        them to become financially independent of the National Government. The
                        resolution may be interpreted as critical of the Ministry of Finance but it
                        is doubtful that the Ministry is prepared to do much toward meeting the
                        criticism.</p>
                    <p>Renewed efforts at imposing economic controls envisage more centralized
                        administration and stabilization of commodity prices on the basis of rice
                        and salt prices. Some improvement in the situation is anticipated from these
                        measures’ but fundamental correction, by reason [of] fiscal policy, is
                        hardly possible due to administrative difficulties and the character of
                        responsible government officials.</p>
                    <p>From the standpoint of military activity, little can be expected from the
                        decision to accelerate China’s war effort. Besides being under-equipped, the
                        mass of the soldiers is sadly undernourished and hence in no condition
                        physically to engage in active military operations. There was talk of
                        effecting a radical reduction in the size of the army and improving the lot
                        and effectiveness of the remaining forces, but nothing came of it. Increased
                        cost of feeding and clothing soldiers even with a present inadequate manner
                        has actually brought <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0273"/>about a
                        reduction in the number of men in units but this reduction is not disclosed
                        by commanders who fear reduction in their allowances.</p>
                    <p>Summing up, it may be said (1) that politically the high leadership of the
                        Kuomintang has strengthened its control of the government and may be counted
                        upon to continue cooperation with the United Nations, (2) that economically
                        “stop gap” measures and an improvement in the fortunes of the United Nations
                        will probably prevent a dangerous situation from deteriorating into
                        collapse, and (3) that militarily the same type of resistance that has
                        obtained for several years will continue with no reasonable expectation of
                        offensive action. Five and one half years of war conditions have sapped
                        China’s vitality and the present government is not competent to do much more
                        than hold things together until peace. Whether it will be able to cope with
                        the many and difficult problems that will face it then will depend in large
                        measure upon the vision and ability of its leaders, neither of which is now
                        conspicuous in the Kuomintang high bureaucracy. Much anticipatory dependence
                        is being placed upon post-war aid and support from the United States and
                        Britain, but it will require a strong determination to effect internal
                        reforms if that aid and support is to be effective and unity and order are
                        to be maintained.</p>

                        the 10th Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, (2) the Communist Party’s reply
                        to the resolution, and (3) an editorial which appeared in the <hi

                        published in Chungking. In connection with the foregoing enclosures, the
                        Department may also wish to refer to the Embassy’s general evaluation of the
                        work of the C. E. C. contained in its telegram No. 1486 of December 12, 10
                        a.m.</p>
                    <p>When the C. E. C. resolution on Internal Solidarity and its final Manifesto
                        first appeared in public print in Chungking the reaction of many foreign
                        officials was one of alarm. They interpreted the resolution and the portion
                        of the Manifesto dealing with the matter of internal solidarity as a direct
                        threat to the Chinese Communists; that <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265"
                            facs="0275"/>“they had better be good or else”; and that being “good”
                        meant identifying themselves thoroughly with the Kuomintang. They felt that
                        there was little chance of the Communists agreeing to lose their identity
                        within the Kuomintang ranks, and that an outbreak of civil hostilities was
                        strongly indicated. From an initial reading of the resolution and Manifesto,
                        such a conclusion was not entirely unwarranted.</p>
                    <p>Conversations with various informed Chinese officials, however, revealed that
                        the situation was not serious; that in fact the resolution was prompted by
                        an intent to bring about a <hi rend="italic">détente</hi> in
                        Kuomintang-Communist relations. Dr. Quo Tai-chi, former Minister for Foreign
                        Affairs, who attended the C. E. C. meetings as a member, was quite surprised
                        at the foreign reaction and described the resolution as a friendly gesture
                        toward the Communists. Dr. Wong Wen-hao, Minister of Economics, who is also
                        a C. E. C. member, stated that the resolution was prompted by remarks made
                        by General Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang had at some length and with considerable
                        show of moderation reviewed the relations between the Kuomintang and the
                        Communists; had deplored the fact that these relations were not good, (that
                        they had in fact been the subject of some adverse criticism abroad); had
                        advocated tolerance permitting freedom of belief and speech; and had
                        concluded that there was a place for all to cooperate within the broad
                        framework of Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s Three People’s Principles for the salvation
                        of the country and under the authority of the National Government. It was
                        the elaboration of and the emphasis placed upon this final phrase in the
                        resolution that caused apprehension that trouble might be brewing. A Chinese
                        official present when Chiang made his remarks describes them as
                        statesmanlike but says they were not enthusiastically received by the large
                        majority of the party members.</p>
                    <p>Communist officials in Chungking have displayed little apprehension, either
                        before or after the adoption of the resolution, with regard to any early
                        open break in Kuomintang-Communist relations. General Chou En-lai, the
                        official representative in Chungking of the Communist Party, is not
                        concerned over the immediate future although he continues to believe that it
                        is a case of <hi rend="italic">when</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic"
                            >whether</hi> the Kuomintang takes forceful action to liquidate the
                        Communists. Chiang’s political wisdom, rather than any desire for
                        reconciliation with the Communists, will steer away from trouble for the
                        time being even though less wise party and military men might wish to have a
                        showdown now.</p>
                    <p>Of interest in connection with the general subject of Kuomintang-Communist
                        relations is the recent visit of General Lin Piao, a commander of Communist
                        troops, to Chungking to confer with the Generalissimo at the latter’s
                        request. General Lin states that he has been well received in Chungking but
                        is pessimistic regarding cooperation <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0276"
                        />between the Kuomintang and Communist forces. He tells the old story of no
                        supplies, blockade and general suspicion. He refers to recent fighting
                        between National Government troops and detachments of the “New Fourth” army
                        in the Hupeh–Honan–Anhwei border region and states that the National
                        Government, taking the position that the “New Fourth” army was ordered
                        eliminated in early 1941, refuses to discuss matters relating to that force
                        and is bent on its actual as well as theoretical elimination. He thinks that
                        the rank and file in and out of the Kuomintang favor cooperation but that
                        there are no strong elements capable of carrying out such a policy in the
                        face of present party opposition.</p>
                    <p>The aim and end of the high Kuomintang command is to strengthen party
                        control. It is understood that much of the work of the C. E. C. was devoted
                        to the attainment of this objective. A Chinese official, not a member of the
                        C. E. C., approving this policy of the C. E. C., said that it was necessary
                        and good that the Kuomintang increase its strength because it was the agency
                        to lead China to democracy and away from the dangers of communism. His views
                        are most probably representative of much of the thinking in party
                        circles.</p>
                    <p>It is a not uncommon phenomenon that the strength of an opposition party lies
                        more in the failures of the party in power than in any positive strength of
                        the opposition. This is true in the case of the Kuomintang and the Communist
                        party in China. Whatever strength the Communist party has derives more from
                        the failures of the Kuomintang than in any positive accomplishment on its
                        own part. Had the Kuomintang had the foresight to adopt simple effective
                        measures for agrarian reform, equitable taxation, and for promotion of home
                        industries along the lines of the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, for
                        example, it could have cut the ground from under opposition such as the
                        Communists represent. This could still be done but it is feared that the
                        present Kuomintang leadership, sterile in so far as social reform is
                        concerned, is incapable of altering its conservative course.</p>
                    <p>Kuomintang leadership sees in the present serious economic situation in China
                        a very real threat to its power. It endeavors to meet that threat by
                        strengthening its control over industries and commerce through monopolies,
                        over finance through centralized fiscal policy, and over education and
                        social organization through propaganda and placing Kuomintang officials in
                        key positions.</p>
                    <p>The Kuomintang leadership also sees in potential post-war developments a very
                        serious threat to its power. If, as seems well within the realm of
                        possibility, the Soviet army is largely instrumental in defeating Japanese
                        land forces in the Far East, liberal and radical groups in opposition to the
                        Kuomintang will be greatly strengthened; <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267"
                            facs="0277"/>strengthened to the point that (1) they will have to be
                        taken into the government on a cooperative basis for reform; or (2)
                        eliminated by force; or (3) allowed to control areas, probably in the
                        northwest and northeast of China, on a semi-autonomous basis. The obvious
                        course for the Kuomintang to follow is the first.</p>

                    <p>Below are offered some observations in regard to the question of undertaking
                        at this time negotiations with China looking toward conclusion of a new
                        treaty with China in which the United States would, <hi rend="italic">inter
                            alia</hi>, relinquish the extraterritorial rights which its nationals
                        possess in China by virtue of existing treaties.</p>
                    <p>After nearly five years of war between China and Japan, Japanese military
                        forces occupy a large part of China—that part in which is located a great
                        preponderance of American investment and, in normal times, American
                        population and trade and cultural interests.</p>
                    <p>China’s financial and economic structure is severely strained. Recent events
                        in the Pacific area have given emphasis to China’s achievement in fighting
                        stubbornly and avoiding annihilation of its armies in a long and unequal
                        struggle. The United States on its part has assisted China in many ways;
                        through purchase of silver, through loans, through Supplying war materials
                        on a lend-lease basis, through a military aviation expeditionary force and
                        lastly and recently through the extension of the enormous credit of
                        $500,000,000 on terms which make the credit practically a gift.</p>
                    <p>In consequence of a growing realization in the United States of the magnitude
                        of China’s achievement in resisting Japan, and in keeping with the American
                        impulse of generous appreciation there is natural inclination in the United
                        States to carry out at once all of the measures which can be thought of to
                        express our feeling of appreciation. The writer has heard the expression
                        “China has grown up”. There is a feeling that China should in all respects
                        be treated as an equal.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand there is danger that action on the part of the United
                        States toward expressing good-will and appreciation for China’s very notable
                        effort may spill over the level of appropriateness and good taste to the
                        detriment both of the interests of China and of <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269"
                            facs="0279"/>the United States. There would in fact seem to be some
                        evidence that this point may have already been reached. The American
                        Ambassador to China in his telegram no. 176, March 1, noon, 1942,<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d209fn2">
                            <hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_475">p. 475</ref>.</note>
                        reported that the Chinese Ministry of Finance is disappointed to find that
                        the recent huge credit made available to China by the United States was not
                        granted as an absolute gift in recognition of China’s contribution to the
                        war effort in general. The Ambassador reported that there is a perceptible
                        assumption on the part of Chungking officials and bankers that the credit
                        extended is compensation which was due to China for its past and present
                        resistance to Japan and for what the Chinese regard as our past and present
                        shortcomings. A prominent and intelligent Chinese banker was reported in the
                        telegram under reference to have expressed the opinion that the credit
                        extended by the United States to China was too easily obtained to be
                        appreciated or for its most effective use to be insured.</p>
                    <p>In this connection there should be constantly borne in mind and (in the
                        interest of healthy relations) upon appropriate occasions brought tactfully
                        but plainly to the attention of responsible Chinese officials the facts that
                        China has in its resistance to Japan been actuated solely by the instinct of
                        self-preservation; that it was this instinct of self-preservation under the
                        impact of events (and not any conscious purpose of assisting the United
                        States) that has dictated China’s course of action; that the immediate cause
                        of the involvement of the United States in the war was the refusal of the
                        United States to sacrifice a principle involving China’s interests; that the
                        interests of the United States render it desirable that China continue its
                        struggle against Japan; and that this mutuality of interest is the only
                        justification for expenditure by the United States Government of resources
                        of the United States in assisting China in China’s struggle against
                        Japan.</p>
                    <p>The most recent and most definitive assurances given by the United States to
                        China in regard to the question of treaty revision was in a note dated May
                        31, 1941 addressed by the Secretary of State to Mr. Quo Tai-chi<note n="3"

                                other countries, has long possessed in China by virtue of agreements
                                providing for extraterritorial jurisdiction and related
                                practices.”</p>

                    <p>No one can know at this time what conditions in China will be at the
                        termination of the present war. Up until the renewed outbreak of hostilities
                        in 1937 between China and Japan, China under General Chiang Kai-shek’s<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d209fn4">Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Chinese
                            Executive Yuan (Premier).</note> resolute leadership had made
                        considerable progress toward unification. At that time, however, General
                        Chiang was engaged in a controversy amounting to civil war with a large,
                        organized “Communist” group. The outside military pressure exerted by Japan
                        upon China a£ a whole has tended to keep the Chinese “Communists” and the
                        leading faction in the country under Chiang’s control from open conflict
                        with one another. After cessation of the present hostilities the pressure
                        toward cooperation between dissenting groups will be removed and large parts
                        of the country will probably be overrun by organized bands who are now known
                        as “guerillas”. It will be surprising if there does not ensue a period of
                        chaos in which the present government at Chungking or any other government
                        which may emerge will in all probability be able to exert only partial and
                        ineffective control.</p>
                    <p>Under the circumstances indicated in this memorandum it is believed that it
                        would be prudent and wise to stand for the present upon the statement of the
                        Secretary of State quoted above and to be guided by conditions which prevail
                        in China and which affect relations between the United States and China at
                        the termination of the present war. There is no popular demand at this time
                        in China for the revision of the treaty relations between the United States
                        and China and it is believed that initiative on our part now for such
                        revision would not be healthy or appropriate but would be taken by China to
                        indicate that we were “slopping over”.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, it is obvious that the feeling amongst many influential
                        Chinese is that extraterritoriality and other special foreign rights in
                        China must go at the end of hostilities. The special status of the
                        International Settlement at Shanghai will undoubtedly undergo modification
                        or even abolition. The Chinese may very possibly demand the retrocession of
                        Hong Kong (depending possibly upon the circumstances of Japanese ejection
                        therefrom). Foreign shipping in Chinese coastal and inland waterways may be
                        subjected to restrictions or may even be abolished.</p>

                                questions relating to the question of real property rights. This
                                Government will presumably desire to obtain for American nationals
                                the right to hold real property throughout China. Many of our state
                                laws forbid the holding of real property by Chinese nationals. A
                                formula on this subject was worked out in the treaty with Thailand,
                                signed November 13, 1937,<note n="7" xml:id="d210fn7">Treaty of

                        “that there is more to be lost than gained by abolishing extraterritoriality
                        now and that revision of the treaties in force between the United States and

                        hostilities in the light of conditions then prevailing”.</p>
                    <p>Among the principal considerations pro there may be mentioned the following:

                            <item>In this country there is coming more and more to the forefront the
                                idea that the present war is a people’s war; that the United States
                                and the United Nations are fighting not only for self-preservation
                                but also for human rights and decencies and for greater equalities
                                in the general political, economic and social system than have
                                heretofore prevailed. For years the American people have regarded
                                extraterritoriality and its related appurtenances as an anachronism.
                                This anachronism becomes more vivid against the background of a
                                growing popular conception of what we are fighting for.
                                Relinquishment of extraterritorial and other special rights would
                                thus be in line with and a manifestation of the war aims of the

                                rights until after hostilities cease would not be likely to
                                constitute for this Government a bargaining factor of
                                significance.</item>

                            <item>As a result of war conditions in China, the normal activities of
                                most Americans, at least in the principal centers of population
                                (which are under Japanese military occupation), have had to cease.
                                Those Americans, at least those who have left China or who will be
                                able to leave China, are making and will have to make readjustments
                                in their occupations. The extraterritorial system is bound to go.
                                There will undoubtedly be, after termination of hostilities, a
                                period of confusion and of unsettled conditions in China.
                                Notwithstanding that fact, it would seem sound to have American
                                activities in China after the hostilities establish and maintain
                                themselves under conditions indigenous to the country and under
                                conditions which will have a greater degree of permanence than any
                                conditions brought about—at best for a temporary period—by any
                                effort to retain extraterritorial or other special rights. Should
                                extraterritorial jurisdiction be retained in China for a period of
                                unsettled conditions likely to follow immediately upon termination
                                of hostilities,<note n="9" xml:id="d210fn9">Marginal notation by Mr.

                                to return to China and to resume to some extent the activities which
                                have been practicable under an extraterritorial system. Later, when
                                China would press for abolition of extraterritorial rights, such
                                Americans would protest and, when they had to yield to an inevitable
                                development, would have to make one more fundamental readjustment in
                                their activities. It would seem desirable not to envisage the

                        and other special related rights which its nationals possess in China are
                        easier to list than the considerations pro and at first glance may seem to
                        outweigh the considerations pro. However, in the opinion of the author of
                        this memorandum, the considerations pro are of a more substantial and
                        enduring character than those contra. While this immediate moment may not be
                        an opportune time for this Government to take an initiative along the lines
                        under discussion and while such an opportune moment may not arise at least
                        until we can see the outcome of the present consideration being given by the
                        British Government to the question of the status of India, it is recommended
                        that the Division of Commercial Treaties and Agreements and the Division of
                        Far Eastern Affairs set up a small committee to begin in strict confidence
                        preparatory work looking toward the drafting of a suitable treaty which
                        might be presented by this Government to the Chinese Government in the not
                        too distant future.</p>
                    <p>Note: It is believed that this Government would wish at an appropriate stage
                        to confer with the British Government.</p>

                    <p>I concur in the conclusion expressed by Mr. Adams “that there is more to be
                        lost than gained by abolishing extraterritoriality now”. I would not,
                        however, make the commitment which Mr. Adams makes regarding when the
                        question of revision “can more intelligently be undertaken”: the situation
                        may change before there comes “the termination of hostilities”.</p>
                    <p>I also concur in Mr. Hamilton’s recommendation that a small committee
                        (described) be set up “to begin in strict confidence preparatory work
                        looking toward the drafting of a suitable treaty which might be presented by
                        this Government to the Chinese Government [depending on developments]<note

                    <p>The considerations advanced (in both memoranda) contra taking definite action
                        of a conclusive character “now” seem to me substantially to outweigh the
                        considerations pro. The subject of our extraterritorial rights in China is
                        not at this moment vividly in the minds either of the Chinese or of our own
                        people. There is not at this moment special need for special action on our
                        part in support of Chinese morale or by way of conciliating the Chinese. I
                        see no good reason for us to “play this card” at this time. There may come a
                        time when we will need a card and when it would be advantageous for us to
                        have this card and opportune for us to play it. We should make such
                        preparations as would put us in position to move promptly and well if, when
                        and as occasion arises.</p>

                    <p>His Majesty’s Government have recently been considering the possibility of
                        initiating with the Chinese Government at an early date discussions for a
                        treaty providing for the abrogation of British extraterritorial rights in
                        China, which His Majesty’s Government have already announced their intention
                        of negotiating when peace is restored. Their original motive for considering
                        the initiation of such negotiations at the present moment was the feeling
                        that to do so might provide encouragement to the Chinese Government at a
                        difficult moment of the war. On second thoughts, however, the British
                        authorities have reached the conclusion that action of this kind at the
                        present juncture would be construed merely as the fruit of a sense of
                        weakness and that it would therefore be unlikely to produce the desired
                        effect. For this reason they consider that they must wait until the tide
                        begins to turn against the Japanese.</p>

                        <item>His Majesty’s Government and the United States Government have both
                            announced that they will negotiate the abolition of extraterritoriality
                            when peace is restored in the Far East, and the Chinese Government may
                            be content to leave the question in abeyance until then. If in the
                            meantime however the Chinese Government themselves decided to raise the
                            issue, the position would of course be different, and His Majesty’s
                            Government would certainly respond sympathetically.</item>

                    <p>The Secretary of State presents his compliments to His Excellency the British
                        Ambassador and refers to the British Embassy’s <hi rend="italic"
                            >aide-mémoire</hi> of April 25, 1942 informing this Government that the
                        British Government has recently been considering the possibility of
                        initiating with the Chinese Government at an early date discussions with
                        regard to the relinquishment of British extraterritorial rights in China,
                        that the British Government has concluded that the present time would not be
                        favorable for such a step but that if the Chinese Government itself should
                        raise the question the British Government would respond sympathetically.
                        Reference was made to the desirability of a parallel course of action being
                        followed by the Government of the United States and of Great Britain with
                        reference to this question and the hope was expressed that the United States
                        Government would be prepared to consult with the British Government in
                        regard to any initiative in this matter which the United States Government
                        might contemplate.</p>
                    <p>As the British Government is of course aware, it has been this Government’s
                        long-considered policy to move toward the full relinquishment of
                        extraterritorial and related rights in China. It will <pb n="278"

                            >aide-mémoire</hi> which the American Embassy at London handed to the
                        British Foreign Office on March 30, 1937, it was stated that this Government
                        had for some time been considering suggesting to the Chinese Government a
                        resumption of the negotiations in regard to extraterritoriality which had
                        been interrupted in 1931.<note n="21" xml:id="d215fn21">For correspondence

                        time since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese hostilities in 1937, this
                        Government has given thought to the question whether it might not be
                        desirable to enter into discussions with the Chinese Government for the
                        relinquishment of these rights before the return of peace. This Government
                        reached a conclusion in line with the view expressed by the British
                        Government that the present time is perhaps not the most opportune for
                        taking an initiative in the matter but that if the Chinese Government should
                        itself suggest that discussions be commenced this Government would meet the
                        suggestion in a receptive spirit.</p>
                    <p>This Government will continue to follow closely all factors in the general
                        situation which may bear upon this question and will expect to keep in
                        touch, as in the past, with the British Government in the hope that if it
                        should later appear to be desirable to initiate discussions with the Chinese
                        Government or if an approach should be made by the Chinese Government, the
                        Government of the United States and the British Government may with
                        advantage take parallel action. The Government of the United States would
                        appreciate receiving from time to time any further views in regard to this
                        question which the British Government may wish to communicate.</p>

                        <item>I mentioned to Lord Halifax that I had noticed Madame Chiang
                            Kai-shek’s recent articles in the press condemning extraterritoriality
                            and remarked that she fails to give this Government any credit for its
                            progressive and liberal policy in regard to extraterritoriality. As
                            articles by her on such subjects are virtually state papers, it might be
                            well for our representatives at Chungking to impress upon her advisers
                            that we are pledged to the relinquishment of extraterritoriality as
                            rapidly as might be permitted by circumstance and that these pledges
                            have been renewed specifically on recent occasions. The most recent
                            occasion, you will recall, was my exchange of letters of May 26 and 31,
                            1941, with Quo Tai-chi.<note n="22" xml:id="d216fn22">

                    <p>Mr. Clarke, who had just arrived in this country by air from London on a
                        short visit for the stated purpose of the establishment of contacts with Mr.
                        Hornbeck and Mr. Hamilton and the discussion of various matters of mutual
                        interest, called at the Department this morning, calling at the Division of
                        Far Eastern Affairs after having called upon Mr. Hornbeck.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Clarke stated that one of the matters he wished to discuss was the
                        question of the relinquishment of extraterritorial jurisdiction in China,
                        and he went on to set forth the position of his Government along the lines
                        of the British Embassy’s <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of April 25,
                        1942, on this subject. Upon mention of that <hi rend="italic"
                            >aide-mémoire</hi> by Mr. Atcheson Mr. Clarke said that he had not yet
                        seen it. Mr. Atcheson thereupon informed him of the substance of the
                        Department’s <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> to the British Embassy of
                        May 6, 1942.</p>
                    <p>There followed some general discussion of the subject during which Mr. Clarke
                        inquired whether we had obtained the impression that the Chinese might
                        shortly request or demand the abolition of extraterritoriality. Reply was
                        made to the effect that there had been no official intimation that such a
                        development might be in the offing, we <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280"
                            facs="0290"/>had of course taken note of Madame Chiang Kai-shek’s recent
                        magazine and press articles published in this country, there were a
                        considerable number of American writers and others who were exhibiting
                        active interest in the matter, and we should not be surprised if pressure
                        upon the Department to take action increased.</p>

                        giving some thought to the question whether it would be desirable to issue
                        at this time a declaration without any qualification that upon the
                        restoration of peace the United States would relinquish its extraterritorial
                        rights in China; also, as an alternative, whether it would be desirable to
                        take an initiative toward concluding a treaty with China which would contain
                        simply such a commitment. I said that we would be interested in knowing
                        whether the British Foreign Office had been giving thought to any such
                        procedure.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Clarke replied that he thought that no consideration had been given to
                        any such measure. He said that his own offhand reaction was that such a
                        measure, which he characterized as a “halfway measure”, would not be
                        advisable. He expressed the view that it would be likely to be open to the
                        same disadvantages at this time when so many military reverses have been
                        encountered in the Far East as the taking of an initiative toward
                        relinquishing extraterritorial rights <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi> at this
                        time. He expressed doubt whether a halfway measure would accomplish anything
                        constructive.</p>
                    <p>After Mr. Clarke had expressed his views as indicated I said that speaking
                        only for myself individually I also held views similar to those expressed by
                        Mr. Clarke.</p>

                    <p>3594. Personal for the Secretary. Eden<note n="24" xml:id="d219fn24">Anthony
                            Eden, British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</note> spoke to me
                        of the relinquishment of British and American extraterritorial rights in
                        China. <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0291"/>He is quite in accord with
                        us that the present is not an opportune time for either of our Governments
                        to take any initiative on the question and shares our feeling that any such
                        action if taken at this time, with the Allied military situation as it is in
                        the Far East, might be misinterpreted in China. He does feel, however, that
                        the advantages of joint consultation between our two Governments in the
                        event that the Chinese themselves raise the question or if conditions so
                        change as to make initiative seem to either Government desirable are of real
                        importance. He believes that parallel British and American action with
                        regard to the relinquishment of extraterritorial rights in China when the
                        time comes will constitute a symbol of unity and cooperation on Far Eastern
                        policy which cannot but prove helpful to both our countries and to China
                        itself. Eden understands from Ashley Clarke’s conversations in Washington
                        and the Department’s memorandum to the British Embassy of May 6 (strictly
                        confidential instruction No. 1437, May 30<note n="25" xml:id="d219fn25"
                            >Instruction not printed.</note>) that the Department shares his views.
                        He attaches such a degree of importance to the question that he has asked me
                        to cable you in the foregoing sense. I am in full agreement with him.</p>

                    <p>3199. Your 3594, June 29, 2 p.m. In the light of your telegram I have
                        reviewed the matter. In doing so I of course have had in mind the whole of
                        what I said in my letter of May 31, 1941, to the Appointed Chinese Minister
                        for Foreign Affairs, which was released to the press on May 31. This
                        Government favors and regards itself pledged to relinquishment of this
                        country’s extraterritorial rights in China. We would be prepared to make
                        such relinquishment at the earliest moment when it could be made with due
                        consideration for the immediately imperative common interests and objectives
                        of the several parties most concerned.</p>
                    <p>This Government has, as has the British Government, been giving continuing
                        study to this whole question. Our attitude continues to be that expressed in
                        the Department’s memorandum to the British Embassy of May 6, which attitude
                        I understand to be in general conformity with the British position. I call
                        special attention to the last paragraph of the memorandum of May 6. I shall
                        of course keep in <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0292"/>mind the views
                        expressed to you by Mr. Eden as reported in your telegram under reference
                        and the fact that Mr. Eden attaches special importance to the matter.</p>
                    <p>Please inform Mr. Eden of the foregoing.</p>

                    <p>4087. Department’s 3199, July 11, 5 p.m.</p>
                    <p>1. The Department’s study of the question of relinquishment of this country’s
                        extraterritorial and related rights in China has continued. In this study we
                        have of course taken into account the trend of public opinion in this
                        country. While there has been no strong concerted pressure upon the
                        Government to take action, it has been obvious from editorial comment and
                        from speeches by and letters received from interested persons that popular
                        sentiment in favor of action toward abolishing extraterritoriality is fairly
                        widespread. It is believed that any request by the Chinese Government for
                        abolition would receive strong support in the United States. In the light of
                        this and other factors, we are inclining to the view that, although this is
                        not an entirely opportune moment to take some affirmative steps in the
                        matter, it is doubtful whether any much more favorable occasion is likely to
                        occur in the near future. On the contrary, we might later, because of the
                        natural trends of political thinking in China as well as in this and other
                        countries, find ourselves in a position less advantageous than at the
                        present while the question of initiative is within our control.</p>
                    <p>2. In our examination of the whole problem we have, of course, endeavored not
                        only to consider the advantages and disadvantages of taking action but have
                        also given thought to the question of what means of initiating action would
                        be most effective and beneficial to all concerned in case decision to take
                        action should be made. In this connection our thought inclines to a
                        procedure and action as set forth in paragraph numbered 3 below.</p>
                    <p>3. A confidential approach to the Chinese Government along lines as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>The American and the British Governments have been giving continuing thought
                        to the question of relinquishment respectively of <pb n="283"
                            xml:id="pg_283" facs="0293"/>American and British extraterritorial
                        rights in China. They would both be pleased if they could find some
                        practicable step which might be taken at this time to clarify further the
                        fact that they favor the termination of extraterritorial rights and
                        practices in China and regard themselves pledged to give up the special
                        rights of that character which they now possess. They believe that such a
                        step would serve to delineate by additional particularization the general
                        framework of the relationship which will exist in the future between the
                        United States and China and between Great Britain and China, especially in
                        the post-war world. They believe also that it might be helpful to the
                        peoples of all three countries to have more precise information than is now
                        available with regard to the concepts and purposes of the three Governments
                        in reference to the question of extraterritorial jurisdiction. An orthodox
                        way of proceeding would of course be for the American and the Chinese
                        Governments and for the British and the Chinese Governments to enter into
                        negotiations for the conclusion of new treaties based on the best modern
                        international practices and conforming with the general norms in
                        international relationships, which treaties would supplant existing treaties
                        of special character and provide for the complete and final termination of
                        extraterritorial rights and for the substitution therefor of the usual
                        rights of trade and of establishment. Such a procedure would be in
                        conformity with and a practical manifestation of the principle to which the
                        American, the British, and the Chinese Governments are committed of
                        proceeding in international relationships by orderly process of negotiation
                        and agreement.</p>
                    <p>Up to this time the American Government and the British Government have made
                        no approach to the Chinese Government on this matter in view of the
                        statement on this subject contained in the letter of the Secretary of State
                        of May 31, 1941, to the appointed Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs and
                        of the like, and indicated, position of the British Government. A further
                        factor has been that the question of American and British extraterritorial
                        rights in China has not seemed to be a question of urgent practical
                        importance at this particular time when the main efforts of the United
                        States, Great Britain and China are necessarily directed toward achieving
                        military success in the war.</p>
                    <p>If the Chinese Government should feel that it is advisable that affirmative
                        action be taken now, the American and the British Governments would be
                        agreeable to entering immediately into negotiations with the Chinese
                        Government directed toward termination of extraterritorial and related
                        rights by and with the conclusion of new modern treaties. The modern
                        treaties which the American Government and the British Government have made
                        a practice of concluding <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0294"/>during
                        recent years are comprehensive documents covering a considerable variety of
                        subjects. While the provisions are in a sense fairly well standardized,
                        still the negotiation of such a treaty normally requires some months for
                        full interchange of views to the end that entirely satisfactory conclusions
                        agreeable to both parties may be arrived at. In view of China’s place in the
                        family of nations and of the complexity of modern international intercourse,
                        it is assumed that the Chinese Government would in principle also favor the
                        conclusion of such comprehensive treaties.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the fact that negotiation of this type of treaty would
                        probably not be completed for several months, the fact that the negotiations
                        are in process could probably not be kept confidential. The enemy
                        governments might be expected to seize every available opportunity to
                        criticize to their own advantage any delay in negotiations or any apparent
                        differing of views between the parties to the negotiations. While there is
                        not to be anticipated any undue delay or the emergence of important
                        difficulties, it is believed that the factors which have been mentioned need
                        to be taken into consideration.</p>
                    <p>In view of the circumstances as outlined above, the American and the British
                        Governments suggest that, in case the Chinese Government should feel that it
                        would be useful for some further step to be taken at this time, the American
                        and the Chinese Governments and the British and the Chinese Governments
                        might respectively immediately enter into negotiations for the conclusion of
                        brief treaties which would provide for the relinquishment by the United
                        States and by Great Britain of American and British extraterritorial and
                        related rights in China and for the adjustment of a few broad questions
                        which would arise upon and in connection with relinquishment of
                        extraterritorial rights. The negotiation of such a brief treaty would
                        probably take much less time than the negotiation of a detailed,
                        comprehensive treaty and would not incur the same risk of premature
                        publicity. Thus, the negotiation of a brief treaty would not be open to the
                        same disadvantages as the negotiation at this time of a comprehensive
                        treaty. Moreover, during a period of war and while the enemy is in temporary
                        military occupation of parts of China’s territory, there would arise some
                        doubt as to the practicality of endeavoring at this time to provide in a
                        treaty for detailed provisions covering all usual aspects of international
                        intercourse.</p>
                    <p>It is our thought that a brief treaty between the United States and China of
                        the type in mind would contain: <list>

                    <p>4. As part of the approach outlined in paragraph numbered 3 above, it is
                        suggested that the American Government and the British Government present to
                        the Chinese Government for consideration brief draft treaties as
                        described.</p>
                    <p>5. If any approach should be made to the Chinese Government, it might ensue
                        that the Chinese Government would, after consideration of various factors,
                        prefer that no action be taken in reference to this matter at this
                        particular time. It is also possible that an approach at this time might
                        cause the Chinese Government to press for immediate and final relinquishment
                        of American and British extraterritorial rights in China without waiting for
                        the negotiation of new treaties. While being aware of this possibility, our
                        present thought inclines to favoring the making of an approach.</p>
                    <p>6. Please communicate the foregoing to Mr. Eden and state that we should
                        appreciate receiving an early expression of the British Government’s views.

                    <p>4886. The Department’s views with respect to the relinquishment of
                        extraterritorial and related rights in China as set forth in its telegram
                        No. 4087 August 27, 2 p.m., were presented to the Foreign Office in a
                        preliminary conversation this morning. The first reaction of Ashley Clarke
                        was not unfavorable and he expressed appreciation of the Department’s
                        procedure in consulting the British Government. Mr. Eden will, of course,
                        desire to give the matter careful study. Ashley Clarke indicated that he
                        believed the British and ourselves view the general question of
                        relinquishment of extraterritorial rights in practically the same light. In
                        thinking out loud, however, he remarked that a short time ago both
                        governments had felt that the time was not opportune to raise the question
                        and he was wondering exactly what new elements in the situation had arisen
                        to cause us to change our view. We told him that we had no background other
                        than that contained in the Department’s telegram under reference but that
                        personally we imagined the slightly more favorable military situation, as
                        evidenced by the victory—to date—in the Solomon Islands, must have
                        constituted one element in the Department’s decision in addition to the
                        question of American opinion set forth in numbered paragraph 1 of the
                        Department’s telegram. With respect to the latter he indicated that the
                        contemplated action would probably meet with similar popular support in the
                        United Kingdom. While he did not pursue the point, it is the Embassy’s
                        feeling that if the Department is in a position to enlarge somewhat on the
                        reasons which have led it to conclude that the present is an apposite time
                        to take the initiative on this question it might be helpful. Incidentally
                        Clarke did not think there was much likelihood that the Chinese themselves
                        would raise the issue now, asserting that they had always taken the position
                        that extraterritorial rights already belonged to the dead past.</p>
                    <p>As to the suggested “brief treaty” procedure, he had no offhand comment other
                        than to say he would like to think about it.</p>

                    <p>4269. Your 4886, September 1, 8 p.m. As indicated in the Department’s 4087,
                        August 27, 2 p.m., a factor of some importance in reaching our conclusion
                        has been the trend of public opinion in this country favoring relinquishment
                        of American extraterritorial and related rights in China. Not only has it
                        been apparent that popular sentiment in favor of abolition of
                        extraterritoriality is widespread but that such opinion, not only in
                        non-official circles but also in official circles in addition to the
                        executive branch of the government has been gaining in strength, leading us
                        to believe that this trend will increase. We have also, of course, taken
                        into account Chinese opinion and a number of recent indications that General
                        Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese Government are adopting a more activist
                        attitude with reference to China’s foreign political relations. In addition
                        there has been, as mentioned in your telegram under reference, the
                        consideration that improvement has recently occurred in the military
                        situation in the Pacific and in China itself—in the latter case a favorable
                        aspect of the picture being the successful activities of United States Army
                        Air Force units. Also, we have felt that in general we should from time to
                        time dispose of as many outstanding questions as we consistently can. The
                        desirability of such action in regard to extraterritoriality has been
                        impressed upon us very recently by the arising in “Free” China of an
                        American court case involving alleged manslaughter which is a probable cause
                        of embarrassment to this Government.<note n="28" xml:id="d223fn28">On August
                            16, 1942, an American sergeant was fatally shot by an American civilian,
                            Boatner Rayner Carney, at Chanyi, Yunnan Province. The American Consular
                            Court at Kunming held a preliminary hearing of the case on August 31,
                            1942, and committed defendant for trial by United States Court for

                            General of the War Department appointed army officers to act as Special
                            Judge and Special Prosecutor for the case. The Court convicted Carney of
                            involuntary manslaughter. Correspondence on this case is not printed.

                    <p>We have accordingly come to the view that, as an ideal moment to take an
                        affirmative step in the matter is not likely to arise, the present is
                        probably as good a time as any, especially as the initiative still lies with
                        us. By taking an affirmative step now we should hope to accomplish three
                        principal objectives: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) some psychological and
                        political benefit to the cause of the United Nations which would be of
                        concrete assistance to China and thus tend to strengthen the determination
                        of that country in its war effort; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the wiping out

                        my opinion support proposal that we now surrender our extraterritorial and
                        related rights by a brief treaty such as outlined in telegram under
                        reference with provisions in only a few of the many questions which will
                        arise upon and in connection with relinquishment of such special rights.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the time is approaching when we should take initiative by
                        proposing treaty discussions but I strongly recommend that we seek
                        conclusion of comprehensive treaties to regulate future Sino-American
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>I have no doubt that China would be glad to accept proposal for a brief
                        treaty such as has been suggested with postponement to a later date probably
                        indefinitely of consideration non-comprehensive [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]
                        treaties. China at present is in a mood to receive; almost to demand; and
                        not to give or concede. There is a definite trend toward nationalization and
                        government monopolies. There is a disposition to consider the taking over or
                        suppression of established foreign interests in China, the natural
                        concomitant of relinquishment of extraterritorial and related rights. There
                        is openly expressed expectation that after war America will finance Chinese
                        reconstruction and rehabilitation and execution of grandiose schemes for
                        industrial and other expansion by Government not private loans and credits
                        for Chinese benefit and profit; loans secured only on China’s national
                        credit with little concern apparently as to their repayments.</p>
                    <p>There is no evidence of disposition to respect the principle of mutual
                        benefit in trade or other relations. This is not a healthy or <pb n="289"
                            xml:id="pg_289" facs="0299"/>satisfactory situation for future
                        Sino-American relations, and an over-generous policy at this time of first
                        surrendering extraterritorial and related rights and expecting later fair
                        and just treatment in general and trade relations would in my opinion be
                        fatal.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese should be brought to realize that in surrendering our special
                        rights we consider that China assumes obligations and responsibilities
                        toward American interests which must be recognized and met and that China is
                        under the obligation to do its share in placing Sino-American relations on a
                        satisfactory basis of mutual respect, consideration, benefit and profit. I
                        know of no more satisfactory means of bringing this about than to insist
                        that comprehensive treaties be negotiated to come into force with the
                        surrender of our special rights.</p>
                    <p>Unless such treaties exist upon the termination of hostilities there will be
                        long delay and great uncertainty before satisfactory trade and other
                        relations can be established. After the war China will undoubtedly face
                        difficult domestic problems. The opportunity for the successful negotiation
                        of comprehensive treaties likely will not be found during that period but if
                        such treaties can be settled now we may be able to participate promptly and
                        effectively in Chinese rehabilitation and reconstruction with some
                        reasonable assurance as to the settled basis of our relationship and with
                        mutual benefit. The existence of basic foreign treaties might also be a
                        stabilizing influence in the reestablishment and organization of the Chinese
                        Government after the war.</p>
                    <p>The negotiations of such treaties would, of course, require delay; but that
                        delay would also be found after the termination of hostilities. Possible
                        attempts of our enemies to exploit any delay for purposes of propaganda
                        would be readily answerable in the abundant evidence of conditions in the
                        occupied areas and the existing relations between our enemies and their
                        puppet regimes in those areas.</p>
                    <p>I am concerned that in the outline of proposed brief treaty there is no
                        suggestion that such treaty would be accompanied by a protocol or other
                        understanding providing reasonable minimum safeguards for our nationals and
                        their interests when they come under Chinese jurisdiction. I do not suggest
                        that we can expect to obtain all safeguards contemplated in the
                        understanding which was about to be initialed in 1931,<note n="30"

                        that we can properly expect a declaration of a minimum of essential

                        treaty, the Embassy at Chungking has no files or treaty texts permitting of
                        detailed examination, but the following comments are believed to be
                        pertinent:</p>
                    <p>As to paragraphs (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) it
                        seems to be that we have a moral if not a legal obligation in agreeing to
                        the surrender of international settlements to Chinese administration to
                        insure that there will be just and equitable arrangements in regard to the
                        obligations of the former international administrations; and not the
                        obligations to Americans alone. At Shanghai particularly there are
                        substantial municipal assets to be taken into consideration.</p>
                    <p>This may not be a matter for inclusion in the treaty, but an arrangement
                        should be reached before we agree to surrender of the areas.</p>
                    <p>In connection with our right under the Boxer Protocol it has been my
                        impression that title to our Embassy property at Peiping is derived through
                        that protocol. That title should be protected. The Generalissimo has told
                        diplomatic representatives that he contemplates that ultimately the capital
                        of China will be moved back to Peiping; at that time our Embassy
                        establishment there will be important to us.</p>
                    <p>As to paragraph (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>), new deeds replacing leases in
                        perpetuity should be of equal tenure and it would be well to provide that
                        there shall be no restrictions on sale or transfer of properties whether in
                        the ports or in the interior. There has been some indication in recent years
                        that Chinese local authorities claim that mission property cannot be sold
                        but may be reclaimed by the local authorities at the original purchase price
                        when no longer desired for mission purposes.</p>
                    <p>In paragraph (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>), the reference to “areas closed for
                        reasons of national security” might be availed of unduly to restrict foreign
                        residence and trade arbitrarily. Careful study of the wording of such a
                        paragraph is suggested.</p>
                    <p>There have recently arrived in the United States from China a number of
                        foreign service officers of long practical experience in the field in China,
                        familiar with the details and background of China problems. I suggest that
                        these officers could contribute substantially in the detailed study of our
                        treaty relations with China before being reassigned to the field.</p>

                        information and will communicate the views of the Dominion Governments as
                        soon as they are communicated to Mr. Eden and forwarded by him to me.</p>

                        the subject of extraterritorial and related rights in China.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom agree that, while the present
                        time is not altogether opportune to raise this question with the Chinese
                        Government, it is doubtful whether any much more favourable occasion is
                        likely to occur in the near future, and they see considerable advantage in
                        acting while the initiative in the matter still rests with the powers
                        possessing extraterritorial rights. His Majesty’s Government cordially
                        welcome therefore the United States Government’s proposal that steps should
                        now be taken by the United States Government and His Majesty’s Government in
                        cooperation to arrive at a settlement of this question; and subject to the
                        concurrence of His Majesty’s Governments in the Dominions, whose views are
                        being obtained without delay, they will be glad to prepare in consultation
                        with the United States authorities a brief draft treaty on the lines
                        suggested, for presentation to the Chinese Government when the time arrives
                        to make the joint approach contemplated by the United States Government.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile His Majesty’s Government agree that it would be desirable to limit
                        action at present to the conclusion of a brief treaty dealing only with the
                        abrogation of extraterritorial rights and the related questions referred to
                        in the State Department’s communication. They are impressed with the
                        disadvantages set out by the State Department of negotiating a comprehensive
                        treaty of establishment and commerce while hostilities are in progress, and
                        they strongly <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0302"/>incline to the view
                        that if any such suggestion is advanced by the Chinese Government the two
                        Governments should insist on the larger question being postponed until the
                        end of the war.</p>
                    <p>A further point relates to Shanghai, which in view of the vast extent of
                        United States and British commercial interests centered there, appears to
                        present a special problem. His Majesty’s Government have reason to believe
                        that while the Chinese Government would require the return of the whole area
                        to unfettered Chinese rule they would be ready to grant Shanghai a special
                        status to enable the development of the port to continue with the
                        cooperation of foreign commercial interests. It is considered important
                        therefore that the proposed treaties should not preclude the United States
                        Government and His Majesty’s Government from pressing for this special
                        status at the peace settlement; possibly some mention of this question might
                        be included in the treaties.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would be glad if the foregoing
                        could at once be communicated to the United States Government with an
                        expression of thanks for the courtesy with which the proposal has been
                        transmitted to them. The United States Ambassador will be informed of the
                        views of His Majesty’s Governments in the Dominions as soon as they are
                        received.”</p>

                        <item>We have read with interest the British Foreign Office’s memorandum
                            quoted in your telegram under reference, and are gratified that the
                            views of the British Government so closely parallel those of this
                            Government. We have been working on a draft treaty of the kind described
                            in paragraph 3 of the Department’s 4087, August 27, 2 p.m., which
                            delineates our thought in regard to this aspect of the question, and
                            when the draft is completed we will expect to transmit a copy to the
                            British Government. Please so inform Mr. Ashley Clarke and Mr.
                            Eden.</item>

                        <item>Please ask Mr. Ashley Clarke informally to be so good as to let us
                            have some elaboration of the British thought in regard to the question
                            raised in the British memorandum of seeking a special status for
                            Shanghai. It is suggested that you say that, as indicated in previous
                            communications from the Department, we have had in mind, in connection
                            with the relinquishment of extraterritoriality and related rights, the
                            complete wiping out of all rights of a special character. <pb n="293"
                                xml:id="pg_293" facs="0303"/>We have felt that such action would
                            best serve the collective interests involved, whereas any holdover from
                            the existing anomalies in our relations with China would constitute a
                            further problem and a continuing source of friction. It seems to us
                            doubtful that the Chinese would be agreeable to continuing or creating
                            any special status for Shanghai. However, as indicated in the first
                            sentence of this paragraph, we should be interested in having an
                            elaboration of the British thought on this point.</item>

                            that it is highly desirable that the fact that the question of
                            extraterritorial jurisdiction in China is under consideration be kept

                    <p>5159. For the Secretary and the Under Secretary. We asked Ashley Clarke if he
                        could elaborate on what the British had in mind with regard to a “special
                        status” for Shanghai (Department’s telegram 4423, September 12, 9 p.m.). He
                        was not very specific but did tell us of a recent Chinese “suggestion”.
                        About a month ago, he said, Wang Ping Shen<note n="33" xml:id="d227fn33"
                            >Presumably Wang Peng-sheng, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek’s leading
                            adviser on Japanese affairs and head of the Institute for International
                            Relations, National Military Council.</note> in conversation with a
                        member of the British Embassy staff at Chungking indicated that the Chinese
                        recognized that there were many problems requiring settlement in Shanghai
                        and that they would be prepared to agree to some “special status” for that
                        city. No effort was made by the British to draw out their informant for fear
                        of encouraging some undesired Chinese initiative in the matter of
                        extraterritorial and related rights. It is the Foreign Office feeling
                        however that the Chinese would not of course consider any continuance of
                        international control over the administration of Shanghai or any system of
                        international police, et cetera (nor is such control in British opinion
                        desirable), they do believe that the Chinese would be prepared to have
                        certain foreign advisers participating in the proceedings of the future
                        Shanghai municipal authorities. The Foreign Office considers that there
                        would be <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0304"/>some advantage in such an
                        arrangement and that it would help in settling the many questions which will
                        inevitably have to be settled with the transfer of power from the
                        jurisdiction of the international (and French) concession administrations to
                        the Chinese. It is their belief that the Chinese realize they will need help
                        in settling such matters and that consequently to this end they too will
                        feel that such foreign advisers will be useful. As an example of the sort of
                        question which will have to be settled, Clarke and Dening<note n="34"
                            xml:id="d227fn34">Maberly Esler Dening, of the Far Eastern Department of
                            the British Foreign Office.</note> cited the Shanghai Power Company
                        which is American-owned. What, they asked, for example would be its future
                        status, its obligations to furnish power and the position of its debentures
                        owned not only by American and British holders but by other foreigners? We
                        gather that the Foreign Office feels that this and many similar problems
                        will have to be worked out in one form or another by mutual agreement with
                        the Chinese and their anxiety at the present time is merely to avoid
                        inclusion of any specific provision in the proposed brief treaty which would
                        completely tie our hands with respect to Shanghai.</p>
                    <p>Clarke describes Wang Ping Shen as a sort of head of China’s “Secret Foreign
                        Office” and attributes to him great personal influence with the
                        Generalissimo. The Foreign Office therefore, it is clear, sets great store
                        by his expression of willingness to recognize a “special status” for
                        Shanghai. They think that when the time comes for a British and American
                        approach to this question it will be possible to find out just what the
                        Chinese have in mind.</p>
                    <p>As to numbered paragraph 3 of the Department’s telegram under reference, the
                        Foreign Office is in accord that British and American consideration of the
                        question of the relinquishment of extraterritorial rights should be kept
                        strictly confidential. They do propose however to inform the British
                            Ambassador<note n="35" xml:id="d227fn35">Sir Horace James
                            Seymour.</note> at Chungking in strict confidence and in this connection
                        asked whether Ambassador Gauss has likewise been told of our proposal. They
                        believe that it would be useful for the two Ambassadors to consult together
                        but do not wish to suggest this if Gauss has not been informed. We gather
                        that the Foreign Office intends to ask the British Ambassador how many of
                        the stipulations included in the British draft treaty of 1931<note n="36"

                            been informed with regard to this matter in strict confidence. He has
                            indicated that he would favor the conclusion of comprehensive treaties
                            rather than brief treaties. We are telling him that the British

                            that it favors limiting action at present to the conclusion of brief

                        <item>The British Government has informed us that it concurs in our general
                            views upon the question of relinquishment of extraterritorial rights and
                            that it is of opinion that it would be desirable to limit action at
                            present to the conclusion of brief treaties of the type which we
                            described.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The British Government suggested that it felt that it would be
                            possible and desirable to arrange for some special status for Shanghai.
                            In requesting an elaboration of the British views in this matter, we
                            indicated that we felt that the wiping out of all rights of a special
                            character would best serve the collective interests of all involved. The
                            British Government has explained that it envisages possibly an <pb

                            specific provision in the proposed treaties which would tie its hands
                            with respect to Shanghai.</item>

                            Government’s desire to terminate the system of extraterritorial

                            action in reference to the question of relinquishing extraterritorial
                            rights in China at this time has been to show an initiative on the part

                    <p>Mr. Hornbeck asked Sir George Sansom to call.</p>
                    <p>In reply to inquiry Sir George said that he was familiar with recent
                        developments relating to discussions between the British Foreign Office and
                        the Department on the subject of American and British extraterritorial
                        jurisdiction in China. He mentioned that his latest information was that the
                        British Government had referred the matter to the British Ambassador at
                        Chungking with a request for the Ambassador’s comments. Mr. Hornbeck and Mr.
                        Hamilton then explained that there had been a number of subsequent
                        developments. Sir George Sansom was given to read a copy of the text of the
                        draft treaty which the Department had telegraphed to the American Embassy at
                        London for communication to the British Foreign Office.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hornbeck and Mr. Hamilton stressed that they had not asked Sir George to
                        call for the purpose of discussing details but in order to give him our
                        general political concept in which there figured largely the time element.
                        It was emphasized that we desire to keep the initiative in the hands of the
                        American and the British Governments <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0312"
                        />and that in the light of that fact it seemed important to us that we
                        proceed promptly in making approaches to the Chinese Government. It was
                        pointed out that this would be, in our opinion, advantageous from the
                        short-swing as well as the long-swing point of view in the relations of the
                        United States and of Great Britain with China.</p>
                    <p>Sir George Sansom said that he personally felt that it would be unwise in any
                        treaty with the Chinese giving up extraterritorial jurisdiction to attempt
                        to include many restrictive provisions designed to safeguard American or
                        British interests. He thought that such an attempt would nullify the
                        beneficial psychological effect which we were attempting to create.</p>
                    <p>Sir George said that he would send a brief telegram to the British Foreign
                        Office reporting his understanding of our general reasoning in the matter
                        from the broad-gauge, political point of view. Mr. Hornbeck and Mr. Hamilton
                        said that they thought that such action would be helpful.</p>

                    <p>5573. For the Acting Secretary of State. Your 4818, October 3, 10 p.m. This
                        evening I received the following communication from Mr. Eden together with a
                        suggested notification to the press for publication in the morning papers on
                        October 10 both of which are annexed below.…</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Begin Mr. Eden’s communication.</p>
                        <p>“His Majesty’s Government have considered the proposals of your
                            Government contained in the enclosures in your letter of October 5th
                            regarding the abrogation of extraterritorial rights and privileges in
                            China.</p>
                        <p>With the general purport of these proposals I am happy to be able to tell
                            you that His Majesty’s Government are in wholehearted agreement. They
                            would only reserve to themselves the right to propose certain amendments
                            to the treaty, but these would be of a purely drafting nature and would
                            involve no substantative change. His Majesty’s Government would however
                            have to include in their treaty an additional article covering the
                            rendition of the British concessions in Tientsin and Canton.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Ambassador at Chungking has suggested that we might try to
                            secure, in connection with the treaty, an exchange of notes containing
                            additional assurances concerning the treatment of our <pb n="303"
                                xml:id="pg_303" facs="0313"/>nationals after the abolition of
                            extraterritoriality. His Majesty’s Government would hope to discuss this
                            later with the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>In regard to procedure, I note that your Government contemplates a
                            confidential communication of our intentions to the Chinese Governments
                            We think that there would be great advantage in publicity at this stage.
                            It would seem desirable to proclaim the important decision we have
                            taken, which at this moment will meet with a considerable degree of
                            approval amongst our own peoples. Moreover it may be expected that
                            publicity for our decision would enhance its value in Chinese eyes.
                            While complete secrecy during the period of negotiation of the treaty
                            might be desirable from the point of view of avoiding public controversy
                            we should be very doubtful whether in fact we could rely on the Chinese
                            keeping the matter secret for any considerable period of time.</p>
                        <p>If these assumptions are correct, there would seem to be every advantage
                            in giving immediate publicity in a form that is acceptable to the two
                            Governments, and, if the United States Government accept this argument,
                            we should attach great importance to concerting a joint declaration to
                            be issued by the two Governments as soon as may be after the decision is
                            communicated to the Chinese Government. The Chinese National Day
                            (October 10) might offer a suitable occasion.</p>
                        <p>In the hope that the United States Government may agree with these
                            proposals, I enclose a draft of such a declaration for their
                            consideration.”</p>
                        <p>End Mr. Eden’s communication.</p>
                        <p>Begin suggested notification to press.</p>
                        <p>“His Majesty’s Government and the United States Government have declared
                            in public pronouncements that they were prepared at the conclusion of
                            hostilities in the Far East to negotiate with the Chinese Government for
                            the abrogation of the extraterritorial rights and privileges hitherto
                            enjoyed by their respective nationals in China.</p>
                        <p>In order to emphasize their friendship and solidarity with their Chinese
                            Allies His Majesty’s Government and the United States Government have
                            lately been in consultation regarding the relinquishment of these rights
                            and privileges at the earliest possible date.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the understanding reached between the two Governments
                            a communication was made to the Chinese Chargé d’Affaires in London and
                            to the Chinese Ambassador in Washington on the 9th October indicating
                            that the two Governments hoped in the near future to open discussions on
                            the subject with the Chinese Government and to present for their
                            consideration a draft treaty for the immediate relinquishment of the
                            rights and privileges in question”.</p>

                    <p>1. We are gratified to learn of the British Government’s wholehearted
                        agreement with the general purport of the proposals made in our telegrams
                        under reference and that it is prepared to make the suggested approach to
                        the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>2. On October 9 we shall therefore inform the Chinese Ambassador—and the
                        Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs,<note n="44" xml:id="d235fn44">T. V.
                            Soong.</note> who is also now in Washington—in the general sense
                        suggested in our telegram 4818, and we understand that the British Foreign
                        Minister will make a similar statement to the Chinese Chargé in London on
                        behalf of the British Government. We shall also inform the Chinese
                        representatives here that the brief draft treaty which this Government
                        envisages would provide for the relinquishment of American extraterritorial
                        and related rights in China, for the settlement of questions which would
                        otherwise arise as a consequence of such relinquishment during the period
                        prior to the conclusion of a comprehensive modern treaty of friendship and
                        commerce, and for the negotiation at a mutually convenient time of such a
                        comprehensive modern treaty.</p>
                    <p>3. With regard to the question of public announcements by the American and by
                        the British Governments, we appreciate the considerations set forth in your
                        telegram and we are in accord that announcements would be desirable.
                        However, we consider that joint announcements might carry an implication of
                        pressure upon the Chinese Government by the British Government and
                        ourselves. Consequently, we believe that individual announcements by this
                        Government here and by the British Government in London would be preferable
                        to joint announcements by the two Governments. The text of the announcement
                        which this Government therefore plans to issue on October 10 reads as
                        follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                the willingness of this Government, when conditions should be

                            <p>On October 9 the Acting Secretary of State informed the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs of China and the Chinese Ambassador in Washington
                                that the Government of the United States is prepared promptly to
                                negotiate with the Chinese Government a treaty providing for the
                                immediate relinquishment of this country’s extraterritorial rights
                                in China and for the settlement of related questions, and that the
                                Government of the United States expects in the near future to
                                present to the Chinese Government for its consideration a draft
                                treaty which would accomplish the purpose mentioned.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States has during the past several weeks
                                exchanged views with the British Government in regard to this
                                general question and the Government of the United States is
                                gratified to know that the British Government shares this
                                Government’s views and is taking similar action.”<note n="47"

                    <p>We assume that the British announcement will take a similar form. We regret
                        that there is not sufficient time for us to confer with the British

                        9 that in view of the Chinese national anniversary we have in mind making on
                        October 10 a public announcement.</p>

                    <p>5605. For the Acting Secretary. My 5599 of October 8, 1 p.m. I have just
                        received a note from Mr. Eden stating that he agreed with the procedure
                        proposed and sending the text of a notification which the British will make
                        to the press for publication in the morning papers on October 10. He
                        mentions that the British Government has taken note of the arrangements for
                        publication which we suggest and will act in conformity with them. The
                        British are also instructing the censor not to allow any cables on this
                        subject to leave this country even with a release hour until 2 a.m., October
                        10 and trust we will take similar measures.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Office states it would appreciate it if the Department, when
                        telegraphing the text of the draft treaty to our Ambassador at Chungking,
                        could request him at the same time to show the draft to his British
                        colleague.</p>
                    <p>The following is the suggested notification to the press for publication on
                        October 10: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“His Majesty’s Government have declared in public pronouncement on
                                the 14th January 1939, the 16th July 1940 and the 11th June 1941,
                                that they were prepared at the conclusion of hostilities in the Far
                                East to negotiate with the Chinese Government for the abrogation of
                                the extraterritorial right and privileges hitherto enjoyed by their
                                respective nationals in China. Similar pronouncements have been made
                                by the United States Government with whom His Majesty’s Government
                                have been in consultation.</p>
                            <p>In order to emphasize their friendship and solidarity with their
                                Chinese allies, His Majesty’s Government have now decided to proceed
                                further in this matter at once. Accordingly, the Secretary of State
                                for Foreign Affairs made a communication to the Chinese Chargé
                                d’Affaires in London on the 9th October indicating that His
                                Majesty’s Government hoped in the near future to open discussion
                                with the Chinese Government and to present for their consideration a
                                draft treaty for the immediate relinquishment of extraterritorial
                                right and privileges in China and for the settlement of questions
                                intimately connected therewith.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty’s Government have recently been engaged in an exchange of
                                views with the United States Government on this question. They have
                                been pleased to learn that a similar communication was made by the
                                United States Government on the same day to the Chinese Ambassador
                                in Washington and the fact that the two Governments have found it
                                possible to take similar action in this important matter has
                                occasioned lively satisfaction in London.”</p>

                                clear on a number of occasions. During recent months this Government
                                has been considering whether a treaty which would give immediate
                                effect to this policy might not be negotiated between this

                                in China, for the settlement of questions which would otherwise
                                arise as a consequence of such relinquishment during the period
                                prior to the conclusion of a comprehensive modern treaty of
                                friendship and commerce, and for the negotiation at a mutually
                                convenient time of such a comprehensive modern treaty. This
                                Government consequently expects in the near future to present a
                                draft brief treaty of the nature indicated to the Chinese Government
                                for its consideration.</p>
                            <p>“In view of the occurrence tomorrow of the Chinese national
                                anniversary, we have in mind making a brief public announcement at
                                nine o’clock this evening so that news in regard to the matter may
                                be carried in the morning newspapers of October 10.</p>
                            <p>“This Government is regarding this matter as strictly confidential
                                until public announcement is made and requests that the Chinese
                                Government also so regard it until that time.</p>
                            <p>“It is understood that the British Government is today informing the
                                Chinese Chargé in London of the views of the British Government on
                                this subject which are believed to be similar to the views of <pb
                                    n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0318"/>this Government and that
                                the British Government will also make an appropriate public
                                announcement.</p>
                            <p>“It is requested that the Chinese Ambassador be so good as to inform
                                his Government by urgent, confidential cable that the Government of
                                the United States is prepared promptly to negotiate with the Chinese
                                Government a treaty along the lines set forth in the second
                                paragraph and that this Government expects in the near future to
                                present a draft of such a brief treaty to the Chinese Government for
                                its consideration.”</p>

                    <p>After reading the statement, Mr. Welles handed it to the Ambassador. Mr.
                        Welles then said that it gave him a great deal of gratification to make this
                        communication to the Chinese Ambassador. Mr. Welles added that, as the
                        Ambassador was aware, this Government in 1931 had made known to the Chinese
                        Government in discussions which were then occurring its desire to proceed
                        toward relinquishment of this country’s extraterritorial jurisdiction in
                        China. Mr. Welles recalled that these discussions were interrupted by
                        Japan’s aggression in Manchuria. Mr. Welles referred also to other occasions
                        when this Government had made known its attitude in the matter. Mr. Welles
                        repeated that it gave him a great deal of gratification to communicate to
                        the Chinese Ambassador this Government’s present thought in the matter,
                        which it is believed would also be pleasing to the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Ambassador said that this represented a great step in the happy
                        relations between our two countries. He said that he would immediately
                        report the matter to his Government.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador inquired when Mr. Welles thought that this Government would be
                        in position to present to the Chinese Government for its consideration the
                        draft of the treaty referred to. Mr. Welles replied that he thought that
                        this would be done in no longer than a week.</p>

                    <p>5658. For the Acting Secretary. Thank you very much for your 4934, October 9,
                            noon.<note n="51" xml:id="d240fn51">Not printed.</note> After receiving
                        your 4938, October 9, 6 p.m., I contacted Mr. Eden, who was out of London,
                        by telephone. He wanted me to say that the British announcement was very
                        well received here. He tells me, however, that the British have very large
                        interests in China which will be affected by the treaty agreement and that
                        it would be very helpful to him if he could have a fortnight to talk to
                        those concerned rather than cutting the time for consideration of drafts to
                        one week. He is most anxious that British action and our action be
                        undertaken on a common time table.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Soong called at his initiative on Mr. Hornbeck and Mr. Hamilton, who, in
                        order to save Dr. Soong’s time, received Dr. Soong together.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong said that he had wished to call before leaving on a trip to China.
                        He said that he planned to depart from Washington on Thursday.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong said that he had received a telegram from Generalissimo Chiang
                        Kai-shek asking Dr. Soong to call on the Secretary of State and to express
                        appreciation of this Government’s action on October 9 in reference to the
                        question of extraterritoriality. Dr. Soong referred <pb n="310"
                            xml:id="pg_310" facs="0320"/>to the fact that the Secretary of State was
                        away and said that he had an appointment to see Mr. Welles tomorrow to
                        express to him the Generalissimo’s appreciation.</p>
                    <p>When Dr. Soong made initial reference to the question of extraterritoriality,
                        Mr. Hornbeck smilingly asked (having previously been authorized by Mr.
                        Welles to mention such matter very informally and casually) why Dr. Soong
                        did not stay in Washington to assist in negotiation of the treaty abrogating
                        American extraterritorial jurisdiction in China. Dr. Soong at first seemed
                        to give serious consideration to this query and asked whether Mr. Hornbeck
                        thought it would be all right for him to suggest to the War Department that
                        the War Department, which was making a plane available to Dr. Soong for the
                        trip, postpone the departure of the plane for a week or so. Mr. Hornbeck
                        pointed out that we of course could give no guarantee as to how long the
                        negotiation of the treaty might take, but that it had occurred to us that it
                        would be nice if Dr. Soong were here to assist in the matter. Mr. Hamilton
                        mentioned that Dr. Soong had signed the tariff treaty of 1928<note n="53"
                            xml:id="d241fn53">Signed at Peking, July 25, 1928, <ref

                        extraterritoriality treaty might have served to round out the picture. Mr.
                        Hornbeck said that of course with Dr. Soong in Chungking he could assist in
                        the matter at that end, and from this point the conversation proceeded on a
                        basis of tacit assumption that Dr. Soong would leave on Thursday as
                        planned.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong raised a number of questions in regard to the scope of the proposed
                        treaty. To these questions Mr. Hornbeck and Mr. Hamilton commented to the
                        effect that we had not at this moment worked out everything in precise
                        detail; that we did not expect that the proposed treaty would cover
                        completely every question; that we were, however, taking a very big step;
                        that some questions, especially those of detail, could probably be taken
                        care of to better advantage at some subsequent time; that we were
                        concentrating on the question of consular jurisdiction and what related to
                        it; that we planned to present a brief treaty rather than a long, detailed
                        one; and that we were attempting to include broad basic items with regard to
                        which no controversial matters would be likely to be presented and which
                        would be generally supported in both our countries.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong inquired when we thought the draft would be ready for presentation
                        to the Chinese Government. Mr. Hornbeck referred to the fact that the Acting
                        Secretary had informed the Chinese Ambassador last Friday that we hoped to
                        have the draft ready within a week. Mr. Hornbeck added that, as Dr. Soong
                        knew from his practical experience, <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0321"
                        />no absolute guarantee as to time could be given in any such matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong in his whole approach was very friendly, appreciative, and
                        understanding. As he left he expressed his adieus and Mr. Hornbeck and Mr.
                        Hamilton extended their good wishes to Dr. Soong for a pleasant, safe, and
                        profitable trip to Chungking.</p>

                    <p>1160. Following for the President from Generalissimo.</p>
                    <p>“On the occasion of the thirty-first anniversary of the Republic of China the
                        entire nation rejoiced that the United States has made a voluntary move to
                        relinquish extraterritorial rights in China. Furthermore, the ringing of the
                        Liberty bell in Independence Hall to commemorate China’s Liberty Day finds
                        resounding echoes in every Chinese heart of good will and friendship for
                        America. These tributes will do more to uphold the morale of our people in
                        continuing resistance than anything else could possibly do. I personally am
                        so deeply moved by this beautiful and touching gesture that I cannot find
                        words adequate to express my feelings. As a boy the very words ‘liberty
                        bell’ and ‘Independence Hall’ fired my imagination and made a profound and
                        lasting impression in my mind. Throughout my struggle to secure national
                        freedom for China I have continuously dreamed of the day when she would
                        assume the full stature of an independent and democratic nation. Today this
                        ideal has been realized. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for your
                        superb and inspired leadership and moral courage in assisting China to gain
                        equality among the United Nations. I assure you that China shall not fail
                        you in our joint task of securing freedom for all mankind. Chiang Kai
                        Shek.”</p>

                    <p>1169. Announcement United States Government of its intention to negotiate
                        with China for immediate relinquishment of extraterritorial rights in China
                        enthusiastically received in all Chinese circles. The Generalissimo at mass
                        meeting celebrating double tenth stated <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312"
                            facs="0322"/>that abolition of unequal treaties means fulfillment of one
                        of Sun Yat Sen’s aims that Chinese people should redouble efforts to build
                        nation worthy of being member of United Nations and expressed appreciation
                        of Chinese people for ringing of liberty bell on such historic occasion.</p>
                    <p>Local press issued extras carrying announcement and editorially acclaimed the
                        action stating that it was appropriately timed to coincide with celebration
                        of China’s independence from Manchu rule, that the move will further
                        strengthen already cordial relations between China and the United States and
                        Great Britain, equal partner of United Nations, that action will serve to
                        reassure all nations of genuineness of intentions underlying Anglo-American
                        policy and that such a step will be a blow to Japanese propaganda efforts.

                        <item>We appreciate the British Government’s desire to give full and careful
                            consideration to various aspects of this important matter. As you know,
                            we told the Chinese Ambassador on October 9, in reply to his inquiry,
                            that we would expect to present a draft text to the Chinese Government
                            within a week. We made this statement, which is not necessarily
                            categorical, in consideration of the Ambassador’s obvious desire for
                            early action and of the fact that our preliminary draft had been
                            formulated after careful study, and had received the British
                            Government’s agreement in principle. As public expectation in this
                            country, in Great Britain, in China, and elsewhere has been aroused, and
                            for other reasons, we feel that it is urgently desirable to proceed
                            rapidly.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>We doubt the desirability of attempting to have included in the brief
                            treaty or in accompanying exchanges of notes matters of detail or
                            provisions which would be restrictive in character.</item>

                            time.</item>

                    <p>Dr. T. V. Soong, Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs, called to see me today
                        to say goodby. The Minister said he would attend the Conference of the Party
                        Executive Committee to be held in Chungking next month and that he would
                        probably remain in China during the month of December in order to get
                        thoroughly in touch with all developments in his own country, and that he
                        would then return to Washington in January.</p>
                    <p>The Minister spoke with the greatest enthusiasm regarding the announcements
                        of this Government covering the relinquishment of extraterritorial rights by
                        the United States in China. He said that nothing had given greater
                        satisfaction to Chiang Kai-shek, and that the latter had an almost
                        sentimental feeling with regard to this issue inasmuch as it was one of the
                        points specifically mentioned in the last will of Sun Yat-sen. He said that
                        he would have liked to remain in Washington to sign the first treaty
                        himself, but that on account of the date fixed for the holding of the party
                        assembly and the difficulty of transportation facilities, he did not feel
                        warranted in postponing his departure.</p>

                            <p>Begin note. “With regard to the draft treaty covering the abrogation
                                of extraterritorial jurisdiction in China which you sent me in your
                                letter of the 5th October and the comments contained in my
                                preliminary reply of the following day, I send you herewith a
                                memorandum containing some suggested amendments for the
                                consideration of your Government and some indications of the points
                                on which additional provisions will be required in the British
                                treaty to cover, for example, the rendition of the British
                                concessions at Tientsin and Canton.</p>
                            <p>I should be grateful if you would note that these observations are
                                subject to the views of the Governments of the Dominions and India
                                and may therefore be modified in the light of the consultation which
                                    <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0324"/>is now taking place.
                                But in view of the intention of your Government of which you
                                informed me on the 10th October to hold themselves in readiness to
                                present their treaty to the Chinese within a week, I have thought it
                                best to let you have at once our views even though in provisional
                                form.</p>
                            <p>you will, I know, understand that while it was possible to consult
                                the Governments of the Dominions and India on the principle of the
                                abolition of extraterritoriality and obtain their replies in a very
                                short time, a breathing space is now required to allow these
                                governments to consider carefully the terms of a treaty which,
                                although brief and drawn in somewhat general terms, will have an
                                important bearing on the treatment of our respective peoples both
                                now and in the future. While therefore it is not essential that His
                                Majesty’s Government and the United States Government present their
                                draft treaties to the Chinese simultaneously, it would be greatly
                                appreciated if the United States Government could in fact postpone
                                the presentation of the treaty for a further week or two until the
                                observations of the Dominions and India have been obtained”. End

                    <p>Begin proposed amendments and suggestions. “Subject to the comments and
                        suggestions made below and to the results of consultation with the
                        Governments of the Dominions and India which is now taking place, His
                        Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would be ready to sign with China
                        a treaty following <hi rend="italic">mutatis mutandis</hi> the draft treaty
                        enclosed in Mr. Winant’s letter of October 5th.</p>
                    <p>1. His Majesty’s Government attach importance to the following points:</p>
                    <p>Article III. At the end of paragraph 2 His Majesty’s Government suggest that
                        the last two or three lines should run as follows. ‘And will make provision
                        for the assumption of the official obligations and liabilities of those
                        settlements and for the recognition and protection of all legitimate rights
                        therein.’ It is desired by the addition of the word ‘liabilities’ to cover
                        in particular the liabilities of the settlements as regards pensions to
                        their employees.</p>
                    <p>It should also be explained that the Municipal Council of the International
                        Settlement at Shanghai (and perhaps also at Amoy, though this is not
                        certain) has vested municipal assets in the hands of trustees for the
                        purpose of securing the due discharge of certain municipal obligations such
                        as loan debenture issues and pensions for the municipal staff. In order to
                        safeguard the creditors of the respective councils in this respect, His
                        Majesty’s Government would be grateful if the United States Government would
                        consider adding the following sentence to article III: ‘It is understood
                        that where the obligations and liabilities of municipal councils of these
                        settlements are secured upon assets in China, the security and the existing
                        rights of the holders of the obligations to enforce the security will be
                        maintained.’</p>
                    <p>Article IV. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would like to
                        draft the end of the paragraph as follows:</p>
                    <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0325"/>
                    <p>‘Except upon proof, established through due process of law, that such rights
                        have been acquired by fraud or as the result of confiscatory action during
                        the Japanese occupation, in which case the property shall be restored on
                        such terms as justice shall require to its previous owners.’</p>
                    <p>Article V. His Majesty’s Government would desire to add a sentence running as
                        follows: ‘In all legal proceedings and in all matters relating to the
                        administration of justice, the levy of taxes or requirements in connection
                        therewith and the carrying on of commerce, nationals of His Majesty in China
                        and nationals of China in the territories of His Majesty shall enjoy
                        treatment not less favourable than that accorded in those territories to
                        nationals of China or nationals of His Majesty as the case may be. In this
                        provision the expression “nationals of His Majesty’s” includes companies
                        incorporated under the law of any of His Majesty’s territories and the
                        expression “nationals of China” includes companies incorporated under
                        Chinese law. The right to carry on commerce shall only be restricted in time
                        of war and national emergency and then shall only be subjected to such
                        restrictions as are necessary in the interests of national security and
                        which are imposed upon all foreigners.’ His Majesty’s Government in the
                        United Kingdom attach much importance to this addition providing for
                        national treatment in the administration of justice, taxation and the
                        carrying on of commerce.</p>
                    <p>Article VII.</p>
                    <p>1. His Majesty’s Government would suggest the insertion of the word
                        ‘navigation’ after the words ‘friendship, commerce’ and before the words
                        ‘and consular rights’.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty’s Government attach great importance to ensuring that pending the
                        conclusion of comprehensive modern treaties of commerce, etc., at a later
                        date all those provisions of the existing treaties which are not
                        inconsistent with the present jurisdiction treaty shall remain in force.
                        This is doubtless the intention of article VII of the American draft, but in
                        order that there should be no room for ambiguity on the subject, it is hoped
                        that the United States Government may be able to agree to the amendment of
                        the second paragraph of that article on the following lines:</p>
                    <p>‘Pending the conclusion of a comprehensive treaty of the character referred
                        to in the preceding paragraph, all provisions of the existing treaties,
                        conventions or agreements between the high contracting parties shall remain
                        in force insofar as they are not inconsistent with the present treaty. If
                        any questions affecting the rights in the territory of the Republic of China
                        of the nationals of (His Majesty) (including corporations or associations)
                        should arise in future and if these questions are not covered by the
                        previous treaties and agreements <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0326"
                        />above mentioned which are not inconsistent with this treaty, such
                        questions shall be discussed by representatives of the two governments and
                        shall be decided in accordance with generally accepted principles of
                        international law and with modern international practice.’</p>
                    <p>2. The following are minor points mainly of a drafting nature:</p>
                    <p>In Article I of the American draft treaty His Majesty’s Government suggest
                        that the words ‘which shall be exercised’ should be inserted in the last
                        sentence after the words ‘Republic of China’ and before the words ‘in
                        accordance with.’ The object of this amendment is to obtain an undertaking
                        from China that they will exercise their jurisdiction in accordance with the
                        principles of international law and practice.</p>
                    <p>Article II. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have no comments
                        on the text of the article. But they would be glad to learn whether it is
                        the intention of the United States Government to preserve any subsequent
                        agreements relating to the disposal of the American share of the Boxer
                        Indemnity.</p>
                    <p>Article VI. His Majesty’s Government would suggest to the United States
                        Government the desirability of including in their draft of article VI
                        express provisions giving consular officers the right to visit within the
                        limits of their districts any of their nationals who are in prison, under
                        arrest, or awaiting trial and stating that communications from nationals in
                        prison to their consular officers will be forwarded to them by the local
                        authorities.</p>
                    <p>It will be necessary in the British treaty to make the appropriate
                        definitions of the territories and the nationals of His Majesty to which the
                        treaty will apply. Further, it will be necessary to cover the rendition of
                        the British concessions at Tientsin and Canton.</p>
                    <p>3. In addition to proposals already made as regards the text of the treaty
                        itself, His Majesty’s Government would suggest that the Chinese Government
                        should be invited to give certain assurances regarding the treatment of our
                        nationals after extraterritoriality has been abolished. These it is hoped
                        would be of a nature to facilitate our everyday relations with the Chinese
                        Government in jurisdictional matters and would help to avoid
                        misunderstandings and disputes. A suggested draft of such a note from the
                        Chinese Government is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>‘With reference to the treaty concluded between us today, I have the

                                to judicial and other matters, namely,</p>

                                reference to extraterritoriality. That step is one which this
                                Government and I personally have long wished to take, and it is
                                especially gratifying that it could be synchronized with so
                                auspicious a day as China’s national anniversary when your country
                                celebrates the founding of the Republic and honors the principles of
                                freedom. We greatly admire the telling blows for freedom which China
                                has struck against the aggressor in Asia, and we are wholly
                                confident that our two countries in association with our other
                                comrades-in-arms will move forward together to complete victory.

                    <p>5129. Your 5752, October 15, 1 a.m. We are glad to have the proposed
                        amendments and suggestions of the British Government and <pb n="318"
                            xml:id="pg_318" facs="0328"/>we appreciate the expedition and the spirit
                        of helpful cooperation with which those suggestions have been presented.</p>
                    <p>The Department’s comments with regard to the British amendments and
                        suggestions, following the order set forth in your telegram under reference,
                        are as follows:</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Article III. With regard to the suggested change
                        at the end of the second paragraph, we are agreeable to the change.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the suggestion that there be added to Article III an
                        additional sentence, we are not sure that we understand precisely what the
                        British Government has in mind and would therefore appreciate clarification.
                        Does the British Government have in mind by the suggested additional
                        sentence only assets which are presently in being or does it have in mind
                        such assets plus a continuing obligation to apply future revenues to meet
                        such obligations and liabilities, or does the British Government have in
                        mind providing simply as a principle that the rights which the holders of
                        the obligations now have to appropriate process of enforcement would
                        continue to be recognized under Chinese law? In this connection, the
                        Department observes that in drafting we endeavored to phrase Article III, as
                        other articles of the draft treaty, in broad general terms. Article III as
                        drafted by us envisages possible future discussion of certain types of
                        questions which may after this treaty is concluded arise.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Article IV. We do not perceive the relevancy to
                        the subject matter of the article of the reference to confiscatory action
                        during Japanese occupation. In our draft we have endeavored to provide for
                        regulation of the relations between American nationals and the Chinese
                        Government in regard to property rights as affected by relinquishment of
                        extraterritorial jurisdiction. We have not endeavored to deal with questions
                        arising as a result of Japanese occupation which in our view are in a wholly
                        different category from the subject matter of this treaty. On the basis of
                        our understanding of the suggested British amendment we therefore feel it
                        advisable to retain the original language of this paragraph.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Article V. The suggested British addition covers
                        matters which from our point of view might more appropriately be taken care
                        of in the comprehensive treaty which we envisage negotiating with China at
                        some subsequent time. It might also in the form proposed raise for us
                        difficult questions relating to Federal and State jurisdictions. With regard
                        to the last sentence of the suggested British addition, the American
                        Ambassador at Chungking has pointed out that mention of a right to impose
                        restrictions on the basis of war and national emergencies is open to the
                        danger that the Chinese Government might interpret such a provision much
                        more broadly than other governments <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0329"
                        />are likely to do. We are therefore reluctant to include in our draft the
                        British suggestion. We are, however, continuing our study of the British
                        Government’s suggestion under reference. The subject matter of the
                        suggestion might of course be brought up by any of the interested parties,
                        including the Chinese, after the drafts of treaties have been presented to
                        the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Article VII. We accept the suggested addition of
                        the word “navigation”.</p>
                    <p>The British interpretation of the intention of Article VII of the American
                        draft is correct. While we perceive no strong objection to the rephrasing as
                        a whole suggested by the British Government, we deliberately drafted the
                        second paragraph of this article with a view to avoiding emphasis on
                        provisions of existing treaties, conventions, or agreements, in as much as
                        those treaties, conventions, and agreements are associated in the popular
                        mind and in the mind of the Chinese Government with the concept of “unequal
                        treaties”. We would therefore hope that upon reconsideration the British
                        Government would adopt our original phrasing.</p>
                    <p>We do not understand why the British Government in its rephrasing omits
                        reference to rights of this Government and of the British Government
                        respectively. We believe it advisable to retain mention of rights of
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>We like the suggested British substitution in the body of the paragraph under
                        reference for the words “as a consequence of the relinquishment of
                        extraterritorial rights” of the words “in future” and are making this
                        change.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) Article I. With regard to the suggested insertion
                        of the words “which shall be exercised”, we deliberately drafted this
                        statement in general terms. We feel that the insertion of the suggested
                        words would be likely to offend Chinese susceptibilities and to cause the
                        Chinese Government to ask that this sentence stop with the words “the
                        Republic of China”. We therefore do not favor the insertion of the words
                        suggested.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) Article II. It is not the intention of the
                        Government of the United States to preserve any subsequent agreements
                        relating to the disposal of the American share of the Boxer Indemnity.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) Article VI. It seems to us that the points made in
                        the first paragraph of the British suggestions are covered substantially in
                        our draft. In addition, we would find it difficult to omit the words “upon
                        notification to the appropriate authorities” in as much as we have included
                        those words in recent treaties with other countries. However, in the light
                        of the British suggestions we are amending our draft as follows: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>In the second sentence of the first paragraph of our draft we are
                                altering the second and third clauses to read as follows: “they <pb
                                    n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0330"/>shall be informed
                                immediately whenever nationals of their country are under detention
                                or arrest or in prison or are awaiting trial in their consular
                                districts and they shall, upon notification to the appropriate
                                authorities, be permitted to visit any such nationals; and, in
                                general, the consular officers of each country shall be accorded, et
                                cetera”.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>After the last sentence of the article and as part of the last
                                paragraph we are adding a sentence “Communications to their consular
                                officers from nationals of each country who are under detention or
                                arrest or in prison or are awaiting trial in the territory of the
                                other country shall be forwarded to such consular officers by the
                                local authorities”.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">h</hi>) (1) With regard to paragraphs numbered 1 and 2 in
                        the suggested note from the Chinese Government, the Department feels that
                        the Chinese Government would be likely, on the ground that the making
                        thereof would be a limitation on Chinese sovereignty, to object to a
                        suggestion that it make such statements. The adoption of such a suggestion
                        would also serve to continue in existence in agreements between China and
                        foreign countries provisions for the making of distinctions between the
                        treatment accorded in China to Chinese nationals and to foreign nationals.
                        We are inclined to believe that the Chinese Government will voluntarily and
                        perhaps by definite regulation or stipulation of law accord treatment along
                        the lines suggested in these two paragraphs. We therefore feel strongly that
                        it would be inadvisable to suggest that the Chinese Government be asked for
                        a note covering the points raised in these two paragraphs. We would perceive
                        no objection, should the British Government wish to do so, to the British
                        Government’s informally raising for the consideration and decision of the
                        Chinese Government the question whether the Chinese Government might not
                        wish to take whatever steps it might consider appropriate to provide for
                        treatment of foreigners in China along the lines set forth in the first two
                        paragraphs of the proposed Chinese note. We should be prepared, in case the
                        British Government considered that such a step on our part would be useful,
                        to offer similar informal comment to the Chinese. In so doing we would wish
                        to emphasize that the whole matter is one for the Chinese Government’s
                        consideration and sole determination.</p>
                    <p>(2) With regard to paragraph numbered 3 in the suggested note from the
                        Chinese Government, it is not in accordance with the treaty practice of the
                        United States to include such a provision in its treaties and an attempt to
                        do so might raise difficult questions of authority and policy in the field
                        of Federal and State relations in the United States. In as much as we wish
                        to keep this treaty as far as feasible on broad general lines, to include
                        only matters not likely to create difficulties in either the United States
                        or China, and to leave detailed arrangements <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321"
                            facs="0331"/>for the subsequent comprehensive treaty which is envisaged,
                        we for our part would not wish to raise this matter for inclusion in this
                        treaty or accompanying documents. It might be feasible to raise the question
                        informally with the Chinese Government along the lines suggested with regard
                        to paragraphs numbered 1 and 2 of the proposed Chinese note, but this
                        Government would wish to reserve decision as to whether it would desire to
                        specify all the points mentioned in paragraph numbered 3. Should the British
                        Government, however, wish to endeavor to exchange notes with the Chinese
                        Government along the lines set forth in paragraph numbered 3, this
                        Government would perceive no objection, except that such procedure would
                        detract from the advantage which may be expected to accrue from having the
                        two treaties as nearly as possible identical.</p>
                    <p>We realize that the British Government will include in its treaty appropriate
                        definitions of the British territories and nationals to which the treaty
                        will apply and provision for the rendition of the British Concessions at
                        Tientsin and Canton; also, that the amendments and suggestions offered by
                        the British Government are provisional in the sense that the British
                        Government has not as yet received the comments of the Governments of the
                        Dominions and of India.</p>
                    <p>In as much as we wish to present a draft treaty to the Chinese Government for
                        its consideration at the earliest feasible moment and as we wish to
                        synchronize our approach as nearly as we can with the British approach, the
                        Department suggests a procedure as follows: We would hand the Chinese
                        Ambassador here our draft treaty perhaps next Wednesday or Thursday and, if
                        the British draft should not be completed by that time due to non-receipt of
                        comments from some of the Dominions or India, we suggest that the British
                        Foreign Office might inform the Chinese Chargé in London on the same day as
                        our action is taken that the British Government is in general accord with
                        the proposals which appear in the draft which the United States Government
                        is presenting to the Chinese Ambassador in Washington but finds it necessary
                        to give consideration to certain points not covered in that draft, including
                        suggestions which may be offered by the Governments of the Dominions or of
                        India.</p>
                    <p>The Department would appreciate receiving as early as possible (1) the
                        British Government’s views on this suggested procedure, (2) the
                        clarification requested in regard to the sentence which the British propose
                        be added to Article III, and (3) such further comment as the British
                        Government may wish to offer.</p>

                    <p>5823. [My] 5752, October 15, 1 a.m. With reference to amended version which
                        Foreign Office suggested for the second paragraph of article VII of the
                        draft treaty with China on extraterritoriality, Foreign Office writes today
                        that it seems to be in line with the thought of the authors of the American
                        draft, and to make the Foreign Office intention clearer, if it inserts the
                        words “abrogated by or” between “insofar as they are not” and “inconsistent”
                        in the first sentence of the British suggested amended version. It mentions
                        that the same addition would also be required in the succeeding
                        sentence.</p>

                        Saturday it would be a great help to him in dealing with the Dominions and
                        India. If this is impossible, he will accept the procedure as laid down in

                    <p>I wanted you to know how hard he has tried to synchronize the timing and also
                        to keep the British text in line with our own.</p>
                    <p>It has been a great pleasure for me personally to have a small part in these
                        negotiations. The promptness of the Department’s replies and the drafting of

                    <p>5876. My 5875, October 21, 1 p.m. I have received from Mr. Eden the following

                    <p>Begin memorandum.</p>
                    <p>“(A) Article III. The additional sentence proposed by His Majesty’s
                        Government to article III only covers existing assets already vested in
                        trustees as security for obligations and liabilities. Trustees have at
                        present the right in case of default upon obligations to take over the
                        assets (for instance, the municipal waterworks at Tientsin; in Shanghai
                        similar arrangements have been made) and apply the revenues to payments due
                        upon the obligations. His Majesty’s Government’s desire is that these rights
                        of the trustees should be left unchanged. In the light of this explanation
                        we hope the United States Government will find it possible to adopt this
                        sentence.</p>
                    <p>(B) Article IV. In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government the effect of the
                        first paragraph of article IV of the American draft is to render all
                        existing rights and titles to real property indefeasible except upon proof
                        of fraud. Consequently a title acquired as the result of Japanese
                        confiscation would be made indefeasible and it was for this reason that the
                        addition was proposed by His Majesty’s Government. In any case there seems
                        no reason to suppose that the Chinese Government would object to this
                        addition and His Majesty’s Government would propose to retain it but hope
                        that on reconsideration the United States Government may also see its
                        utility.</p>
                    <p>(C) Article V. In deference to the views expressed by the United States
                        Government, the sentence ‘the right to carry on commerce shall only be
                        restricted in time of war and national emergency and then shall only be
                        restricted to such restrictions as are necessary in the interests of
                        national security and which are imposed upon all foreigners’ is being
                        deleted. On the other hand, His Majesty’s Government still attach great
                        importance to retaining the sentence beginning ‘in all legal proceedings’ et
                        cetera. They note that the United States Government are continuing their
                        study of this suggestion and suggest that on this point it would be
                        sufficient if both the American and British draft treaties contained some
                        sentence along these lines <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0335"/>and that
                        it would not be necessary that the sentences in the two drafts should be
                        identical. On this point it is possible that a sentence which suits the
                        position in the United Kingdom might not exactly suit the position in the
                        United States, and vice versa.</p>
                    <p>(D) Article VII. His Majesty’s Government note with pleasure that the United
                        States Government have accepted the addition of the word ‘navigation’ and
                        also the phrase ‘abrogated by or inconsistent with’ and the substitution of
                        the words ‘in future’ for the previous phrase. For their part His Majesty’s
                        Government will now be prepared to adopt the American draft of this article
                        with these three changes.</p>
                    <p>(E) Article I. In view of the United States Government’s observations, the
                        proposed amendment is dropped.</p>
                    <p>(G) Article VI. In view of the American acceptance of the two suggestions
                        which His Majesty’s Government have made, there is no difference of
                        substance between us with regard to this article. The text of the article as
                        it is proposed to put it in the British treaty reads as follows: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">

                                of the other high contracting party to interview, communicate with
                                and to advise the nationals and companies of the former high

                                authorities when any of their nationals are arrested or detained in
                                their consular districts by the local authorities. They shall have
                                the right to visit within the limits of their districts any of their
                                nationals who are under arrest or awaiting trial in prison.

                    </p>
                    <p>In this connection it ought perhaps to be explained that according to the
                        practice in the United Kingdom it is not possible to give China the right by
                        treaty (which would have to be extended also to other countries later) for
                        her consuls to visit Chinese nationals who have <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326"
                            facs="0336"/>been convicted and are serving their sentences of
                        imprisonment. It is only possible to give this right of visit to prisoners
                        who are under arrest or awaiting trial in prison.</p>
                    <p>(H) His Majesty’s Government have noted the views of the United States
                        Government as regards the proposed note. They will therefore take up these
                        points with the Chinese Government informally in the first place and they
                        accept with pleasure the American offer also to raise these points
                        informally with the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>The amendments to the United States draft transmitted in Mr. Winant’s two
                        letters of the 20 October are acceptable to His Majesty’s Government and
                        will be adopted by them.” End memorandum.</p>

                        <item>With regard to (A), Article III, we are glad to have the clarifying
                            statement of the British Government relating to the additional sentence
                            proposed by the British Government. Upon further consideration, it seems
                            to us that it would not be wise to add this sentence. We believe that
                            there is some likelihood that the Chinese Government will raise
                            objection to the second paragraph of the article as it stands without
                            the additional sentence and that the inclusion of such an addition would
                            substantially increase that likelihood. Moreover, we feel that the
                            assumption of obligation by the Chinese Government itself is sufficient
                            safeguard. For these reasons, as well as for the reason previously given
                            that it seems advisable to us to avoid too great particularization and
                            to keep the treaty to broad general terms, we regret that we do not feel
                            that we can adopt the proposed additional sentence.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>With regard to (B), Article IV, it is still not clear to us exactly
                            what the British Government has in mind by its proposed addition. This
                            Government has no intention of supporting an American national in any
                            claim regarding real property deriving from any illegal process and
                            therefore regards the British proposed addition, in so far as we
                            understand it, as not necessary. In so far as this proposal envisages
                            protection of valid British claims against confiscation under the aegis
                            of Japanese occupation, we think that the article as drafted without the
                            addition takes care of such a matter. We doubt whether the <pb n="327"
                                xml:id="pg_327" facs="0337"/>Chinese Government would understand the
                            exact meaning of the proposed addition and we therefore anticipate that
                            its inclusion would be likely to result in extended discussion and
                            consequent delay. We therefore are not adopting this suggestion,
                            although we do not perceive any strong objection to the British
                            Government’s including the addition in its draft if it, after
                            consideration of our comment, regards such addition as desirable.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>With regard to (C), Article V, we are glad to note that the British
                            Government is deleting the last sentence of the addition previously
                            proposed by the British Government. As previously stated, we have
                            continued our study of the British Government’s suggestion. This study
                            confirms us in the opinion that from our point of view the subject
                            matter of the first sentence suggested by the British might more
                            appropriately be taken care of in the comprehensive treaty which we
                            envisage negotiating with China at some subsequent time and might also
                            in the form proposed raise for us difficult questions relating to
                            Federal and State jurisdictions. We therefore are not including in our
                            draft this proposed British addition.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>With regard to (D), Article VII, and (E), Article I, there appears to
                            be agreement.</item>

                        <item>With regard to (G), Article VI, we note that there is little
                            difference of substance between the American draft and the British
                            draft. In as much as the American draft conforms more nearly to points
                            already embodied in existing American treaties, we are retaining our
                            draft. We assume that the British Government will use its draft. We
                            would point out for the consideration of the British Government that the
                            British draft does not accord a right of visit to nationals under
                            detention.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>With regard to (H), relating to the proposed note from the Chinese
                            Government, we do not understand the British Government’s statement that
                            they will take up the substance of that note with the Chinese Government
                            informally “in the first-place”. While this Government is prepared to
                            suggest to the Chinese Government informally that the Chinese Government
                            may care, of its own initiative and as a unilateral act on its part and
                            in whatever way the Chinese Government wishes, to take whatever steps it
                            might consider appropriate to provide for treatment of foreigners in
                            China along the lines set forth in the first two paragraphs of the
                            proposed note, and perhaps to provide for some of the matters contained
                            in the third paragraph, we continue to feel strongly that it would be
                            inadvisable to suggest, either formally or informally, to the Chinese
                            Government that it give a note covering the points mentioned. Before we
                            can decide to mention the matter informally to the Chinese Government,
                            we should like <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0338"/>to be sure that
                            we understand the British Government’s position in this respect.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>We note that the amendments to this Government’s draft communicated in
                            the Department’s 5146, October 19, 5 p.m., and 5147, October 19, 6 p.m.,
                            are acceptable to and will be adopted by the British Government.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>We understand that the Government of the United States and the British
                            Government are now in substantial agreement and know what each
                            Government intends to embody in the draft treaty which each will present
                            to the Chinese Government for that Government’s consideration. We
                            realize, as stated by the British Government, that phraseology which
                            suits the position in the United States might not exactly suit the
                            position in the United Kingdom, and vice versa. On this point we would
                            observe, however, that there are obvious and definite advantages to the
                            British treaty and the American treaty being as nearly identical as
                            circumstances permit. We also venture to repeat our view that it is
                            desirable that these treaties be drafted along broad general lines and
                            that they avoid particularization which can appropriately be left to the
                            negotiation later of comprehensive treaties and which, if included in
                            the present drafts of proposed treaties, might cause the Chinese to
                            present detailed desiderata of their own and thus delay the conclusion
                            of the treaties and dissipate the wholesome and beneficial psychological
                            atmosphere which has thus far resulted and which we earnestly hope may
                            be continued. We should greatly appreciate it if the British Government
                            would give further thought to these basic considerations with special
                            reference to the additions it has proposed to Article V and to Article
                            III.</item>

                        <item>In response to Mr. Eden’s suggestion we shall postpone the
                            presentation of the text of the draft treaty to the Chinese Ambassador
                            until Saturday morning, October 24. In so doing we shall ask the Chinese
                            Ambassador to regard the text as confidential until agreement thereon
                            has been reached between this Government and the Chinese Government. We

                            Government. We suggest that the British Government may care to follow a

                            printed.</note> and 5200, October 21, 10 p.m. I have just received from
                        Mr. Eden a letter dated October 23 [with] enclosure entitled “Memorandum
                        giving the views of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom on the
                        observations of the United States Government dated 22 October regarding the
                        draft treaty with China on extraterritoriality”. Mr. Eden’s letter reads in
                        part as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“I am grateful for the postponement by 2 days of the communication
                                which the United States Government proposes to make to the Chinese
                                Ambassador in Washington. Although we shall not ourselves be able to
                                communicate our draft treaty so early as tomorrow, the postponement
                                will help toward bringing our respective dates of communication
                                nearer together.</p>
                            <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0340"/>
                            <p>“I enclose herein a further memorandum in reply to the message from
                                the Department of State contained in your letter. As you will see,
                                it is our intention to bring our own draft treaty and procedure very
                                closely into conformity with yours. I would, however, draw your
                                attention once again to the important point of principle which
                                arises on article V of your draft treaty (see point C in the
                                accompanying memorandum).</p>
                            <p>“I am aware that the Chinese Government might see difficulty in
                                granting full national treatment especially in the matter of
                                industrial enterprise, but as I told you on the telephone last
                                night, we feel strongly that if we do not try to obtain national
                                treatment in the matters mentioned in article V from the Chinese
                                Government now it is highly improbable that we shall be able to
                                persuade them to grant it at a later stage when we come to negotiate
                                our comprehensive and detailed treaties. We should have been glad
                                therefore if the United States Government had seen its way to join
                                us in endeavoring to obtain for our commerce ordinary treatment in
                                accordance with international practice such as we are quite prepared
                                to grant to the Chinese ourselves and which carries with it no
                                stigma or vestige of the former inequality.”</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Eden further states that he would be grateful if the Department even at
                        this late hour would either reconsider the suggestions the British have made
                        or make some suggestion of its own which would cover in the present treaties
                        the point the British have in mind. He mentions that his reason for being so
                        insistent in this matter is that, as we know, the British have a larger
                        commercial interest at stake in China than most other countries. He points
                        out in conclusion that the last paragraph of the appended memorandum
                        provides an answer to the inquiry contained in Department’s 5208, October
                        22, 1 p.m.<note n="58" xml:id="d256fn58">Not printed; it made inquiry as to
                            whether the British Government intended to furnish China with the draft
                            text on October 24 or merely to inform the Chinese Chargé in London of
                            British substantial accord with the American draft
                            (793.003/959a).</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>(Begin memorandum) “A. Article III. In deference to the views of the United
                        States Government, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will
                        delete from their draft the additional sentence.</p>
                    <p>B. Article IV. H M G note that while the United States Government do not
                        propose to adopt the addition suggested by H M G, they have perceived no
                        objection to H M G’s including the addition in their own draft. H M G do
                        propose to retain this addition for this reason. Paragraph 1 of article IV
                        of the American draft treaty renders all existing titles to real property
                        indefeasible except upon proof of fraud. The expression ‘existing titles’
                        must mean all titles existing at the date the treaty comes into force. It
                        will therefore cover all titles issued by the Chinese land offices up to
                        that date, including therefore titles issued by the puppet offices which
                        have been functioning in the occupied territory since 1937. Some of the
                        titles <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0341"/>issued by the puppet offices
                        should be recognized but some of them, especially those issued in more
                        recent times, may have been acquired as the result of Japanese confiscation.
                        But as we read the American draft, all these titles will be rendered
                        indefeasible except upon proof of fraud.</p>
                    <p>C. Article V. H M G in the United Kingdom note that the United States
                        Government do not intend to include in their draft treaty any sentence
                        corresponding to the British suggested sentence beginning ‘in all legal
                        proceedings et cetera’. And that they consider this matter might be more
                        appropriately taken care of in the future comprehensive treaty referred to
                        in article VII. Unless the United States Government change their view, H M G
                        will also delete it from theirs. They wish, however, to express their
                        opinion that unless national treatment in matters of carrying on business et
                        cetera is secured in the present treaty it is highly improbable that it will
                        be possible to secure it in the future comprehensive treaty and that a mere
                        right to carry on business, unless national treatment as regards the
                        conditions of its carrying on is secured, may be of little practical
                        value.</p>
                    <p>G. Article VI. It would appear that one sentence from the British draft of
                        article VI must have been omitted in the text telegraphed to Washington. The
                        text of this article transmitted in the memorandum of the 20th October
                        contained the sentence ‘they (i. e. consular officers) shall have the right
                        to visit within the limits of their districts any of their nationals who are
                        under arrest or awaiting trial in prison’.</p>
                    <p>H. H M G’s statement that they would take up the substance of the proposed
                        draft note with the Chinese Government informally in the first place meant
                        that they would sound the Chinese informally and ascertain the Chinese
                        reaction. If the Chinese reaction was more favourable to the Chinese giving
                        a statement on their own initiative and as a unilateral act, H M G would
                        willingly accept it. If on the other hand the Chinese seemed to prefer
                        something on the basis of reciprocity then it would appear that the course
                        of reciprocal assurances by exchange of notes would be the best. If finally
                        the Chinese reaction was an absolute refusal to enter into any commitment in
                        this realm at all then H M G would be obliged to accept this refusal.</p>
                    <p>It will not be possible to obtain the agreement of all the Empire Governments
                        to the final text of the British draft treaty by the morning of 24th
                        October. H M G therefore propose to inform the Chinese Chargé d’Affaires in
                        London and the Chinese Government that they are awaiting the views of the
                        Dominions and India but that they expect their draft treaty to follow
                        closely the text of the American draft with the addition of a clause
                        covering the rendition of the British concessions at Tientsin and Canton.”

                    <p>The Chinese Ambassador called this morning at the Secretary’s request. The
                        Ambassador was accompanied by the Minister-Counselor of the Chinese Embassy,
                        Mr. Liu Chieh.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary first expressed his regret at having been detained at his
                        apartment by an unexpected matter. The Secretary then said that we had been
                        working on the matter of a draft of an extraterritoriality treaty which we
                        might give the Chinese Government for its consideration and that in
                        preparing a draft we had proceeded along broad general lines in the thought
                        that such a procedure would be the most satisfactory to both our
                        Governments. The Secretary continued that we had completed a draft, which he
                        thereupon handed to the Ambassador.<note n="59" xml:id="d257fn59">

                        </note> The Secretary added that the step which we were taking was one
                        which, as the Ambassador knew, we had long wished to take and that it
                        represented a practical manifestation of this country’s foreign policy. The
                        Secretary said that he was of course personally gratified at the step.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we had in mind informing the press in response to
                        inquiries that the Secretary had handed the Ambassador a draft treaty for
                        the consideration of the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary informed the Ambassador that we were of course not making
                        public the text of the draft treaty and that we assumed that the two
                        Governments would regard the text as strictly confidential pending
                        conclusion of discussions. The Ambassador indicated his concurrence.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary inquired whether there were any points which the Ambassador
                        wished to raise. The Ambassador said that he would forward the text to his
                        Government and that they would first like to read and examine the text. The
                        Secretary said that that of course was natural and that we would be here
                        available for discussion in case any question should occur to the Chinese
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador commented smilingly that it was hoped that this whole matter
                        could be disposed of rapidly.</p>
                    <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0343"/>
                    <p>The interview was friendly and cordial, and after a few moments the
                        Ambassador and Mr. Liu departed.</p>

                        the conclusion of a comprehensive modern treaty of friendship, commerce,
                        navigation and consular rights, upon the request of either Government or in
                        any case within six months after the cessation of the hostilities in the war
                        against the common enemies in which they are now engaged. The treaty to be
                        thus negotiated will be based upon the principles of international law and
                        practice as reflected in modern international procedures and in the modern
                        treaties which the Government of the United States of America and the
                        Government of the Republic of China respectively have in recent years
                        concluded with other governments.</p>
                    <p>Pending the conclusion of a comprehensive treaty of the character referred to
                        in the preceding paragraph, if any questions affecting the rights in
                        territory of the Republic of China of nationals (including corporations or
                        associations), or of the Government, of the United States of America should
                        arise in future and if these questions are not covered by the present
                        treaty, or by the provisions of existing treaties, conventions, or
                        agreements between the Government of the United States of America and the
                        Government of the Republic of China not abrogated by or inconsistent with
                        this treaty, such questions shall be discussed by representatives of the two
                        Governments and shall be decided in accordance with generally accepted
                        principles of international law and with modern international practice.</p>

                    <p>5271. Your 5923, October 23, 4 p.m. In the light of Mr. Eden’s views we have
                        added to Article V a sentence as follows: “Each of the two Governments will
                        endeavor to have accorded in territory under its jurisdiction to nationals
                        of the other country, in regard to all legal proceedings and to matters
                        relating to the administration of justice and to the levying of taxes or
                        requirements in connection therewith and to the carrying on of commerce,
                        treatment not less favorable than that accorded to its own nationals.”</p>
                    <p>The draft text as amended was handed by me to the Chinese Ambassador, in
                        accordance with prior arrangement, this morning at 10:30.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Liu called on Mr. Hamilton this afternoon by appointment. He stated that
                        the Chinese Ambassador, who was leaving town for a few days, had asked him
                        to call with a view to obtaining clarification of one or two points in
                        regard to the draft treaty which the Secretary had handed to the Ambassador
                        on October 24 in order that the Chinese Embassy would be in position to
                        reply to any inquiries which might be received from the Chinese Government
                        in the matter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hamilton made inquiry as to how the Chinese felt in general in regard to
                        the draft treaty and Mr. Liu replied that the draft was very gratifying. He
                        said that his first inquiry was in regard to the question of taxation; he
                        asked whether American citizens would continue to be considered as exempt
                        from Chinese taxes. Mr. Hamilton explained that by Article I American
                        nationals in Chinese territory would be subject to the jurisdiction of the
                        Chinese Government which meant jurisdiction of Chinese law including laws
                        relating to taxation. He added that this Government expected, of course,
                        that such laws <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0348"/>would be applied to
                        Americans in an equitable manner and would constitute only the duly
                        promulgated laws of the Chinese Government. Mr. Hamilton also mentioned that
                        for some time past this Government has advised American nationals in China
                        to pay regular and appropriate municipal taxes such as were properly
                        administered and used for public improvements, et cetera.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Liu made several inquiries in regard to matters which appeared to fall
                        under the Boxer Protocol: the question of Chinese fortifications at Taku and
                        Woosung; the stationing of foreign troops in China; the international bodies
                        known as the Whangpoo Conservancy and the Hai Ho Conservancy; and the Boxer
                        Indemnity. He was informed in reply that Article II made clear provision
                        that any and all rights accorded to this Government under the Boxer Protocol
                        and under agreements supplementary thereto shall cease and that these
                        particular questions were, of course, included in that provision.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Liu asked whether the questions of the navigation of inland waterways and
                        coastal trade were covered by the treaty, or were matters which we desired
                        reserved for future negotiation. He was informed in reply that our concept
                        of the brief draft treaty was that it should get at the heart of the
                        matter—consular jurisdiction and such related questions as required
                        immediate attention—and that details and particularization could most
                        appropriately be dealt with in the later subsequent modern treaty of
                        commerce, navigation, establishment and consular rights, but there had been
                        no thought in the Department that any particular subject or subjects as such
                        would be reserved for future negotiation. Mr. Hamilton went on to say that
                        the questions were not expressly mentioned in the draft treaty; that we had
                        not gone into them and he could not make a direct answer; that as regards
                        China the question would seem to have three parts—the question of the
                        navigation of rivers, the question of the entry of foreign vessels at ports
                        open to international trade which would now probably exclude some of the
                        “treaty ports” upriver such as Hankow and Kiukiang, and the question of the
                        use of inland waters by the public vessels of foreign nations; and that if
                        the Chinese Government had any suggestions to make in regard to this
                        particular matter we should be very glad to receive them. Mr. Atcheson added
                        that in regard to any such matters no one here had any thought of seeking to
                        keep or reserve or obtain from China anything which was not normal in modern
                        international relations and the whole concept had been that the brief treaty
                        on broad general lines would lay a basis in doctrine and principle for the
                        negotiation of the contemplated subsequent comprehensive treaty. Mr.
                        Hamilton went on to say that it had also been our concept, and he hoped that
                        it was likewise the Chinese concept, that any questions relating to the
                        treaty or questions arising later should be viewed by <pb n="339"
                            xml:id="pg_339" facs="0349"/>each Government in a broad light with
                        confidence in the good faith and fairness and friendship of the other
                        Government. Mr. Liu agreed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Liu then made a rather vague inquiry in regard to the landholdings of
                        missionaries in interior places in China. It was explained to him that the
                        provisions in regard to land appearing in Article II were included because
                        Chinese law, other than the existing treaties, did not cover the question of
                        leases in perpetuity and it was accordingly necessary to provide for
                        replacement of such leases by deeds of ownership; and that it was only just
                        and fair that landholdings should receive recognition and protection. Mr.
                        Liu agreed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Liu then asked a number of questions in regard to the International
                        Settlement at Shanghai. A particular question was the meaning of the
                        reference in Article III to the transfer of official obligations and
                        liabilities to the Chinese Government. It was explained to him that the
                        thought in mind here was that the International Settlement, was, for
                        example, something like a going business concern with assets and liabilities
                        and it seemed only appropriate that if the Chinese Government should take
                        over the administration and control, including the assets, the Chinese
                        Government should also include the obligations and liabilities. Mr. Liu
                        agreed and inquired what particular liabilities we had in mind. He was
                        informed that we had not gone into details in the matter but it was assumed
                        that there were some municipal obligations, including those arising out of
                        municipal debentures. Mr. Liu stated that as a student of law he understood
                        the situation and that, of course, any organization taking over another
                        organization assumed the liabilities as well as the assets.</p>
                    <p>Further conversation ensued in regard to the general purport and concept of
                        the draft treaty, during the course of which Mr. Hamilton mentioned that we
                        hoped to move forward in the matter as rapidly as practicable. Mr. Liu
                        replied that this was the Chinese hope also and he made a number of remarks
                        indicating that the draft in general had been well received at the Chinese
                        Embassy and that he understood and concurred in the views of this Government
                        in regard to its purport and purpose.</p>

                    <p>2. Please inform the British Foreign Office in regard to the above. With
                        particular regard to questions of coastal trade and of inland navigation by
                        both public and private vessels, it has been our intention in <pb n="340"
                            xml:id="pg_340" facs="0350"/>general to eliminate anomalies in the
                        treaty relations between the United States and China. At the same time we
                        realize that these particular questions may involve settlement of details
                        such as ownership of and compensation for wharves and other shipping
                        facilities which might be affected by relinquishment of rights of inland
                        navigation and that discussion of such details might result in undesired
                        delay in conclusion of the brief treaty which we have proposed to the
                        Chinese Government. Our general attitude toward this matter is therefore a
                        flexible one with inclination toward including in the treaty some
                        appropriate provisions on the subject, especially if the Chinese so desire.
                        An early expression of the British Government’s thought on this matter would
                        be welcomed.</p>

                    <p>5996. Department’s 5271, October 24, 11 a.m. I have received from Mr. Eden
                        the following communication dated October 26: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Thank you very much for letting me see the message from the
                                Department of State dated the 24th October indicating that the
                                Department had added a sentence to article V of the United States
                                draft treaty with China on extraterritoriality.</p>
                            <p>“I am greatly obliged to you for this information and would ask you
                                to convey to your Government our appreciation of their decision to
                                include in their draft treaty a clause on the lines indicated in the
                                message from the Department of State. The terms used are entirely
                                satisfactory to us and we shall include a corresponding clause in
                                our own draft treaty.</p>
                            <p>[“]I note that the United States draft treaty was handed to the
                                Chinese Ambassador at 10:30 a.m. on the 24th October. A
                                communication was made on that date both to the Chinese Chargé
                                d’Affaires in London and to the Chinese Government in Chungking to
                                the effect that His Majesty’s Government were still in consultation
                                with the Governments of the Dominions and India but they expected
                                their draft treaty to be closely similar to the United States
                                Government’s draft with the addition of a clause covering the
                                rendition of the British concessions at Tientsin and Canton; His
                                Majesty’s Government hoped to be in a position to present their
                                draft treaty to the Chinese Government in the very near future.”</p>

                    <p>The British draft of the treaty in its present form has been forwarded to me.
                        Would you want me to cable it as it is or wait until the British have
                        finished their consultations with the Dominions and India which might result
                        in some modification of the text?</p>

                    <p>1009. The Embassy at London has been informed by the British Foreign Office
                        that the text of the British draft treaty on extraterritoriality has been
                        sent to the British Ambassador at Chungking with instructions to present it
                        at the earliest possible moment to the Chinese Government. We are asking the
                        Embassy at London to request that the Foreign Office instruct the British
                        Ambassador to furnish you a copy of the text. We are also asking the Chinese
                        Embassy here to telegraph a request to the Chinese Foreign Office that it
                        furnish you promptly a copy of the text of the draft treaty which this
                        Government has presented to the Chinese for the consideration of the Chinese
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>For your information, the Brazilian Government has informed this Government
                        that it desires to take action in regard to relinquishment of
                        extraterritorial rights similar to ours. The Norwegian Government states
                        that it has informed the Chinese Government that Norway intends to negotiate
                        a treaty on the subject along the same lines as any treaty that might be
                        negotiated between this country and China. The Netherland Government states
                        that it has instructed its Minister in Chungking to inform the Chinese
                        Government that it also desires to proceed with negotiations with the
                        Chinese presumably along the same lines as this Government, except that the
                        Netherlands have a special problem in reference to matters relating to the
                        status of Chinese in the Netherlands East Indies.</p>

                            <p>“With reference to the extraterritoriality question in China, our
                                Ambassador at Chungking has called attention to the fact that the
                                future rights of our nationals to acquire real property are not at
                                present covered by the draft treaties.</p>
                            <p>Article IV of the American draft (article V of ours) safeguards only
                                existing rights and titles. In so far as the rights granted by the
                                provisions of the old treaties for the acquisition of land on
                                perpetual lease in the treaty ports can be held to be not
                                inconsistent with the present Treaty, article VII (article VIII of
                                our draft) indirectly preserves this right. But neither of these
                                provisions gives our nationals the right to acquire fial [<hi

                            <p>This point is one of considerable importance to our respective
                                interests in China and it appears to us most desirable that it
                                should be covered on a reciprocal basis during the present
                                negotiations. It would probably be convenient to deal with it in an
                                annexed exchange of notes. It is not improbable that the Chinese
                                Government will themselves have observations to make upon article V
                                as it stands, and the discussion of these will give us the
                                opportunity to press for this point to be covered.</p>
                            <p>I should greatly appreciate receiving the views of the United States
                                Government on this question at their early convenience. I can, of
                                course, give you further details of the exact technical position in
                                the United Kingdom on this subject if desired.”</p>

                    <p>5605. Your 6204, November 5, 5 p.m. Please inform Mr. Eden informally that
                        before presenting our draft treaty on extraterritoriality to the Chinese we
                        gave careful consideration to the subject which he has raised and that our
                        general thought on this subject is as follows:</p>
                    <p>One of the fundamental concepts we have had in mind in regard to the proposed
                        treaty is that it should be confined in general to the question of
                        extraterritorial jurisdiction and immediately related questions. In addition
                        we have felt that the treaty should be along broad lines and in general
                        should be of a character which would meet with prompt support in China and
                        in the United States. We have included <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344"
                            facs="0354"/>in our draft treaty provisions which would give new rights
                        in China to American nationals only in those few instances in which such
                        provisions would not be likely to conflict with this approach.</p>
                    <p>To endeavor to cover the subject mentioned by Mr. Eden would, we believe,
                        cause delay in concluding the treaty and would raise in the United States
                        because of the provisions of some state laws difficult questions relating to
                        state and federal jurisdictions. In the modern treaties concluded by this
                        Government, questions relating to real property are covered by very detailed
                        and precise provisions. In most cases the question of ownership of real
                        property is not covered. When it is covered, the provisions are of a
                        specialized character. We are accordingly of the opinion that it would be
                        preferable to hold in abeyance questions relating to this whole matter for
                        possible inclusion in the comprehensive treaty which we contemplate
                        concluding at a later time with the Chinese and if decision is then made to
                        include the subject to determine at that time the form and character which
                        provisions on this subject might most advantageously take.</p>

                    <p>The Ambassador of China, accompanied by Minister Liu Chieh, called at his
                        request and handed me three documents. One entitled “Treaty with regard to
                        Relations Between China and the United States of America”,<note n="66"
                            xml:id="d267fn66">Not found in Department files.</note> related to the
                        present negotiations on the general question of extraterritoriality. The
                        second related to a clarification and some modification of the pending
                        proposal on the subject of extraterritoriality.<note n="67"

                        I thanked him and said that my associates and I would give these matters
                        prompt and careful attention.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then said that his Government would be interested in the
                        question of liberalizing the Chinese immigration situation. I said that this
                        brought to my mind the many important questions that would arise in solving
                        the peace problems and establishing a suitable post-war economic and
                        political peace structure in international affairs. In this connection,
                        there must exist a complete relationship of trust and confidence,
                        friendliness and mutual cooperation among the principal governments of the
                        United Nations, such as China, Russia, Great Britain and the United States,
                        to speak without <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0355"/>invidious
                        distinction. I stated that there are today numerous trouble-making persons
                        who travel from one world capital to another and speak recklessly and too
                        often wilfully along the lines calculated to create misunderstanding or
                        suspicion in regard to the motives of friendship and the spirit of teamwork
                        existing among these great governments today. I added that this Government
                        has suffered somewhat from such loose mischievous lines of talk by persons
                        who make their living in this manner and who seek at all times to get
                        themselves in the press, and that many of these busybodies are increasingly
                        endeavoring to excite coolness and misunderstanding between these four
                        governments and their official heads.</p>
                    <p>After referring to our friendly relations with Russia and our difficulties in
                        fending off troublemaking utterances, such as referred to above, I referred
                        to China and said it was inconceivable to me that the Generalissimo would
                        allow any person to prejudice him in any manner against any of the official
                        heads of the principal United Nations even though some other Chinese
                        officials might be thus influenced; that the high officials of China, I am
                        sure, would immediately disregard the attempts of professional agitators to
                        arouse coolness between our governments, especially in the light of the
                        record of friendship and assistance furnished to China by the United State
                        beginning as far back as 1931, including our far-reaching steps to aid China
                        against Japanese aggression. I said that in so doing we ran the extreme risk
                        of war many times before the conflict actually came. All the time we were
                        safeguarding Chinese interests in dealing with the Japanese, just as much as
                        our own interests, and refusing to concede any Chinese rights to Japan even
                        for the sake of prolonging peace.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador listened intently and said he understood everything I was
                        bringing out and that it was important to avoid the interference of
                        trouble-making persons whose activities I had correctly described.</p>

                    <p>3. In the first Paragraph of Article IV in the original draft (which now
                        becomes Article V), the phrase “of fraud in the acquisition of such rights
                        or titles” to be amended to read “of fraud or other illegal practices in the

                        deleted the words “and to the carrying on of commerce”, as in the opinion of
                        the Chinese Government this subject can be properly left for more detailed
                        provision in a treaty of commerce to be negotiated in the near future.</p>
                    <p>5. In Paragraph i of Article VI of the original draft (which now becomes

                        places and cities of the other country which are or may be open to consular

                    <p>6322. I have just received the following letter dated November 10 from Mr.
                        Eden.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>“I am writing to you on a further point connected with our draft treaty
                            with China abolishing extraterritorial rights. You may recollect that
                            article 6 of the British draft gives Chinese nationals the right to
                            ‘travel, reside and carry on commerce’ throughout the territories
                            covered by the treaty. It does not give the right of entry. There is a
                            similar provision in the American draft. The Chinese are very likely to
                            raise this point, and although we can, so far as the United Kingdom is
                            concerned, grant the right of entry (since there is at present no
                            immigration legislation discriminating against Chinese in this country)
                            there are likely to be serious difficulties in the Dominions and some of
                            the Colonies.</p>
                        <p>For this reason I should be most grateful for any indication you can give
                            me of the way in which your Government, if confronted with this issue by
                            the Chinese, would propose to reply.”</p>

                    <p>5656. Your 6322, November 10, 6 p.m. In handing me on November 10 the Chinese
                        Government’s suggestions in regard to our proposed <pb n="348"
                            xml:id="pg_348" facs="0358"/>draft treaty (which suggestions are being
                        communicated to you in a separate telegram), the Chinese Ambassador said
                        that his Government would be interested in the question of liberalizing the
                        Chinese immigration situation. I said that this brought to mind the
                        important questions which would arise in solving the peace problems and
                        establishing a suitable post-war economic and political structure in
                        international affairs; and that there must exist a complete relationship of
                        trust and confidence, friendliness and mutual cooperation among the
                        principal Governments of the United Nations, such as China, Great Britain,
                        Russia, and the United States, to speak without invidious distinction.</p>
                    <p>It will be noted from our separate telegram to you mentioned above that the
                        Chinese propose an additional article to be Article No. I and to read as
                        follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The relations between the Republic of China and the United States of
                                America shall be based on the principles of equality and
                                reciprocity.”</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>We do not know the precise purpose which the Chinese have in mind in
                        suggesting this article but it may have relation to the question raised in
                        your telegram under reference. When we discuss the matter with the Chinese,
                        we have in mind saying that the suggested article seems to us to be an
                        unnecessary addition because the treaty speaks for itself; that the facts of
                        our relationships as exemplified in the treaty are more important than
                        descriptive phrases; that our concept of the brief treaty has been, as the
                        Chinese know, that it would accomplish the relinquishment of
                        extraterritorial and special rights and would take care of such related
                        questions as require attention because of the relinquishment of
                        extraterritorial rights; that we have hoped to achieve our purpose in such a
                        way as to avoid bringing in extraneous matters which might cause difficulty
                        and perhaps unfortunate public discussion either in this country or in
                        China; and that the suggested additional article contains language which in
                        our opinion is likely to be misconstrued by persons in this country as
                        affecting broad questions which are necessarily not within the scope of our
                        present endeavors.</p>

                        observations on two messages from the Department of State dated the 27th
                        (see Department’s 5325, October 27, 5 p.m.) and 31st October (see

                        extraterritoriality in China.</p>
                    <p>I now enclose a statement of our views on the points raised which I should be
                        very grateful if you would convey to the Department of State.</p>
                    <p>In the difficult question of coastal and inland navigation we feel strongly
                        the desirability of postponing precise arrangements until we come to
                        negotiate comprehensive treaties on a reciprocal basis. If we seem to be
                        somewhat insistent on this point you will understand that it is in part
                        because our interest in these trades in China is, in normal times, very
                        great—greater perhaps than that of any other foreign power except Japan—and
                        that the subject is therefore for us one of the first importance.”</p>

                        the Chinese Embassy in Washington in regard to the points enumerated in the

                        His Majesty’s Government are enquiring whether the Chinese Government wish
                        to prolong the validity of the Wang–Lampson exchange of notes of September
                            1930,<note n="73" xml:id="d271fn73">League of Nations Treaty Series,

                        benefit to the two countries.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Office are also in general agreement with the points set out in
                        the third sub-paragraph of paragraph 1 of the Department of State’s message
                        of 27 October. Their views are as follows: Questions of inland navigation
                        and coastal trade are not expressly covered in the draft treaty presented to
                        the Chinese nor would article 2 (article 1, American draft) specifically
                        abrogate any treaty rights under which British ships have hitherto been
                        permitted to engage in inland navigation and coastal trade. Moreover, His
                        Majesty’s Government would be very reluctant to include in the present
                        treaty any restrictive provisions regarding shipping which may not be
                        strictly necessary. They would wish instead to discuss these questions at a
                        later stage <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0360"/>with a view to arriving
                        at some mutual arrangement in the course of negotiations for a comprehensive
                        treaty of commerce and navigation such as article 7 of the American draft
                        (article 8 of ours) foresees. Meanwhile they would be prepared to tell the
                        Chinese Government that while they have no wish to retain the unilateral
                        treaty rights they at present possess, they hope that pending the
                        negotiations for a comprehensive treaty the Chinese Government will not
                        prohibit British shipping from engaging in inland navigation and, when this
                        again becomes possible, the coastal trade of China, especially as both in
                        the United Kingdom and the Colonies Chinese shipping is in practice
                        permitted to engage in these trades.</p>
                    <p>It seems likely that if the matter were dealt with on these lines time would
                        be saved in negotiating the treaty as a whole. But in any case it is the
                        opinion of the Foreign Office that the line just proposed makes a better
                        tactical approach to the Chinese Government than the immediate offer of
                        treaty restrictions. If, nevertheless, the inclusion of an additional
                        article in the treaty became unavoidable His Majesty’s Government would be
                        willing to accept one on the general lines of that proposed in the message
                        from the State Department enclosed in Mr. Winant’s letter of 1st
                            November,<note n="74" xml:id="d271fn74">It was based on Department’s
                            telegram No. 5440, October 31, 3 p.m., <ref target="#pg_341">p.
                                341</ref>.</note> but they would wish in the British draft to bring
                        the wording into line with the comparable provisions in other commercial
                        treaties concluded by this country and to consult the Government of India
                        further in this matter.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Office would point out, however, that the words ‘ports, places
                        and waters of the other which are or may be open to foreign commerce’ in the
                        text proposed by the State Department would appear to be inconsistent with
                        article 5 of the American draft treaty which accords the right to carry on
                        trade throughout the Republic of China. It is suggested that the words
                        ‘foreign shipping’ or preferably ‘overseas merchant shipping’ would be more
                        suitable in this context than ‘foreign commerce.’ The phrase ‘overseas
                        merchant shipping’ is preferable because it would avoid any ground for
                        discrimination against foreign shipping as regards the ports open to
                        it.”</p>

                    <p>Mr. Liu telephoned me late November 11, referred to the informal memorandum
                        in regard to proposed Chinese modifications of the draft <pb n="351"
                            xml:id="pg_351" facs="0361"/>treaty which was handed to the Secretary by
                        the Chinese Ambassador on November 10, and stated that he would be at our
                        disposal at any time to discuss this matter. I stated that we were studying
                        the Chinese suggestions but had not got very far with them, that there
                        appeared to be one or two points on which we might like some clarification,
                        and that I would communicate with him again. After consultation with Mr.
                        Hornbeck I asked Mr. Liu to call this afternoon. He came at five
                        o’clock.</p>
                    <p>After some general discussion we went over the Chinese suggestions point by
                        point.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the suggested new article to be Article I of the treaty, I said
                        that this suggestion raised some definite questions. It seemed to us to be
                        an unnecessary addition because the treaty speaks for itself and the facts
                        of the relationships between this Government and the Chinese Government as
                        exemplified in the treaty are more important than descriptive phrases. As
                        the Chinese know, our concept of the brief treaty has been that it would
                        accomplish without delay the relinquishment of extraterritorial and special
                        rights and would take care of such immediately related questions as would
                        require attention because of the relinquishment of extraterritorial rights.
                        We had hoped to achieve our purpose in these respects in such a way as to
                        avoid bringing in extraneous matters which might cause difficulty either in
                        this country or in China and in our opinion the suggested additional article
                        contains language which would be subject to misconstruction by persons in
                        this country as affecting broad questions which are necessarily not within
                        the scope of our present endeavors.</p>
                    <p>In response to an inquiry by Mr. Liu whether the use in the suggested article
                        of the words “equality and reciprocity” was in itself considered harmful, I
                        went over the points mentioned above and added that it was not customary to
                        employ such phrases in the modern treaties which we had concluded with other
                        countries as it was to be assumed that the treaties constituted treaties
                        between equals and, having in mind the comprehensive treaty which we hope to
                        conclude with China later on, it was a matter of policy to adhere as closely
                        as possible to the language we had employed in such treaties. In other
                        words, our concept of this whole matter is that we are proceeding to wipe
                        out anomalies in our relations with China and to place those relations on a
                        basis of what is normal and usual in modern international practice. Mr. Liu
                        said that he supposed the Chinese Government put store by the suggested
                        language because of the inequalities of the past which had existed in the
                        relationships between China and various other countries and that it had for
                        some years been the policy of the Chinese Government to have inserted some
                        such language in <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0362"/>the new and modern
                        treaties which it had concluded with a number of countries. In this
                        connection he cited Article III of the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of 1928:
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The two High Contracting Parties have decided to enter as soon as
                                possible into negotiations for the purpose of concluding a Treaty of

                                    of absolute equality and non-discrimination</hi> in their
                                commercial relations and mutual respect for sovereignty.”
                                (Underscoring added.)</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>I restated in other terms the Department’s objections to the suggested
                        article and we proceeded to discuss the other Chinese suggestions. At the
                        end of his call Mr. Liu reverted to the suggested new article and mentioned
                        that the Chinese Ambassador in handing the memorandum of suggestions to the
                        Secretary on November 10 had made some mention of the question of
                        immigration. I referred to the Secretary’s remarks on that occasion and said
                        again what I had said before—that we had hoped in the brief treaty to take
                        care of extraterritoriality and immediately related matters and to avoid
                        going into extraneous questions or wandering afield in any way that might
                        cause delay.</p>
                    <p>As regards the other suggestions, I stated to Mr. Liu that we had not got far
                        in our study of them and the questions I would like to ask him were purely
                        personal and informal. He said that he was glad to have an opportunity to
                        talk informally and unofficially, as that was always helpful.</p>
                    <p>I went on to say that I did not quite understand the suggested amendment in
                        paragraph 2 of the Chinese memorandum, as the additional words which the
                        Chinese desired would seem to vitiate rights in the Quarter and Settlements
                        which stemmed from provisions of treaties and agreements and were in
                        accordance therewith but which had grown up outside the purview of Chinese
                        regulations and of Chinese laws other than the treaties. As an example, I
                        did not know whether the contract between the Shanghai Power Company and the
                        Municipal Council of the International Settlement had been drawn up in
                        accordance with Chinese legal procedure; I assumed that it had been drawn up
                        in accordance with American law and that it was a perfectly legal and
                        legitimate contract. I added that the word “legitimate” in our draft as
                        describing the rights in question was a good safeguard to the Chinese
                        Government and it seemed to me offhand that it was sufficient. Mr. Liu said
                        that, while he did not know, he supposed that the Chinese Government had in
                        mind some kinds of illegal contracts that might exist such as, for example,
                        a contract for a gambling concession in the French area of Shanghai and as
                        the new treaty with the United States would be a model for treaties with
                        other <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0363"/>extraterritorial countries
                        his Government was naturally being as careful as possible in regard to
                        questions of phraseology, et cetera. He did not think there would be any
                        disposition on the part of the Chinese authorities to deny legitimate rights
                        and he would make inquiry of his Government on this point.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the first item of paragraph three of the Chinese suggestions, a
                        similar discussion ensued. Mr. Liu stated that this was also a question of
                        legal phraseology, that “fraud” did not technically cover, for example,
                        misrepresentation.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the second item of paragraph three, Mr. Liu said that he hoped
                        we understood the purpose of the suggestion, which was, of course, to
                        preclude after the war widespread purchase of land by Japanese. I said that
                        I wondered if the same result could not be achieved by regulation, that even
                        under extraterritoriality land is governed by the <hi rend="italic">lex
                            loci</hi> and certainly after extraterritoriality should be abolished
                        there would be nothing in the way of the Chinese Government’s looking after
                        matters of that kind by means of regulation and procedure. It accordingly
                        seemed to me unnecessary to emphasize the matter, especially the political
                        aspects of it, in the treaty. I said that my concern was that considerable
                        American land holdings would be for sale and the Chinese suggestion would
                        appear to impose a restriction which if applied in an arbitrary manner by
                        local officials might mean that the American land holder would get next to
                        nothing for such land as he might wish to dispose of.</p>
                    <p>In regard to paragraph four of the Chinese suggestions, I indicated that this
                        point might be deferred for subsequent discussion.</p>
                    <p>In regard to paragraph five of the Chinese suggestions, I said that the
                        suggested addition did not seem to me to be necessary as treaty ports would
                        be abolished as such, our relations would be on a normal basis, and the
                        question of appointment of Consuls at particular places would of course be a
                        matter of agreement. I said that I did not know of any modern treaties which
                        this country has with other countries in which this language is used as it
                        is naturally assumed that such questions are resolved by mutual agreement.
                        Mr. Liu stated that obviously in this instance the Chinese Government had in
                        mind the Japanese and also the most-favored-nation clause which, as I knew,
                        had grown to be anathema to modern Chinese because under that clause in the
                        extraterritoriality treaties various countries large and small coming late
                        on the scene had been able to acquire for themselves special rights and
                        privileges and as a result the extraterritorial system had become more and
                        more tightly fastened upon China.</p>
                    <p>In regard to paragraph six of the Chinese suggestions, I said that it was our
                        hope to avoid particularization as much as possible in the treaty and that
                        some of the points mentioned in the suggested exchange <pb n="354"
                            xml:id="pg_354" facs="0364"/>of notes would seem to be already covered
                        by the general terms of the draft treaty. For example, the question of
                        special courts in the International Settlements would not seem to arise if
                        there were no International Settlements. As regards the mention of treaty
                        ports, I said that treaty ports as such were of course part of the
                        extraterritoriality system and the abolition of them was within our concept
                        of what the treaty should accomplish. I mentioned that their abolition would
                        leave the American public and the world at large in the dark as to which
                        Chinese ports were considered to be open to foreign commerce. The United
                        States Customs, for example, published a list of the ports of the United
                        States open to foreign commerce. As regards the question of pilots, I
                        assumed that what the Chinese Government had in mind was the compulsory
                        employment of foreign pilots under the old pilotage regulations and I
                        mentioned that of course under the port regulations of large ports it was
                        usually required of foreign vessels that pilots be employed. We understood
                        the Chinese desire to get rid of the provisions of the pilotage regulations
                        requiring the employment of a certain number of foreign pilots. As regards
                        the question of coastal trade, inland navigation, and the visits of foreign
                        naval vessels, I remarked that these questions were entirely unrelated to
                        the question of extraterritoriality—there was, for instance, the example of
                        the Amazon River, which is open to foreign commerce—but, as Mr. Hamilton had
                        indicated to him during his call on October 26, the Department would look
                        into them if the Chinese Government so desired. I went on to say, as Mr.
                        Hamilton and I had also said to him on October 26, that in regard to these
                        matters mentioned in the suggested exchange of notes we had no thought of
                        seeking to keep or reserve or obtain from China anything that was not normal
                        in modern international relations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Liu stated that he would seek clarification of various points from the
                        Chinese Foreign Office at Chungking and inquired when we might have a more
                        formal and definitive discussion of the Chinese suggestions. (In regard to
                        the suggested additional article he understood, of course, that I had given
                        him the opinion of the Department whereas the remainder of our discussion
                        was purely personal and informal.) He said that the Chinese Government was
                        very anxious to get forward with the treaty. I replied that we too wished to
                        expedite the matter and that I would make every effort to advance it. Mr.
                        Liu stated that he was leaving for New York tomorrow and would return to
                        Washington on Wednesday, November 18.</p>
                    <p>The conversation was most cordial and friendly in every way.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Tsui telephoned this afternoon and stated that the Chinese Embassy had
                        received a telegraphic instruction from the Chinese Foreign Office at
                        Chungking directing that an additional sentence be inserted in the text of
                        the proposed note from the Chinese Government to this Government, which was
                        attached to the document handed to the Secretary by the Chinese Ambassador
                        on November 10, embodying various Chinese suggestions for modification of
                        our draft treaty. Mr. Tsui asked if it would be necessary for him to deliver
                        the revised text of the proposed note in person or would it suffice if he
                        sent it by messenger. I told him that sending it by messenger would be quite
                        all right. Subsequently I received from him the revised text which is
                        attached hereto,<note n="76" xml:id="d273fn76">Not printed.</note> the
                        suggested addition being the penultimate substantive sentence reading: “The
                        questions which are not covered by the present treaty and exchange of notes
                        annexed thereto and which affect the sovereignty of the Republic of China,
                        shall be discussed by the representatives of the High Contracting Parties
                        and shall be decided in accordance with the generally accepted principles of
                        international law and modern international practices.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Tsui telephoned later to inquire in regard to the receipt of the revised
                        text, and I took the occasion to ask his opinion as to the purpose it was
                        intended to serve. He stated that he assumed it was intended to cover
                        questions such as the stipulation covered in exchange of notes between the
                        British Minister and the Tsung-li Yamen of February 3 and February 13,

                    <p>One. [Here follows summary of memorandum dated November 13, printed on <ref

                    <p>Two. For the information of the British Foreign Office, we perceive no
                        objection to covering in an exchange of notes, if the Chinese continue in
                        their desire therefor, such questions as foreign pilots, special courts and
                        treaty ports, especially, as regards the latter, if there is included in the
                        body of the treaty some appropriate provision relating to inland navigation
                        which would grant us reciprocal rights. For our part we might have one or
                        two additional matters to cover in such notes as, for example, the question
                        of the disposition of cases pending before the United States Court for
                        China. While we have not yet obtained sufficient factual information in
                        regard to the number, kind and importance of such cases, it is understood
                        that they are chiefly bank receiverships and estates in occupied China, and
                        that some of the estates are being handled informally by the Swiss
                        authorities in that area. In the light of the impossibility in the near
                        future of formally adjudicating such matters in occupied China, we are
                        inclined to the view that the simplest way of disposing of them would be to
                        include in the suggested exchange of notes a stipulation somewhat as
                        follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“It is mutually understood that the orders, decrees, judgments,
                                decisions and other acts of the United States Court for China and of
                                the Consular Courts of the United States in China shall be
                                considered as <hi rend="italic">res judicata</hi>. It is further
                                understood that any cases pending before the United States Court for
                                China and the Consular Courts of the United States in China at the
                                time of the coming into effect of this treaty shall be remitted to
                                the appropriate courts of the Government of the Republic of China
                                which shall proceed as expeditiously as possible with their
                                disposition and in so doing shall in so far as practicable apply the
                                laws of the United States.”</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>The British Government doubtless has a similar problem in regard to the
                        British courts in China.</p>
                    <p>Three. There would seem now to be three important questions for decision, as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>(1) The question of the additional article which the Chinese have suggested
                        be adopted as Article I. As we have indicated, the Department feels strongly
                        that we should not concur in the suggested inclusion of such article.</p>
                    <p>(2) The questions of inland navigation, et cetera. We have given careful
                        thought to the questions of the special rights which vessels of the United
                        States have been accorded with regard to coastal trade and inland navigation
                        and the special rights which naval vessels of the United States have been
                        accorded in the waters of China. These questions were raised by the Chinese
                        Foreign Minister orally before his recent departure for China; they were
                        raised again orally by the Chinese Minister Counselor on October 26; they
                        were raised in the <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0367"/>document which
                        the Chinese Ambassador handed to me on November 10 and they were raised for
                        the fourth time by the Minister Counselor on November 13.</p>
                    <p>As indicated in the Department’s 5325, October 27, 5 p.m., paragraph 2, our
                        inclination in general has been toward including in the treaty some
                        appropriate provisions on these subjects, especially if the Chinese should
                        so desire. It has become apparent that the Chinese definitely desire the
                        inclusion of such provisions in the treaty or in a supplemental exchange of
                        notes. Our impression is that the Chinese will be insistent in this respect
                        because, for one thing, the rights in China which we possess in regard to
                        coastal trade and inland navigation (including navigation of inland waters
                        by our naval vessels) are special and unilateral rights and, for another
                        thing, those rights, although not actually related to extraterritoriality,
                        are strongly associated in both the Chinese official and public mind with
                        extraterritoriality.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the course of our talks with Chinese officials we have repeated
                        and emphasized that we do not have any thought of seeking to reserve or
                        retain or to obtain from China anything that is not normal and usual in
                        international relations; that it has been our concept and assumption that
                        the brief treaty would once and for all eliminate the anomalies in the
                        relationships between the two countries; and that the primary objective of
                        the treaty is to accomplish the abolition of extraterritorial and other
                        special rights and to take care of such additional matters as require
                        attention because of the abolition of rights of a special character.</p>
                    <p>It would be most unfortunate if the signing of the treaty should be delayed
                        because of difficulty over questions relating to any special rights which it
                        has been our intention in general to take care of by means of the treaty. In
                        all probability the existence of difficulties in regard to important issues
                        would not remain long unknown to the public in China or in this country. Any
                        unwarranted delay in the signing of the treaty would of itself probably
                        furnish indication of the existence of controversy or other important
                        difficulty. We feel sure that public opinion here would be adversely
                        critical of any development which might have the appearance of an endeavor
                        to retain important special and unilateral rights which we for our part are
                        not in position to grant to the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>In the light of the above, we would suggest that the British Government might
                        wish to give further consideration to the question of adopting an article
                        along the general line of ours. In this connection we have of course taken
                        note of Mr. Eden’s statement in his letter of November 12 mentioned above
                        that, if the inclusion in the treaty of <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358"
                            facs="0368"/>such additional article should become unavoidable, the
                        British Government would be agreeable thereto although it would wish to
                        bring the wording in the British draft in line with comparable provisions in
                        other British treaties.</p>
                    <p>We accept the suggestion of the British Foreign Office that the words
                        “overseas merchant shipping” be substituted for the words “foreign commerce”
                        in paragraph 2 of our suggested article following reference to the ports,
                        places, and waters which are to be opened to overseas merchant shipping. (We
                        do not interpret the phrase “and carry on trade” in Article V of our draft
                        as granting or implying rights of inland navigation, et cetera.)</p>
                    <p>(3) The question of the clause in regard to commerce in Article V. It will be
                        recalled that we concurred in the suggested inclusion of this clause at the
                        earnest request of the British Government although we felt that it might
                        logically be regarded as one of the questions to be considered in the later
                        comprehensive treaty. As indicated in One (4) we for our part would not
                        object to deleting from Article V the words “and to the carrying on of
                        commerce” but would be pleased to receive the further views of the British
                        Government in the matter.</p>
                    <p>Four. Our draft treaty was presented to the Chinese Government on October 24.
                        We are, for obvious reasons, desirous of proceeding expeditiously toward
                        agreement with the Chinese on the final draft. It would be gratifying to us
                        if the treaty could be signed within the next three or four weeks.</p>

                        Chinese proposals made here to British Ambassador which so far as they
                        concern matters of mutual interest are substantially the same as those made
                        at Washington.</p>
                    <p>British Ambassador is of opinion that proposed new article I is intended
                        largely for purposes of “face” with Chinese people. I do not dismiss
                        possible relation of proposal to subject mentioned in your 1077. Australian
                        Minister recalls that Japanese made similar proposal at 1919 Peace
                            Conference.<note n="82" xml:id="d275fn82">See <ref

                    <p>I believe we should request explanation of exact purpose of proposed
                        insertion at end of second paragraphs of our articles II and III. To me the
                        proposal represents a technical saving clause which maybe availed of to
                        question “legitimate rights”. For example the franchises now held by
                        Shanghai Power and Telephone Companies, both American, might be attached
                            [<hi rend="italic">attacked?</hi>] as not consonant with laws and
                        regulations of China.</p>
                    <p>In same way I suggest request for explanation of purpose of phrase “or other
                        illegal practices” after word “fraud” in our article IV. Many customs and
                        practices regarding land transfers in China may not have been “legal” under
                        Chinese law but were settled local procedure and customs not “illegal” under
                        foreign law. Insertion of proposed phrase would open opportunity for
                        numerous disputes.</p>
                    <p>Proposed new paragraph to be inserted in same article IV, besides making
                        provision in derogation of the right of alienation, also carries provisions
                        regarding taxation, national defense and right of eminent domain which it
                        seems to me should be carefully examined and preferably deferred to the
                        later negotiation of comprehensive treaties. Military extortions, occupation
                        of mission property under pretext of national defense, and quartering of
                        troops in mission compounds have always given us much trouble and are
                        certain to become serious problem if not carefully adjusted in advance.</p>
                    <p>In article V the proposed deletion of the reference to commerce portends that
                        we shall not be granted reciprocity and equality in the treaty of commerce
                        later to be negotiated. I am not surprised.</p>
                    <p>The proposed change in article VI would seem to offer opportunity for
                        discrimination but I am not informed what modern treaties provide on this
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>Proposed exchange of notes, of course, seeks to have brief treaty include
                        relinquishment of all special rights. I doubt whether exchange of notes is
                        adequate for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>Question of coastwise shipping and inland navigation will particularly affect
                        British. China should realize that the proposal would leave her with little
                        or no tonnage to handle coastwise and inland trade after the war until new
                        tonnage is acquired.</p>
                    <p>Relinquishment of right of foreign pilots would affect us at Shanghai where
                        [there] are few Chinese pilots acquainted with the river and at the same
                        time capable of handling large oceangoing ships. American pilots have
                        substantial financial interest in the pilotage service ships and equipment
                        at Shanghai. China should compensate for their interest in taking over
                        pilotage.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>1. During his call at the Department on November 13, the Minister Counselor
                        of the Chinese Embassy discoursed at some length on the Chinese aversion to
                        the “most favored nation” clauses which in the old extraterritorial treaties
                        with China had worked, he said, to China’s great disadvantage almost from
                        the very beginning of extraterritoriality in that country. He indicated that
                        enlightened Chinese officials of course understood the use of the clause in
                        modern treaties concluded between nations on a basis of equality and
                        reciprocity but pointed out that the general conception of the clause in the
                        Chinese official and public mind is that it is an integral and much resented
                        part of the extraterritorial system. He referred to recent articles in the
                            <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi> of Chungking advocating that the
                        Chinese take a strong stand to insure that no such clause be included in the
                        contemplated, new treaties between China and the United States and between
                        China and other countries. He pointed out that the clause in question had
                        grown to be anathema to the Chinese Government and people because under it
                        in the extraterritorial treaties various countries, large and small, as they
                        came on the scene in China had been able to acquire for themselves special
                        rights and privileges and as a result the system of extraterritoriality had
                        become more and more tightly fastened upon China.</p>
                    <p>It is our opinion that the Minister Counselor correctly described and
                        explained Chinese feeling in this regard, and it has occurred to us that our
                        negotiations with the Chinese might be facilitated by substituting for any
                        specific reference in the treaty to “most favored nation treatment” other
                        language which will be no less effective and which might be more acceptable
                        to the Chinese and might thus obviate avoidable opposition and delay. The
                        only reference to “most favored nation treatment” in the texts now under
                        consideration occur in the second paragraph of our proposed additional
                        article on coasting trade, inland navigation, etc. We are of the opinion
                        that the language of that paragraph might be altered to read: “The
                        Government of the United States of America and the Government of the
                        Republic of China mutually agree that the merchant vessels of each country
                        shall be <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0371"/>permitted freely to come
                        to the ports, places, and waters of the other country which are or may be
                        opened to overseas merchant shipping, and that the treatment accorded such
                        vessels in such ports, places and waters shall be no less favorable than
                        that accorded to national vessels and shall be as favorable as that accorded
                        to the vessels of any third country. The coasting trade and inland
                        navigation of each country are excepted from the requirement of national
                        treatment and are to be regulated according to the laws of each country in
                        relation thereto. It is agreed, however, that vessels of either country
                        shall enjoy within the territory of the other country with respect to the
                        coasting trade and inland navigation treatment as favorable as that accorded
                        to the vessels of any third country.”</p>
                    <p>2. Chinese desires as exemplified in the Chinese suggestion for an additional
                        article to be adopted as Article I to the effect that the relations between
                        China and the United States shall be “based on the principles of equality
                        and reciprocity” might be met by altering the preamble of our draft treaty
                        to read: “The United States of America and the Republic of China, in
                        recognition of the friendly relations which have long prevailed between
                        their two peoples, of their common commitment to high purposes in the
                        regulation of human affairs and their common desire that the principle of
                        equality among sovereign States be made increasingly effective, have
                        resolved to conclude a treaty for the adjustment of certain matters in
                        regard to jurisdiction in China and related questions, and have appointed et
                        cetera.” We propose to make a suggestion along those lines to the
                        Chinese.</p>
                    <p>3. With reference to paragraph 2 of the Chinese suggestion, it occurs to us
                        that the deletion from the end of the second paragraph of Articles II and
                        III of our draft treaty of the words “and for the recognition and protection
                        of all legitimate rights therein” would eliminate any basis for the
                        additional clause suggested by the Chinese Government. We propose to suggest
                        to the Chinese that this question be resolved in this manner.</p>
                    <p>4. With a view to resolving the question raised by the Chinese in the first
                        part of paragraph 3 of their suggestions, we propose to suggest that the
                        particular language under discussion be altered to read: “it is agreed that
                        such existing rights and titles shall be indefeasible and shall not be
                        questioned upon any ground except upon proof, established through due
                        process of law, or fraud or of fraudulent or other dishonest practices in
                        the acquisition of such rights or titles, it being understood that no right
                        or title shall be rendered invalid by virtue of any subsequent change in the
                        official procedure through which it was acquired.”</p>
                    <p>Sent to London and Chungking.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Liu called by appointment at his request at noon today. Mr. Liu referred
                        to our conversation of November 13 and stated that the Chinese Embassy had
                        now received from the Chinese Foreign Office a reply to the telegram which
                        he had had sent to Chungking as a result of that conversation. With
                        reference to the Chinese suggestion that a new article to be numbered one be
                        inserted in the treaty to the effect that the relations between China and
                        the United States should be “based on the principles of equality and
                        reciprocity” and with reference to the Department’s views in the matter as I
                        had communicated them to him orally on November 13, he stated that the
                        Chinese Government continued to desire the insertion of such article as the
                        question devolved upon a principle which the Chinese Government regarded as
                        fundamental; moreover, the employment of such language in the treaty would
                        be of assistance to the Chinese Government because it would be very pleasing
                        to the Chinese people as a whole. In reply I went over the reasons why the
                        Department felt that the suggested article was unnecessary and would be out
                        of place in the treaty. In addition I mentioned again that the language
                        suggested might be subject to misconstruction in both China and the United
                        States and I said, as on my own, that we did not wish the treaty to pretend
                        to be something that it was not or to imply in any way that it covered
                        questions which were not covered; that there were a number of questions in
                        international relations which would come up for discussion sometime; that
                        all such questions would not be settled all at once, but must await their
                        turn and let progress be made step by step; that I perceived no possibility
                        of arranging for the inclusion in the brief treaty on extraterritoriality of
                        any language which purported, or might be considered to purport, to cover
                        matters not actually covered.</p>
                    <p>I went on to say that we had given the Chinese suggestion the most careful
                        and most sympathetic consideration and that, in an earnest endeavor to meet
                        Chinese wishes in any way that would be appropriate and practicable, we were
                        in the process of drafting something in other language which I thought would
                        probably resolve this particular question to the satisfaction of all
                        concerned. I said further that in formulating our draft of the brief treaty
                        we had attempted in the very best faith and in a whole-hearted spirit of
                        friendship for China to be very generous in regard to the relinquishment of
                        extraterritorial <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0373"/>and related
                        special rights. We had not, for example, attempted to use
                        extraterritoriality for bargaining purposes; we had not asked of the Chinese
                        any <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo;</hi> we had asked for nothing that was
                        not usual and normal in the modern relations between two friendly countries;
                        I hoped that the Chinese Government had noted and would appreciate these
                        facts.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Liu said that he understood the situation and that our attitude in the
                        matter, he was sure, was fully appreciated in Chungking; the Chinese Embassy
                        had done its best to explain to the Chinese Foreign Office the reasons for
                        our attitude and the reasons which assumably lay behind that attitude.</p>
                    <p>We then proceeded to discuss, also in a purely informal and personal way,
                        other of the modifications suggested by the Chinese and during this portion
                        of our talk I made tentative suggestions, without commitment, in regard to
                        the resolving of the various points along the lines already suggested to the
                        British Government. Mr. Liu indicated that he personally was agreeable to,
                        and pleased with, these suggestions and that he felt that they would in
                        general be well received by the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>At various times throughout our conversation Mr. Liu pressed me to give him
                        an approximate date on which the Chinese Embassy could expect to receive
                        formally our counter-suggestions in a document in reply to that presented to
                        the Secretary by the Chinese Ambassador on November 10 and asked twice
                        whether such document could not be ready within a week at most. He mentioned
                        that the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang was now in session at
                        Chungking and that it was very desirable, from the Chinese Government’s
                        point of view, that the draft treaty be at least agreed upon and possibly
                        signed before the meetings of the Central Executive Committee should
                        terminate. He said that the Chinese Foreign Office felt that if the treaty
                        could be agreed upon before the termination of the Committee’s sessions the
                        political benefits in China as well as in Sino-American relations would be
                        increased. I told Mr. Liu that we were working earnestly in the matter and
                        were ourselves very anxious to get forward with it. I mentioned that we had
                        hoped that the draft treaty would not take long to negotiate and one of the
                        considerations in our minds in connection with the presentation of the draft
                        treaty was that it could, if too many details were not interjected into the
                        matter, be handled expeditiously, leaving particularization to be covered in
                        the later comprehensive treaty.</p>
                    <p>Upon leaving Mr. Liu gave repeated expressions of appreciation of our
                        efforts. The conversation was extremely friendly and cordial throughout.</p>

                    <p>1385. For the Secretary and Under Secretary. During a visit to Foreign
                        Minister this morning he mentioned the matter of the extraterritoriality
                        treaty and said as there appears to be general agreement with no important
                        outstanding differences he hopes the treaty can be signed without delay; in
                        fact he would like to see it signed on Thursday<note n="85"
                            xml:id="d278fn85">November 26.</note> in order that the Generalissimo
                        might announce its conclusion at the final meeting of the Central Executive
                        Committee on 28th. I replied that my information led me to believe there are
                        no important outstanding differences but that several of the Chinese
                        proposed amendments are not entirely acceptable in their present form and
                        this might require a very brief delay for consultation and redrafting, but
                        that I know that the American Government is most desirous of early
                        conclusion of the treaty. Referring to the Chinese proposals, Soong said he
                        had sent instructions to the Chinese Ambassador at Washington not to be
                        insistent on them. Referring to the proposed new article I, he said that if
                        it is not entirely acceptable his Ambassador has been told to omit it; and
                        the same with reference to other suggestions. In short, China and America
                        have mutual faith and trust; he regards the broad general lines of the draft
                        treaty as evidencing that faith and trust; and he wants no quibbling and
                        “insistence upon the letter of the law”. He mentioned the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Ta Kung Pao</hi> editorials and said he has no patience with those who
                        propose restrictions on foreigners in China.</p>

                        the following letter, dated November 23, with enclosure, from Mr. Eden

                            <p>We also would like to see the treaties signed within 3 or 4 weeks and
                                intend to make every effort to achieve this. You will observe that
                                there are only two points of any substance on which it remains for
                                us to coordinate our replies to the Chinese Government, namely,
                                national treatment for the carrying on of commerce and the manner in
                                which we should meet the Chinese desire to cover coastal and inland
                                navigation in the present negotiations. These are points on which we
                                feel strongly that we are fully entitled to ask of the Chinese equal
                                and reciprocal treatment and I very much hope that our suggestions
                                will prove acceptable to the Department of State.” End Mr. Eden’s

                    <p>One. (1) The Foreign Office attach the highest importance to the principle
                        that the relations between this country and China to be inaugurated by the
                        present treaty should be firmly based on genuine equality and reciprocity.
                        Nevertheless they are ready to concur in the attitude adopted by the
                        Department of State in regard to the proposal for a new article on this
                        point.</p>
                    <p>(2) and (3) (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), the
                        Foreign Office agree with the articles in question and for the same
                        reasons.</p>
                    <p>(4) As the Department of State are aware, the Foreign Office attach
                        importance to obtaining national treatment in the matter of carrying on
                        commerce in China. His Majesty’s Government are entitled to claim on a basis
                        of equality and reciprocity that this principle should be recognized.
                        Nevertheless the Foreign Office appreciate that the application in detail of
                        this principle is a matter which will [not?] fail to be considered in the
                        later comprehensive treaty. In order to bridge the gap and to meet any
                        qualms the Chinese may have on this subject, the Foreign Office propose to
                        instruct His Majesty’s Ambassador to inform the Chinese that while they wish
                        to retain the words “and the carrying on of commerce” in the second sentence
                        of article VI of the British draft treaty (article V of the American draft)
                        they are prepared to agree to the insertion at the beginning of this
                        sentence of the words “pending the conclusion of the comprehensive treaty
                        mentioned in article VIII” (article VII of the American draft). This
                        sentence is already phrased in a tentative way (“will endeavour to accord”)
                        and the insertion of the additional phrase now proposed should from the
                        Chinese point of view emphasize its provisional character, <pb n="366"
                            xml:id="pg_366" facs="0376"/>while from our own point of view it will
                        establish that this is a matter for later negotiation. The Foreign Office
                        trust that the Department of State will see their way to concurring in this
                        solution.</p>
                    <p>(5) The Foreign Office see no objection to concurring in the proposed
                        amendment to article VII of the British draft treaty. (Article VI of the
                        American draft.)</p>
                    <p>(6) In general the Foreign Office confirm that there is no intention to
                        retain anything which is not normal in international practice. On the other
                        hand, while ready to abandon all inequalities suffered by China, they are
                        not prepared to substitute other inequalities to the detriment of British or
                        any other interests which may be affected by the present treaties. As to the
                        individual points raised:</p>
                    <p>Treaty ports. Inasmuch as we desire to encourage the Chinese Government to
                        open all parts of the country to foreign commerce, travel and residence, we
                        welcome the proposal to declare the abrogation of the “treaty port system”
                        which confined commerce and residence to certain cities. The Foreign Office
                        propose so to reply to the Chinese Government with the object of eliciting
                        from them whether this is indeed what they have in mind.</p>
                    <p>Special courts. The Foreign Office agree that these will disappear.</p>
                    <p>Coastal and inland navigation. See below under three.</p>
                    <p>Pilots. The Foreign Office also assume that the Chinese Government have in
                        mind the general pilotage regulations of 1868.<note n="87" xml:id="d279fn87"

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p. 658.</note> Shanghai is the port
                        chiefly affected by this question, and prior to the war there was at
                        Shanghai, as the Department of State are aware, a Foreign Licensed Pilots’
                        Association functioning under a Sino-foreign charter. Candidates admitted to
                        the Association were required to buy a share in a company formed to own the
                        pilot ships and other property used by the Association. On resignation from
                        the Association members were refunded the amount of their shares. His
                        Majesty’s Government have no wish to retain any special privileges in this
                        respect, but for the safety of big ships (including naval vessels)
                        navigating the difficult entrance to Shanghai they consider that the Chinese
                        Government should be invited to agree to employ a sufficient number of
                        qualified foreign pilots when Shanghai again becomes open to allied shipping
                        and until an adequate number of Chinese pilots can be trained to take their
                        place. It would also be desirable to secure from the Chinese Government an
                        undertaking to assume responsibility for the financial obligation of the
                        Licensed Pilots’ Association toward those of its members whose employment
                        was terminated.</p>
                    <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0377"/>
                    <p>Foreign warships. His Majesty’s Government would not wish to retain any of
                        the special rights which His Majesty’s ships have been accorded in the
                        waters of China. The Foreign Office would suggest that any exchange of notes
                        should acknowledge this and add the following:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“His Majesty’s Government and the Chinese Government shall extend to
                                each other the mutual courtesy of visits by their warships in
                                accordance with international usage.”</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>Two. The Foreign Office would see no objection to exchanging notes on treaty
                        ports, special courts, the employment of pilots and visits of foreign
                        warships on the lines indicated above. They agree that it would be desirable
                        to cover the problem of cases pending before the British courts in China and
                        judgments already delivered in an exchange of notes in the terms proposed by
                        the Department of State, subject to the two following insertions: <list>
                            <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                            <item>at the end of the first sentence:—“… and shall, when necessary, be
                                enforced by the Chinese authorities”;</item>
                            <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                            <item>before the words “be remitted”:—“… if the plaintiff or petitioner
                                so desires”. This is desired in order to cover cases where the
                                parties might prefer to settle, or to submit the dispute to
                                arbitration.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>In rendering the final phrase for the purposes of the British draft treaty it
                        will be necessary to say “apply the laws which a British court would apply”.
                        The Foreign Office assume that there will be no objection to Consuls
                        finishing uncontested probate and administration matters in a nonjudicial
                        capacity. It will also be necessary in matrimonial cases where a decree <hi
                            rend="italic">nisi</hi> has already been granted to arrange for the
                        decree to be made absolute, but it is hoped that this could be done without
                        any explicit provision being required.</p>
                    <p>Three. Points (1) and (3) in this section of the Department of State’s
                        message have already been dealt with above, under One (1) and (4). This
                        leaves outstanding point (2)—inland and coastal navigation.</p>
                    <p>As regards His Majesty’s ships, see under One (6) above. As regards coastal
                        trade and inland navigation by merchant vessels, the Foreign Office think it
                        greatly preferable to adhere, at least in the first instance, to the
                        attitude set out in the memorandum sent to His Excellency the American
                        Ambassador on November 12. In doing so they do not consider that they are
                        attempting to preserve unilateral and unequal privileges in China because in
                        the United Kingdom, the colonies and in India, Chinese shipping is in
                        practice permitted to engage in these trades. The Foreign Office would for
                        instance call the attention of the Department of State to the Burma
                        convention <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0378"/>concluded between Great
                        Britain and China in 1894<note n="88" xml:id="d279fn88">Signed at London,

                        12 reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The British Government, wishing to promote frontier trade between
                                the two countries by encouraging mining enterprize in Yunnan and in
                                the new territorial acquisition of China referred to in the present
                                convention, consent to allow Chinese vessels carrying merchandise,
                                ores, and minerals of all kinds, and coming from or destined for
                                China, freely to navigate the Irrawaddy on the same conditions as to
                                dues and other matters as British vessels.”</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Foreign Office propose that the above should be pointed out to the
                        Chinese Government. If, however, the Chinese Government insist on their
                        request to have the subject of coastal trade and inland navigation included
                        in the proposed exchange of notes, His Majesty’s Government would be
                        prepared to comply on the following lines. His Majesty’s Government would
                        state that they do not reserve any unilateral treaty rights which they
                        possess in respect of coastal trade and inland navigation, in return for
                        which the Chinese Government would state in effect that while reserving the
                        right to limit these trades to the Chinese flag, they would permit the
                        existing practice to continue pending further arrangements.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty’s Government have now received proposals similar to the above
                        from the Chinese Government for the amendment of the British draft treaty
                        and for an exchange of notes. In the British exchange of notes the Chinese
                        Government wish, however, to add to the matters for abrogation already
                        mentioned to the United States Government “the employment of a foreign
                        national as inspector general of the Chinese Maritime Customs.” Since the
                        United States Government are also interested in the Chinese customs and the
                        financial obligations secured thereof His Majesty’s Government would be glad
                        to learn their views on this last mentioned request. They for their part are
                        prepared to agree to the inclusion of this point in the exchange of notes,
                        but they would propose to express the hope that the Chinese Government will
                        continue to maintain the administration of the customs service as at present
                        constituted both in China’s own interest and those of the holders of Chinese
                        bonds secured on the customs revenue.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Government also wish to insert in the Sino-British exchange of
                        notes a final sentence which reads:—“Questions which are not covered by the
                        present treaty and exchange of notes annexed thereto and which affect the
                        sovereignty of the Republic of China shall be discussed by the
                        representatives of the high contracting parties and shall be decided in
                        accordance with the generally accepted principles <pb n="369"
                            xml:id="pg_369" facs="0379"/>of international law and with modern
                        international practice.” The Foreign Office are not clear as to the purpose
                        underlying this proposal and are asking for an explanation.</p>
                    <p>It should be added in conclusion that apart from the questions of common
                        interest to the United States and Great Britain and India, the Chinese
                        Government have asked for the inclusion in article V of the Sino-British
                        treaty of additional clauses terminating the convention for the extension of
                        the Hong Kong territory signed at Peking in 1898.<note n="89"

                        proposed therefore to instruct His Majesty’s Ambassador at once in the sense

                    <p>1. In the light of the modifications of the draft treaty suggested by the
                        Chinese and our proposed counter suggestions, it is believed that, in
                        connection with the question of a supplemental exchange of notes, we might
                        appropriately present to the Chinese a draft text of the contemplated note
                        from the Chinese Government in language somewhat as follows:</p>
                    <p>First paragraph: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Under instruction of my Government, I have the honor to state that
                                in connection with the treaty signed today by the Government of the
                                Republic of China and the Government of the United States of
                                America, in which the Government of the United States of America
                                relinquishes its extraterritorial and related special rights in
                                China, it is the understanding of the Government of the Republic of
                                China that the rights of the Government of the United States of
                                America and of its nationals in regard to the system of treaty ports
                                and of special courts in the International Settlements at Shanghai
                                and Amoy and in regard to the employment of foreign pilots in the

                                ports as such, the Government of the Republic of China desires to
                                make known that the following ports in its territory are considered
                                to be open to overseas merchant shipping of the United States of
                                America: [It is assumed that here the Chinese Government will wish
                                to insert the names of the ports which are normally opened to
                                foreign commerce with, and the overseas merchant shipping of,
                                friendly countries.]<note n="90" xml:id="d280fn1">Brackets appear in

                        of the British Government in regard to the above and other questions
                        concerning the modifications suggested by the Chinese, including of course
                        the further views of the British Government in regard to our proposed new

                        may be added that the Chinese are pressing us for formal reply to the
                        document they handed to us on November 10 and we should, of course, wish to
                        move forward in the matter as soon as practicable.</p>

                    <p>5931. Your 6608, November 24, 2 p.m. It has, of course, been our earnest
                        desire to meet British wishes in regard to various questions in connection
                        with the draft treaty on extraterritoriality and supplemental exchange of
                        notes to the greatest extent that would be compatible with our broad
                        interests and fundamental policies. In response to Mr. Eden’s suggestions
                        contained in your telegram under reference and in the light of the wish of
                        both governments to get forward in the matter, the question what means might
                        be adopted to enable us to come closely to paralleling, if not in all cases
                        adopting, the British suggestions has been given further study and as a
                        result we offer comment and suggestions as the basis of reply to Mr. Eden as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>One. (1) Our suggestion in this respect was contained in our no. 5859,
                        November 21, 3 p.m.</p>
                    <p>(2), (3), (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>). See our
                        5859, November 21, 3 p.m. (With further reference to (3) (<hi rend="italic"
                            >b</hi>) we intend as indicated in our no. 5914, November 24, 7 p.m. to
                        incorporate the Chinese suggestion in full in Article IV of our draft.)</p>
                    <p>(4) The British suggestion in regard to the reference, inserted in Article V
                        of our draft, to “the carrying on of commerce”: As previously explained,
                        this question tends to raise difficult questions of State and Federal
                        jurisdiction in this country. Consequently we have not been happy about the
                        matter; we feel that the fundamental difficulty involved has not been
                        adequately taken care of; and, now that the Chinese have raised objection to
                        the inclusion of the phrase and have pointed out that it involves a matter
                        which most appropriately might be covered by the subsequent comprehensive
                        treaty, we do not feel that we can consistently do other than accept the
                        Chinese suggestion that it be deleted, especially as it is believed that
                        there is little if any possibility of overcoming Chinese opposition to
                        inclusion of the phrase.</p>
                    <p>(5) Agreement has been reached in regard to this question.</p>
                    <p>(6) This question was covered in our no. 5859, November 21, 3 p.m. We now
                        propose, in the light of the modification of the provision concerning
                        coasting trade and inland navigation discussed in paragraph numbered 3 below
                        to insert in the suggested note from the Chinese Government after the
                        reference to treaty ports a sentence as follows: “As regards the question of
                        the treatment of overseas merchant shipping, it is mutually understood that
                        the vessels of each country shall <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0382"
                        />be permitted freely to come into the ports, places, and waters of the
                        other country which are or may be open to overseas merchant shipping and
                        that the treatment accorded such vessels in such ports, places, and waters
                        shall be no less favorable than that accorded to national vessels and shall
                        be as favorable as that accorded to the vessels of any third country.”</p>
                    <p>We do not feel that we can ask the Chinese to agree to continue the
                        employment of foreign pilots but perceive no objection to the British
                        Government, for its part, following its suggestions in this matter. As
                        regards the question of the financial obligations of the Licensed Pilots’
                        Association, it is our view that this question might fall within the purview
                        of the second paragraph of Article VII of our draft.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Warships. We are adopting the British suggestion and now propose to
                        insert in the draft note from the Chinese Government language as follows:
                        “It is mutually understood that the Government of the United States of
                        America relinquishes the special rights which naval vessels of the United
                        States of America have been accorded in the waters of the Republic of China
                        and that the Government of the Republic of China and the Government of the
                        United States of America shall extend to each other the mutual courtesy of
                        visits by their warships in accordance with international usage and
                        comity.”</p>
                    <p>Two. (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) We accept the British suggestion.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) We accept the British suggestion.</p>
                    <p>Three. It seems to us that the divergence of views which has obtained between
                        this Government and the British Government in regard to the questions of
                        coasting trade and inland navigation arise from necessary differences in the
                        practices of the two governments. For example, as previously indicated, we
                        cannot grant the Chinese reciprocal rights in these matters. In the light of
                        our concept of policy toward China, we cannot consistently seek to reserve
                        or retain special rights. However, in consideration of the importance which
                        the British Government attaches to the questions of coasting trade and
                        inland navigation, we are prepared to abandon our proposal that these
                        questions be covered by an additional definitive article and now propose, as
                        a suitable alternative within the necessary framework of our general policy,
                        the insertion in the proposed note from the Chinese Government of language
                        as follows: “While the question of rights in connection with the coasting
                        trade and inland navigation in the waters of the Republic of China is not
                        related to extraterritorial jurisdiction and is a matter which it is
                        appropriate to reserve for the comprehensive treaty of commerce, navigation,
                        et cetera which will be negotiated subsequently by the two governments, it
                        is mutually understood that the Government of the United States of America
                        relinquishes the special rights which vessels of the United States have been
                        accorded <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0383"/>in connection with the
                        coasting trade and inland navigation in waters of the Republic of China and
                        that, while the Government of the Republic of China reserves the right to
                        limit the coasting trade and inland navigation to the Chinese flag, the
                        Government of the Republic of China does not contemplate applying
                        restrictions which would have the effect of making material alterations in
                        the existing practice pending the making of further arrangements between the
                        two governments. It is further understood that it is the concept and
                        intention of the Government of the Republic of China and the Government of
                        the United States of America that questions in regard to coasting trade and
                        inland navigation will be resolved on the basis of what is normal and usual
                        in modern international treaties between friendly countries.”</p>
                    <p>Four. We perceive no objection to the British Government’s expressing to the
                        Chinese Government the hope that the Chinese Government will continue to
                        maintain the administration of the customs service as at present constituted
                        both in China’s own interests and those of the holders of bonds secured by
                        the customs’ revenue. We do not, however, for our part, feel in position to
                        make reference to the matter in the proposed exchange of notes or to make to
                        the Chinese Government any formal representations in the matter in
                        connection with this treaty.</p>
                    <p>Five. As regards the Chinese suggestion that there be inserted in the
                        exchange of notes a sentence in regard to questions “which affect the
                        sovereignty” of China, we assume, and the Chinese Embassy here has indicated
                        to us that it similarly assumes, that this sentence is intended to cover
                        various possible questions such as the employment of a foreign national as
                        Inspector General of the Chinese Maritime Customs, the employment of foreign
                        engineers, et cetera, for certain railways, et cetera. We, for our part, are
                        prepared to accept the Chinese suggestion as indicated in our no. 5914,
                        November 24, 7 p.m.</p>
                    <p>Six. It is believed that, with the above, we have now reached substantial
                        agreement with the British Government or have come as closely as is possible
                        within the necessary framework of our concepts, policies, and practices to
                        paralleling the British suggestions. We accordingly expect, unless the
                        British Government has in mind modifications that will be compatible with
                        the requirements of the situation from the point of view which we feel
                        impelled to adopt, to proceed, along the lines we have indicated, with the
                        preparation of a document to be handed to the Chinese Embassy on Friday,
                        November 27 (or at the latest on Saturday, November 28) in reply to the
                        Chinese document presented to us on November 10.</p>

                    <p>1152. Your 1385, November 24, 1 p.m. In the light of Dr. Soong’s statements
                        on the subject of the draft treaty on extraterritoriality, especially those
                        in regard to his instructions to the Chinese Ambassador here, it is believed
                        that the negotiations may be regarded for all practical purposes as having
                        been concluded. While it will not be possible to sign the treaty today or
                        within the next few days because we must meanwhile obtain formal acceptance
                        by the Chinese of our reply to their document of November 10, it is
                        suggested that the purposes which Dr. Soong seems to have in mind in
                        connection with the current session of the Central Executive Committee might
                        be served by announcement by the Generalissimo at the final meeting of the
                        Committee on November 28 to the effect that the negotiations have been
                        concluded and that this Government and the Chinese Government are in
                        agreement in regard to the draft text of the treaty.</p>
                    <p>We expect to hand to the Chinese Embassy here on Friday, November 27, our
                        reply to their document of November 10. Our reply will represent a most
                        earnest effort to meet Chinese wishes. Our counter-suggestions are largely
                        concerned with matters of phraseology and, except possibly for questions of
                        coasting trade and inland navigation (which have not been discussed in any
                        detail with Chinese representatives here), our impression from our
                        discussions with the Chinese is that our counter-suggestions will be readily
                        acceptable to the Chinese. Our suggestions in regard to coasting trade and
                        inland navigation were formulated in the light of Chinese insistence that
                        these questions be covered in the draft treaty or notes supplemental
                        thereto. We believe that they also should be acceptable to the Chinese, but
                        if not these two matters can well be reserved for negotiation in connection
                        with the comprehensive treaty on commerce, navigation, et cetera which the
                        two Governments expect to conclude subsequently, especially as they have no
                        actual relation to the question of extraterritorial jurisdiction and would
                        much more appropriately fall within the purview of the contemplated
                        comprehensive treaty.</p>

                    <p>6681. I have just received from Mr. Eden a letter dated November 26 enclosing
                        the following comments on the Department’s 5859, November 21, 3 p.m.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <list>
                            <item>“(1) If it should prove necessary to make provision for ‘most
                                favored nation treatment’ in any respect in the present treaty
                                (which is not at present the case) the Foreign Office are ready to
                                adopt the expedient suggested by the Department of State. As regards
                                coastal trade and inland navigation, please see under section three
                                of the Foreign Office memorandum of the 23rd November (Embassy’s
                                6608, November 24, 2 p.m.)</item>
                            <item>(2) The Foreign Office would be grateful to be informed of the
                                reception which the Chinese Government give to the proposal for
                                expanding the preamble. For their part they would have no objection
                                to introducing the principle of equality in this way into the
                                British treaty. It should be mentioned that the Chinese Government
                                have proposed the omission of the words ‘and for this purpose do
                                settle certain matters relating to jurisdiction in China’ from the
                                preamble of the British draft.</item>
                            <item>(3) It seems to the Foreign Office preferable to retain the
                                original wording of the second paragraphs of articles II and III of
                                the United States treaty if this can conveniently be done, since the
                                phrase concerning ‘legitimate rights’ provides some protection for
                                respectable private interests in the areas which are being handed
                                over. It is not our intention to ask that such interests should be
                                indefinitely maintained if they are in conflict with the Chinese
                                laws and regulations; but it is reasonable to require that if they
                                are expropriated or otherwise liquidated adequate compensation
                                should be paid. The Foreign Office would suggest that the matter be
                                further discussed with the Chinese Government on these lines.</item>
                            <item>(4) The Foreign Office agree with the proposed amendment of
                                article IV (article V of the British draft) which should be
                                satisfactory to the Chinese Government.”</item>

                        extraterritoriality to read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The United States of America and the Republic of China, in

                                between their two peoples and of their common desire as equal and

                        possible extent with the British Government, to suggest that the signing of
                        the treaty be deferred for a few days, say, approximately 10 days, and to
                        say that we hope that our treaty with the Chinese and the British treaty
                        with the Chinese may be signed at about the same time.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Liu called at the Department, upon request, at 4:00 p.m. today in the
                        absence from Washington of the Chinese Ambassador and was received by Mr.
                        Hornbeck and Mr. Atcheson.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hornbeck stated to him that we had prepared a reply to the Chinese
                        document of November 10 suggesting a number of modifications of the draft
                        treaty; that in making the counter-suggestions contained in our reply we had
                        exerted our best efforts to meet Chinese wishes and felt that we had now
                        come close to complete agreement and that negotiations in the matter could
                        be regarded as practically ended; and that as regards the Chinese
                        suggestions for an additional article to be Article I we had formulated a
                        new preamble for the treaty which we felt would go far toward meeting
                        Chinese desires in that respect.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hornbeck then asked Mr. Liu to read the new preamble, which Mr. Liu did
                        with apparent satisfaction, and Mr. Atcheson mentioned that he thought that
                        the reference therein to the United States and China “as equal and sovereign
                        States” very closely approached what <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0387"
                        />the Chinese had in mind in connection with their suggested new Article
                        I.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hornbeck went on to say that we had had intimations that Dr. Soong, the
                        Chinese Foreign Minister, now in Chungking, felt about as we did that the
                        negotiations were practically, except for matters of phraseology, at an end,
                        and that agreement had been reached. Mr. Liu replied that the Chinese
                        Embassy here had also received indications that Dr. Soong felt as we did and
                        that the Chinese side should not be too insistent in regard to its
                        suggestions for modification of the draft.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hornbeck stated that we proposed that the treaty be signed in roughly ten
                        days’ time; that this period would permit the British to catch up; that we
                        thought it would be appropriate if our treaty with the Chinese and the
                        British treaty with the Chinese should be signed at about the same time,
                        although not necessarily at the same hour or on the same day; that we had no
                        idea, and we were sure that the Chinese had no idea, of rushing the British
                        in the matter and we did not wish to create an impression anywhere that we
                        had any desire to “scoop” the British; that the British had been most
                        cooperative in connection with the whole question and we appreciated that
                        and we also appreciated the willing understanding and cooperation shown by
                        the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Liu stated that he would have the document telegraphed to Chungking,
                        thanked Mr. Hornbeck for the Department’s efforts, and then accompanied Mr.
                        Atcheson to the latter’s office.</p>
                    <p>In Mr. Atcheson’s office Mr. Liu read over the document carefully and there
                        ensued some informal discussion of various points. Mr. Liu expressed himself
                        as feeling that the Chinese Government would be very gratified with the
                        suggested new preamble and would be gratified with our reply on the whole,
                        adding that there seemed to be nothing in the way of phraseology which could
                        not be readily adjusted.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Atcheson remarked that, in regard to the question of inland navigation
                        and coasting trade, these matters were not related to extraterritoriality
                        and perhaps might more appropriately be covered in the later comprehensive
                        treaty which the two Governments contemplated. He said further that, as Dr.
                        Soong had mentioned these matters before his return to China and as the
                        Chinese Embassy had brought them up several times, we had attempted to cover
                        them in a general way in the proposed supplemental exchange of notes; that
                        we had tried to meet Chinese wishes in the matter; that there appeared to be
                        one of three things which might be done in regard to those questions: the
                        handling of them in the supplemental exchange of notes as suggested in our
                        document of today, the insertion in the treaty of a full article along the
                        lines of the articles on those subjects in our <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378"
                            facs="0388"/>modern comprehensive treaties with other countries, or just
                        dropping the matters and reserving them for discussion in the later treaty
                        with China.</p>
                    <p>As regards the reference in the supplemental note to cases pending before the
                        United States Court for China and the American Consular Courts in China, Mr.
                        Atcheson stated that it was our understanding that these cases consisted of
                        one or two bank receiverships and a number of estate cases; that the Swiss
                        authorities were at the present time administering some of the estate cases
                        in an informal manner and we assumed that if any of them continued pending
                        after the war there would be no objection on the part of the Chinese
                        Government to their being administered informally by our Consuls in the same
                        manner that consular officers in many countries handled such matters. Mr.
                        Liu said that he was sure that there would be no objection to such
                        procedure.</p>
                    <p>Upon his departure Mr. Liu made repeated expressions of thanks for the
                        Department’s efforts in the matter.</p>

                    <p>Careful consideration has been given to the suggested modifications of the
                        draft treaty on extraterritoriality which the Department received from the
                        Chinese Embassy on November 10, 1942.</p>
                    <p>One. As regards paragraph one of the Chinese suggestions, the Government of
                        the United States suggests, in a sincere desire to meet appropriately the
                        wishes of the Chinese Government in this matter, that this question might
                        appropriately be covered in the preamble of the treaty and that the language
                        of the preamble accordingly might be altered to read as follows: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The United States of America and the Republic of China, in
                                recognition of the friendly relations which have long prevailed
                                between their two peoples and of their common desire as equal and
                                sovereign States that the high principles in the regulation of human
                                affairs to which they are committed shall be made increasingly
                                effective, have resolved to conclude a treaty for the adjustment of
                                certain matters in regard to jurisdiction in China and related
                                questions, and have appointed et cetera.”</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>Two. As regards paragraph two of the Chinese suggestions, it may be mentioned
                        that the adjective “legitimate” was used in the American <pb n="379"
                            xml:id="pg_379" facs="0389"/>draft to describe the rights in question
                        and it would accordingly seem that the additional language suggested by the
                        Chinese Government is not necessary. However, if after further consideration
                        the Chinese Government should prefer, the Government of the United States
                        for its part would be willing to delete from the end of the second paragraph
                        of Articles II and III of the American draft treaty the words “and for the
                        recognition and protection of all legitimate rights therein”, thereby
                        eliminating any basis for the additional clause in question suggested by the
                        Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>Three. (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) As regards the first item of paragraph
                        three of the Chinese suggestions, the Government of the United States would
                        be agreeable, if it is considered by the Chinese Government that the term
                        “fraud” in the American draft is too narrow in a technical legal sense, to
                        altering the particular language in question to read, “it is agreed that
                        such existing rights or titles shall be indefeasible and shall not be
                        questioned upon any ground except upon proof, established through due
                        process of law, of fraud or of fraudulent or other dishonest practices in
                        the acquisition of such rights or titles, it being understood that no right
                        or title shall be rendered invalid by virtue of any subsequent change in the
                        official procedure through which it was acquired”.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) The Government of the United States concurs in the
                        addition in the second paragraph of Article IV of the American draft of the
                        first part of the proposed sentence, as follows: “It is also agreed that
                        these rights or titles shall be subject to the laws and regulations of the
                        Republic of China concerning taxation, national defense and the right of
                        eminent domain.” As regards the further language proposed by the Chinese
                        Government that such rights or titles may not be alienated to the government
                        or nationals of any third country without the express consent of the Chinese
                        Government, if after further consideration the Chinese Government continues
                        in its desire to include in Article IV a provision along those lines, the
                        Government of the United States would not be inclined to raise objection
                        provided that the Chinese Government for its part should see its way clear
                        to making a declaration in a supplemental note to the effect that the
                        restriction on the right of alienation of existing rights and titles to real
                        property in question would be applied in an equitable manner and that if and
                        when the Chinese Government should decline to give assent to a proposed
                        transfer the Chinese Government would undertake, if the American party in
                        interest should so desire, to take over the right or title in question and
                        pay adequate compensation therefor.</p>
                    <p>Four. The Government of the United States is prepared, in response to the
                        wish of the Chinese Government, to concur in the deletion from Article V of
                        the American draft of the words “and to the carrying <pb n="380"
                            xml:id="pg_380" facs="0390"/>on of commerce”, and is agreeable to
                        deferment of this subject for regulation in the comprehensive treaty to be
                        negotiated in future.</p>
                    <p>Five. As regards the amendment to Article VI of the American draft proposed
                        by the Chinese Government, it has been the concept and assumption of the
                        Government of the United States that upon the abolition of
                        extraterritoriality and related special rights in China the Chinese
                        Government would of course wish to accord to the United States, its officers
                        and other nationals rights similar to those normally enjoyed in friendly
                        countries under modern international practice. In the light of this concept
                        and assumption and of the favorable attitude which this Government has
                        adopted and is prepared to continue toward requests of the Chinese
                        Government for the opening of Chinese consular offices in American
                        territory, and in the expectation that the Chinese Government would not
                        perceive objection to the opening of American consular offices at such
                        places in China as would be appropriate, this Government would be inclined
                        not to raise objection to the suggested change.</p>
                    <p>Six. As mentioned heretofore, it has been the concept of the Government of
                        the United States that the interests of both countries could best be served
                        at this time by the conclusion of a brief treaty along broad general lines
                        and containing no unnecessary particularization. Nevertheless, while some of
                        the matters mentioned in the suggested exchange of notes (such as special
                        courts in the International Settlements at Shanghai and Amoy) would seem to
                        be covered in general by the provisions of the draft treaty, and some other
                        points (such as inland navigation and the visits of foreign warships) are
                        not actually related to the question of extraterritoriality, the Government
                        of the United States perceives no objection to an exchange of notes covering
                        various matters of interest to either Government.</p>
                    <p>In this connection there is appended a suggested new draft note from the
                        Chinese Government to cover various questions raised by the Chinese
                        Government, including the questions of coasting trade, inland navigation and
                        visits of naval vessels, as well as matters which the Government of the
                        United States would, for its part, wish to be covered in such exchange of
                        notes. As regards the questions of coasting trade, inland navigation and
                        visits of naval vessels, these questions were mentioned by the Chinese
                        Foreign Minister before his recent departure for China and the Chinese
                        Government appears to desire that these subjects be covered in the exchange
                        of notes supplemental to the treaty; accordingly the Government of the
                        United States has endeavored to meet the Chinese wishes in this respect in
                        an appropriate manner.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: Under instruction of my
                            Government, I have the honor to state that in connection with the treaty
                            signed today by the Government of the Republic of China and the
                            Government of the United States of America, in which the Government of
                            the United States of America relinquishes its extraterritorial and
                            related special rights in China, it is the understanding of the
                            Government of the Republic of China that the rights of the Government of
                            the United States of America and of its nationals in regard to the
                            systems of treaty ports and of special courts in the International
                            Settlements at Shanghai and Amoy and in regard to the employment of
                            foreign pilots in the ports of the territory of China are also
                            relinquished. In the light of the abolition of treaty ports as such, the
                            Government of the Republic of China desires to make known that the
                            following ports in its territory are considered to be open to overseas
                            merchant shipping of the United States of America: [It is assumed that

                        <p>As regards the question of the treatment of overseas merchant shipping,
                            it is mutually understood that the vessels of each country shall be
                            permitted freely to come to the ports, places, and waters of the other
                            country which are or may be open to overseas merchant shipping and that
                            the treatment accorded such vessels in such ports, places, and waters
                            shall be no less favorable than that accorded to national vessels and
                            shall be as favorable as that accorded to the vessels of any third
                            country.</p>
                        <p>It is mutually understood that the Government of the United States of
                            America relinquishes the special rights which naval vessels of the
                            United States of America have been accorded in the waters of the
                            Republic of China and that the Government of the Republic of China and
                            the Government of the United States of America shall extend to each
                            other the mutual courtesy of visits by their warships in accordance with
                            international usage and comity.</p>
                        <p>While the question of rights in connection with the coasting trade and
                            inland navigation in the waters of the Republic of China is not related
                            to extraterritorial jurisdiction and is a matter which it is appropriate
                            to reserve for the comprehensive treaty of commerce, navigation, et
                            cetera which is to be negotiated subsequently by the two Governments, it
                            is mutually understood that the Government of the <pb n="382"
                                xml:id="pg_382" facs="0392"/>United States of America relinquishes
                            the special rights which vessels of the United States have been accorded
                            in connection with the coasting trade and inland navigation in waters of
                            the Republic of China and that, while the Government of the Republic of
                            China reserves the right to limit the coasting trade and inland
                            navigation to the Chinese flag, the Government of the Republic of China
                            does not contemplate applying restrictions which would have the effect
                            of making material alterations in the existing practice pending the
                            making of further arrangements between the two Governments. It is
                            further understood that it is the concept and intention of the
                            Government of the Republic of China and the Government of the United
                            States of America that questions in regard to coasting trade and inland
                            navigation will be resolved on the basis of what is normal and usual in
                            modern international practice between friendly countries.</p>
                        <p>It is mutually understood that questions which are not covered by the
                            present treaty and exchange of notes and which may affect the
                            sovereignty of the Republic of China shall be discussed by
                            representatives of the two Governments and shall be decided in
                            accordance with generally accepted principles of international law and
                            with modern international practice.</p>
                        <p>[If the Chinese suggestion of a reference to a restriction on the right
                            of alienation of existing rights and titles to real property is included
                            in Article IV:]<note n="95" xml:id="d286fn95">Brackets appear in the

                            referred to in that article will be applied by the Chinese authorities
                            in an equitable manner and that if and when the Chinese Government
                            declines to give assent to a proposed transfer the Chinese Government
                            will, in a spirit of justice and with a view to precluding loss on the
                            part of American nationals whose interests are affected, undertake, if
                            the American party in interest so desires, to take over the right or
                            title in question and to pay adequate compensation therefor.</p>
                        <p>It is mutually understood that the orders, decrees, judgments, decisions
                            and other acts of the United States Court for China and of the Consular

                    <p>6708. Department’s 5931, November 25. The following letter has just been
                        handed to me from Mr. Eden. I am telegraphing it on to you at once.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>“The Foreign Office greatly regret the decision of the Department of
                            State not to ask for national treatment in the carrying on of commerce.
                            They hope that this decision may yet be reconsidered in the light of
                                (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the serious effect which the omission
                            would have on the later comprehensive treaty in a matter of such capital
                            importance; and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the fact that the relevant
                            article as drafted between us is in a highly tentative form. “Will
                            endeavour to accord etc.” This matter is to be considered by the Cabinet
                            on Monday, 30th November, and the Foreign Office very much hope that the
                            American communication to the Chinese Embassy can be delayed until
                            then.</p>
                        <p>As at present advised, the Foreign Office think it most likely that the
                            Cabinet will feel unable in any event to abandon the principle of
                            national treatment for our commerce in China to which they attach great
                            importance. It is probable, therefore, that they will decide that this
                            point should be insisted upon with the Chinese Government though they
                            would naturally regret having to do this alone.”</p>

                    <p>1407. In conversation with me this morning Foreign Minister referred to the
                        American reply to Chinese proposals regarding treaty and said that China
                        would like to stick to the original text of proposed exchange of notes so
                        far as concerns inland navigation and coastal shipping. He said China places
                        much importance on this point. He remarked that heretofore the only American
                        observation on proposed exchange of notes had been to suggest insertion of
                        word <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0394"/>foreign before word pilots. He
                        is instructing Chinese Ambassador Washington but said that meanwhile he
                        wished to mention matter to me. He made no other comments regarding
                        treaty.</p>
                    <p>British Ambassador tells me that London has asked for an explanation of what
                        is meant in last sentence of Chinese draft of exchange of notes by statement
                        in regard to discussion and settlement of matters which affect Chinese
                        sovereignty. He proposes to ask Foreign Minister for explanation.</p>

                    <p>1170. Your 1407, November 30, 3 p.m., treaty on extraterritoriality. As
                        indicated in the document handed to the Chinese Embassy by the Department on
                        November 27, mention of the questions of coasting trade and inland
                        navigation by Dr. Soong before his departure for China and the raising of
                        them since in the Chinese document of November 10 and orally by the Chinese
                        Embassy led us to believe that the Chinese Government desired that they be
                        covered in connection with the treaty and we accordingly made endeavor to
                        meet the Chinese wishes in this respect in an appropriate manner. In handing
                        to the Chinese Minister Counselor on November 27 our document in reply to
                        the Chinese document of November 10, we remarked to him that the questions
                        of inland navigation and coasting trade were not related to
                        extraterritoriality and might more appropriately be covered in the later
                        comprehensive treaty which the two Governments contemplate; and that there
                        appeared to be one of three things which might be done in regard to those
                        questions: the handling of them in a supplemental exchange of notes as
                        suggested in our document of November 27, the insertion in the treaty of a
                        full article along the lines of the articles on those subjects in our modern
                        comprehensive treaties with other countries (Department’s 1075, November 13,

                        and reserving them for discussion in connection with the later treaty.</p>
                    <p>We do not have any especial choice in the matter, our principal desire having
                        been to meet Chinese wishes in so far as practicable. However, <pb n="385"
                            xml:id="pg_385" facs="0395"/>in the light of the fact that, as
                        previously mentioned, the matters in question do not have actual relation to
                        extraterritoriality and might more appropriately be reserved for the later
                        comprehensive treaty in the same way that the question of “the carrying on
                        of commerce” in connection with Article V of our draft is being reserved for
                        the later treaty at the request of the Chinese Government, we suggest that
                        the solution of the problem for the present would be to omit any reference
                        to coasting trade and inland navigation in the present treaty or
                        supplemental notes.</p>
                    <p>In the light of Dr. Soong’s remarks to you we now propose to make this
                        suggestion to the Chinese Embassy here, but leaving the matter open for
                        choice by the Chinese, and we request that you also, as a possible means of
                        saving time, inform Dr. Soong of our views, hand him a copy of the article
                        on coasting trade and inland navigation which we previously had in mind, and
                        request that he indicate his preference.</p>

                    <p>1427. For the Secretary and the Under Secretary. Your No. 1170, December 1, 2
                        p.m., received this morning. I saw Foreign Minister this afternoon and
                        carried out your instructions. He has already instructed Chinese Embassy in
                        reply to our document of November 27 and in reference to coastal trade and
                        inland navigation [that he?] desires simple statement of relinquishment with
                        added clause that China is prepared to take over any American properties
                        that may have been engaged for those purposes and to pay adequate
                        compensation therefor.</p>
                    <p>He does not wish to postpone this subject for treatment in later
                        comprehensive treaty and when I asked him why he desired to cover matter by
                        exchange of notes instead of an article in the brief treaty along the lines
                        you propose he stated that a forthright relinquishment of these rights in
                        simple language in the exchange of notes would have more popular appeal and
                        appreciation in China than an article in the treaty saying China’s inland
                        and coastal trade are to be regulated by the laws of the country. He pointed
                        out that exchange of notes covers matter of overseas vessels along lines of
                        our proposed draft treaty article and there remains only question of inland
                        and coastal trade which he deemed adequately covered by his answer to our
                        document of November 27. He stated that China does not propose to allow
                        foreign flag vessels in coastal and inland trade.</p>
                    <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0396"/>
                    <p>I pointed out that the last sentence of our draft treaty article seemed
                        merely to ensure that we would be given as favorable treatment as any other
                        nations or not be given treatment less favorable than other nations should
                        China at any time decide in any way to permit the participation of foreign
                        flag vessels of any nation in coastal shipping or inland navigation. He
                        finally said he would consider adding to proposed paragraph in exchange of
                        notes a provision that should China later in any way extend the right of
                        inland navigation or participation in coastal trade to vessels of any third
                        nation such rights would similarly be extended to vessels of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>On question of ports open to overseas trade, he said there is no intention of
                        naming ports but simply to refer to the coastal ports open to trade. May I
                        point out to Department that therefore [<hi rend="italic">heretofore?</hi>]
                        Hankow and other lower Yangtze ports have been open to overseas vessels
                        during high water season. When I inquired of Soong whether for example
                        Hankow would be open to overseas vessels for direct delivery and loading of
                        cargo in overseas trade he replied in the negative but showed interest when
                        I commented that in the past this had facilitated foreign trade by
                        permitting direct shipments without heavy cost of transshipments.</p>

                    <p>6870. I give below the text of a letter from Mr. Eden dated December 4.

                            <p>With regard to the suggestion made in the second message enclosed in
                                your letter of the 28th November, we readily concur in the proposal
                                    <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0397"/>that the Netherlands’
                                Foreign Minister should be furnished in strict confidence with the
                                revised texts of the draft treaty. I shall arrange for a copy of our
                                revised text to be communicated to Dr. Van Kleffens.</p>
                            <p>We have also been approached several times by the Norwegian
                                Government who have informed the Chinese Government of their support
                                of the declarations made to the Chinese by the United States
                                Government and ourselves on the 9th October and are anxious to
                                negotiate forthwith a treaty of their own. Provided the Department
                                of State sees no objection I shall also furnish the Norwegian
                                Government with a copy of the revised text.</p>
                            <p>Instructions were sent on the 30th November to Sir Horace
                                    Seymour<note n="3" xml:id="d291fn3">British Ambassador in
                                    China.</note> to reply to the counter-proposals of the Chinese
                                Government and I enclose herein a copy of the revised draft text of
                                our own treaty, together with a draft supplementary note based on
                                these instructions.</p>
                            <p>It will be seen that the amendments which Sir Horace Seymour has been
                                authorized to offer follow closely those offered by the United
                                States Government except in the following two matters:</p>
                            <p>(1) National treatment for the carrying on of commerce.</p>
                            <p>I must confirm the views which I have expressed in previous
                                communications on this subject which are those of His Majesty’s
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>(2) Overseas merchant shipping (see point 7 in the message from the
                                Department of State dated 29th November). (Department’s 6022,
                                November 29, noon.)</p>
                            <p>We had assumed that the message of the 25th November (see point One
                                (6)) (Department’s 5931, November 25, 7 p.m.) superseded the
                                observations on this subject in the message of the previous day (see
                                1: first paragraph).<note n="4" xml:id="d291fn4">November 24, 7
                                    p.m., <ref target="#pg_369">p. 369</ref>.</note> Proceeding on
                                this assumption, we have omitted from our exchange of notes any
                                reference to a list of open ports, especially since we had hoped
                                that with the abolition of the treaty port system it was not the
                                intention of the Chinese Government to continue to confine foreign
                                overseas shipping to particular ports. You will have in mind the
                                observations on this point made in the memorandum contained in my
                                letter of the 23rd November, under One (6) (Embassy’s 6608, November
                                24, 2 p.m.).</p>
                            <p>It will be noted that paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of the annex to be
                                attached to the Sino-British exchange of notes deal respectively
                                with the following subjects:</p>
                            <p>Restrictions on the right of travel, residence and the carrying on of
                                commerce.</p>
                            <p>Owing to special difficulties in some of the British territories to
                                which the treaty applies, e. g. India, it will probably be necessary
                                for us in the exchange of notes, or in an agreed minute, to
                                stipulate that <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0398"/>nothing in
                                the treaty shall prevent (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) application of

                                the nationals of one party in the territories of the other, if the
                                same restrictions are also applied to the nationals of the latter:
                                    (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the application in wartime of
                                restrictions on travel and residence by the nationals of one party,
                                imposed for the purpose of national security in the territories of
                                the other, if the same restrictions are imposed upon all
                                foreigners.</p>
                            <p>Personal status.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty’s Government will seek Chinese agreement to the inclusion
                                in the exchange of notes of a mutual arrangement regarding the law
                                to be applied by the courts in all matters of personal status; and
                                also if possible a declaration by the Chinese Government specifying
                                the courts and prisons in which British subjects may be tried and
                                detained.</p>
                            <p>Real property.</p>
                            <p>The future right to acquire real property in China is regarded as of
                                great importance to British interests, and, since reciprocity can be
                                granted in the United Kingdom and in the British colonies, His
                                Majesty’s Ambassador has been authorized to endeavor to negotiate a
                                reciprocal arrangement covering this question, as otherwise British
                                subjects will be placed at a disadvantage with the nationals of
                                Belgium, Denmark, Portugal and Spain, whose Governments concluded
                                treaties with China in 1928 containing a declaration on this point.
                                It may, however, be necessary to exclude India and Burma from the
                                scope of any such arrangement.</p>
                            <p>On the question of alienation of real property we are agreeing to the
                                restricting phrase at the end of article V (1) on the clear
                                understanding that the Chinese Government agree to paragraph 2 of
                                the annex to the draft exchange of notes. We presume that the United
                                States Government will continue to insist on a similar condition.”

                    <p>1193. Your 1427, December 3, 3 p.m.</p>
                    <p>1. Dr. Soong’s reference to his desire for a simple statement of “forthright
                        relinquishment” of rights of inland navigation and coasting trade leads us
                        to wonder whether our 1170, December 1, 2 p.m., was garbled or not clearly
                        understood, as the first paragraph of our proposed article reads: “The
                        Government of the United States of America relinquishes the special rights
                        which vessels of the United States of America have been accorded with regard
                        to the coasting trade and inland navigation in the waters of the Republic of
                        China.” If the text you furnished Dr. Soong did not include this paragraph
                        please communicate it to him immediately.</p>
                    <p>In any case please call upon the Chinese Foreign Minister as soon as
                        feasible. You may in your discretion say to him, as we have said to Chinese
                        representatives here, that in proposing the brief treaty our concept has
                        been that it would effect abolition of extraterritorial and other special
                        rights and take care of such related matters as would require attention
                        because of abolition of extraterritoriality; that we had hoped to avoid
                        extraneous matters and matters of particularization which might cause the
                        negotiations to be prolonged and which might more appropriately be reserved
                        for the later comprehensive treaty; that we have had no thought of seeking
                        to reserve or obtain anything that is not usual and normal in modern
                        international practice between friendly countries; that in a wholehearted
                        spirit of friendship and a similarly wholehearted desire to wipe out
                        existing anomalies in our relations with China, we have not made any effort
                        to bargain; that we have of course gone on the assumption that the Chinese
                        Government has had in mind objectives identical with ours and would wish, as
                        strongly as we wish, to see our relations placed through the medium of the
                        brief treaty upon the basis of what is normal, usual, equitable and
                        just.</p>
                    <p>In the light of these considerations we feel that, now that purely commercial
                        matters have been brought into the discussions, it is only reasonable and
                        fair for us to expect that the Chinese Government would not desire that the
                        treaty or exchange of notes have any appearance of providing for possible
                        discrimination against American commercial interests as compared to the
                        commercial interests of any other countries.</p>
                    <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0400"/>
                    <p>Dr. Soong will realize, we are sure, that we here also have problems of
                        public and official opinion and that we would be subject to heavy criticism
                        if in concluding agreements with other countries we do not take care to
                        provide for equitable and legitimate protection of American commercial
                        interests. For that reason we proposed as our second preference the full
                        draft article on inland navigation and coasting trade along the lines of
                        articles on those subjects in our modern treaties with other countries. We
                        feel strongly that if our relinquishment of existing rights with respect to
                        those matters is covered in the treaty or in the proposed exchange of notes,
                        the question of our rights vis-à-vis rights of third countries should also
                        be adequately covered. The formula Dr. Soong is considering does not, in the
                        form which he mentioned, accomplish that purpose.</p>
                    <p>2. We have not yet received from the Chinese Embassy here its reply to our
                        document of November 27.</p>

                            <p>I enclose herein our comments on this subject which I hope will be
                                taken into consideration by your Government. It is nevertheless to
                                be feared that as a draft article making the maximum concession to
                                the Chinese has already been shown to the Chinese Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs the possibilities of negotiation will have been
                                severely limited.</p>
                            <p>I take this opportunity to point out that on several occasions in the
                                latest phase of the discussions the United States Government have,
                                with the object of saving time, conceded to the Chinese points of
                                great importance to His Majesty’s Government before our Ambassador
                                in Chungking could be in a position to discuss them with the Chinese
                                Government.</p>
                            <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0401"/>
                            <p>While we realize the political advantages of concluding an agreement
                                without undue delay and appreciate to the full the collaboration of
                                the United States Government in this matter, we are dealing with
                                questions of the greatest importance to our commercial, financial
                                and shipping interests in the Far East and the decisions which we
                                reach now will have an inevitable effect on the negotiations for the
                                comprehensive modern treaty to be concluded subsequently. We should
                                have hoped therefore that before these decisions were taken we
                                should have had sufficient time to consider the points at issue and
                                to arrive at an agreement with the Chinese Government by orderly
                                process of negotiation.</p>
                            <p>We do not feel that the reasons given by the Chinese Minister
                                Counsellor in Washington for asking that the whole matter should be
                                rushed through within a very brief period were of sufficient weight
                                to override these considerations; and indeed according to my
                                information the last session of the Central Executive Committee of
                                the Kuomintang took place on the 2d December.</p>
                            <p>I observe from the Department of State dated 27th November
                                (Department’s 5960, November 27, 3 p.m.) contained in your letter of
                                the 28th November that the Department intend, for the sole purpose
                                of cooperating with His Majesty’s Government, to suggest to the
                                Chinese that the signing of the treaty be deferred for approximately
                                10 days. I shall be grateful if you will inform me from what date
                                the 10 days will run.” End Mr. Eden’s letter.</p>

                            <p>The Foreign Office greatly prefer the original suggestion made in the
                                Department’s communication to the Chinese Embassy of 27th November.

                                make a similar proposal and we propose that he should make every
                                effort to secure its acceptance. We trust that the Department of
                                State will feel able to do the same.</p>
                            <p>If this cannot be achieved we should prefer that the whole matter

                                inclusion of an article on the lines proposed, since its insertion
                                in the United States treaty would make <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392"

                    <p>After having given careful consideration to the memorandum of the United
                        States Government proposing certain modifications to the draft treaty, and
                        the accompanying exchange of notes, the Chinese Government, in view of the
                        particularly cordial relations existing between the two countries, has
                        decided to accept all the proposed modifications of the United States
                        Government, with the sole exception of that paragraph which concerns
                        coasting trade and inland navigation in the waters of the Republic of China.
                        The Chinese people attach the highest importance to the question of coasting
                        trade and inland navigation, and in consequence the Chinese Government is
                        specially anxious that it be dealt with in as clear-cut a manner as the
                        question of visits by foreign warships in Chinese territorial waters.
                        Accordingly, the Chinese Government desires to state as follows.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Liu called by appointment at three o’clock this afternoon. He handed me
                        the Chinese reply, dated December 7,<note n="8" xml:id="d296fn8">
                            <hi rend="italic">Supra.</hi>
                        </note> copy attached, to our document of November 27, and requested that I
                        read it and give him my comment. Mr. Liu remarked that he thought that we
                        were now “very close together” in the matter.</p>
                    <p>I read over the document and said that it seemed to me from this casual
                        reading that we had, as he mentioned, become very close in the matter and
                        that there appeared to remain chiefly only one point of much importance for
                        further discussion—the interrelated questions of inland navigation and
                        coasting trade. I pointed out to Mr. Liu what was apparently an error,
                        possibly resulting from poor telegraphic transmission, in paragraph B (1)
                        (page three) of the document, and Mr. Liu corrected it after telephoning to
                        the Chinese Embassy.</p>
                    <p>As regards the questions of inland navigation and coasting trade, I said that
                        we had heard from Ambassador Gauss in Chungking to the effect that the
                        Chinese Foreign Minister had had in mind proposing the formula suggested in
                        the last sentence of the quoted portion of paragraph B (3) (page 4) of the
                        Chinese document of December 7. I went on to make comment along the lines of
                        the Department’s telegram to Chungking, no. 1193, of December 6, 2 p.m.,
                        including the statements, which I emphasized, (1) that we were sure that the
                        Chinese Government would not wish that there be in the treaty or exchange of
                        notes any appearance of providing for possible discrimination against our
                        commercial interests as compared to the commercial interests of any other
                        countries and (2) that it was only reasonable and fair for us to expect
                        that, if the treaty or proposed exchange of notes covered our relinquishment
                        of existing rights in inland navigation <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395"
                            facs="0405"/>and coasting trade, there should also be adequately covered
                        the question of our rights vis-à-vis rights of third countries.</p>
                    <p>I carefully explained to Mr. Liu the reasons for our feeling strongly in this
                        regard. I said that the American people, we were sure, were whole-heartedly
                        in favor of the relinquishment of our extraterritorial rights in China. I
                        said that I felt that the American people as a whole would also approve of
                        the relinquishment of special rights not actually related to
                        extraterritoriality such as our special rights of inland navigation and
                        coasting trade; but I was also sure that we would be subject to heavy
                        criticism if the treaty or exchange of notes contained language which <hi
                            rend="italic">prima facie</hi> indicated that the way was left open for
                        discrimination against American commercial rights as compared to the rights
                        of third countries. I said that it was a cardinal tenet of our commercial
                        treaty policy to ensure in any treaties or agreements with other governments
                        that the language thereof should give equitable and legitimate protection to
                        American commercial interests as compared to the interests of third
                        countries. I mentioned that, as Mr. Liu was aware, under our system of
                        government it was necessary for treaties to be approved by the Senate and
                        that it was my impression that the Senate was consistently careful in all
                        such matters to see that legitimate American commercial interests were given
                        adequate protection in our treaties with other countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Liu indicated that he understood the situation clearly and was not
                        unsympathetic with the point of view which I had presented to him.</p>
                    <p>I told Mr. Liu that we would study the Chinese document and furnish a formal
                        reply in due course.</p>
                    <p>The conversation as usual was extremely friendly and cordial.</p>

                            and inland navigation of the Republic of China’ shall be amended to

                                    the Republic of China on the one hand, and the Governments of

                                    treaty applies, pending the making of further arrangements
                                    between them or the conclusion of the comprehensive treaty

                    <p>6230. 1. We received on December 8 the Chinese Government’s reply to our
                        document of November 27. The substance of the Chinese reply is as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>[Here follows substance of Chinese memorandum of December 7, printed on <ref
                            target="#pg_392">page 392</ref>.]</p>
                    <p>2. As regards (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) (1) above, we are inclined to adopt
                        an attitude similar to that of the British Government as expressed in
                        paragraph numbered 2 of Mr. Eden’s letter of December 4 (your 6870, December
                        4, 8 p.m.) and assume that with the abolition of the treaty port system it
                        is not the intention of the Chinese Government to confine foreign overseas
                        shipping to particular ports. We accordingly propose not to make any further
                        counter-suggestion to the Chinese on this point.</p>
                    <p>3. As regards the questions of inland navigation and coasting trade, which
                        questions would seem to constitute the only remaining matter of difference
                        between us and the Chinese, we are prepared to accept an appropriately
                        revised wording of the formula suggested by the Chinese which would be
                        consistent with the provisions of the draft <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397"
                            facs="0407"/>full article on this subject previously proposed as an
                        alternative to reserving the matter for the later comprehensive treaty. We
                        accordingly expect to suggest to the Chinese that the second sentence of the
                        quoted portion of paragraph (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) (2) [<hi
                            rend="italic">3</hi>] above be revised to read as follows: “It is
                        further understood, however, that, if vessels of any third powers are
                        permitted to participate in the coasting trade or inland navigation, vessels
                        of the United States of America shall be allowed the same privileges.”</p>
                    <p>4. With reference to Mr. Eden’s comments in his letter of December 7 (your
                        6931, December 7, 11 p.m.), it is requested that you inform Mr. Eden along
                        lines as follows:</p>
                    <p>Although we have naturally been desirous, for reasons which Mr. Eden will
                        himself of course appreciate and some of which we have referred to in
                        previous telegrams, to expedite so far as possible the conclusion of the
                        brief treaty on extraterritoriality, we have made no concessions to the
                        Chinese merely for the sake of saving time. On the contrary on several
                        occasions action which we had been desirous of taking and which we were
                        after full consideration prepared to take has been postponed by us because
                        of our desire to cooperate to the fullest extent possible with the British
                        Government and in the earnest hope of reducing to a minimum the very few
                        divergencies between our views and those of the British
                        Government—divergencies which have arisen as a very natural result of
                        necessary differences between our respective practices and procedures.</p>
                    <p>As previously mentioned, our concept in proposing the brief treaty has been
                        that it would effect abolition of extraterritorial and other special rights
                        and would take care of such related matters as might require attention
                        because of abolition of extraterritoriality. We had, of course, hoped to
                        avoid extraneous matters and matters of particularization which might cause
                        the negotiations to be unnecessarily prolonged (thereby tending to lessen
                        the psychological benefits which might be expected to accrue from the
                        treaty) and which might more appropriately be reserved for the later
                        comprehensive treaty. From the beginning we have had no thought of seeking
                        to reserve or to obtain from China anything that is not usual and normal in
                        modern international relations between friendly countries and we have, it is
                        believed, made this clear both to the Chinese Government and to the British
                        Government. We have proceeded on the assumption that the Chinese Government
                        has had in mind objectives identical with ours and has desired, as strongly
                        as we have desired, to see the relations between the United States and China
                        placed, through the medium of the brief treaty, on a basis of what is
                        normal, usual, equitable and just in international relations.</p>
                    <p>The concept of the British Government in regard to the question of
                        relinquishment of extraterritorial and related rights has from the outset
                            <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0408"/>of our discussions proved to be
                        substantially the same as ours. As mentioned above, and previously in
                        paragraph numbered three of our 5931, November 25, 7 p.m., such divergence
                        of views as has obtained between this Government and the British Government
                        in regard to such questions as the coasting trade and inland navigation
                        arises from differences in the established practices and procedures of the
                        two Governments.</p>
                    <p>Treatment of commercial subjects by this Government and treatment thereof by
                        the British Government are necessarily affected by considerations and
                        requirements which are not identical. As previously mentioned, we are not in
                        position reciprocally to offer to the Chinese a simple formula suitable for
                        inclusion in the present treaty providing for national treatment in commerce
                        for the reason that in our consideration of such matters we must take into
                        account difficult problems of State and Federal jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we are not in position reciprocally to offer the Chinese rights
                        of coasting trade or inland navigation. Nevertheless, in an endeavor to meet
                        British wishes, we accepted a formula designed among other things to place
                        coasting trade and inland navigation in the category of pending matters.
                        Accordingly we proposed to the Chinnese that these matters be held in
                        abeyance. We proposed as an alternative a formula suggested by the British
                        Government. As a third suggested procedure we proposed the insertion of a
                        full article on inland navigation and coasting trade along the lines of
                        articles written into our modern treaties with other countries. The question
                        of proposing such an article was raised with the British Government as early
                        as October 31 and received comment in Mr. Eden’s letter to you of November
                        12 (your 6401, November 13, midnight) to the effect that if the inclusion of
                        an additional article in the treaty became unavoidable the British
                        Government would be agreeable to accepting one along those general lines. As
                        the Chinese have been insistent in dealing with the coasting trade and
                        inland navigation in the present treaty, we did not see how we could do
                        other than keep such action as might be decided upon within the framework of
                        our policy not to seek special rights. Our inability to offer reciprocal
                        rights necessitated the action which we took and which had received full
                        consideration. In this connection we mentioned in paragraph numbered six of
                        our 5931 that we believed that we had come as closely as is possible within
                        the necessary framework of our concepts, policies, and practices to
                        paralleling the British suggestions.</p>
                    <p>It may be of interest that Dr. Soong has stated categorically to our
                        Ambassador at Chungking that China does not propose to allow foreign flag
                        vessels to participate in coasting and inland waterways trade. If this
                        statement accurately reflects the policy of the Chinese Government <pb
                            n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0409"/>(and our impression of the trend of
                        Chinese official and public opinion and feeling of recent times is that it
                        does), we, for our part, consider that we cannot do other than to recognize
                        that China, accorded an equal and sovereign place in the family of nations,
                        will be completely within her rights in reserving inland navigation and
                        coasting trade to the Chinese flag.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly our decisions with respect to the points raised by Mr. Eden
                        involve, in our view, not the making of “concessions” to the Chinese but the
                        effecting of the relinquishment of our special and unilateral rights with no
                        limitation other than the usual and normal limitation, which is a cardinal
                        tenet of our general commercial policy, that our interests shall not be
                        discriminated against as compared with the interests of third countries.</p>
                    <p>It had been our hope to have the treaty signed about December 8 or 9; signing
                        must now, of course, await final action in regard to the questions of inland
                        navigation and coasting trade.</p>

                    <p>1471. For the Secretary and Under Secretary. Your 1193, December 6, 2 p.m.
                        Foreign Minister received me this morning in presence of his legal advisers
                        who do not find our proposed article on shipping acceptable in its present
                        form. Briefly, it is contended that, while in the first paragraph of the
                        article, we relinquish our special rights, the last sentence of the second
                        paragraph might be construed by some as implying that some right[s] of
                        coasting and inland trade continue to exist. Foreign Minister reiterated
                        firm intention of China to insist on relinquishment of these rights by all
                        treaty powers, commenting that if necessary China will unilaterally denounce
                        such treaty provisions still existing.</p>
                    <p>Following redraft of proposed article was submitted for transmission to
                        Department: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The Government of the United States of America and the Government of

                                and waters of the other country which are or may be opened to
                                overseas merchant shipping, and that the treatment accorded to such
                                vessels in such ports, places and waters shall be no less favorable
                                than that accorded to national vessels and shall be as favorable as

                                inland navigation or coasting trade to vessels of any third country
                                such rights would similarly be accorded to the vessels of the other

                                are excepted from the requirement of national treatment and are to
                                be regulated according to the laws of each country in relation
                                thereto. It is agreed however that vessels of either country shall
                                enjoy within the territory of the other country with respect to the
                                coasting trade and inland navigation treatment as favorable as that
                                accorded to the vessels of any third country.”</p>

                    <p>1. For your confidential information, we are informing the British that we
                        are inclined to accept the Chinese suggestion for a revision of the proposed
                        article on inland navigation and coasting trade but that we now prefer to
                        cover this as well as other matters relating to shipping in the exchange of
                        notes, our reason for preference being that the Chinese suggestion contains
                        language which does not seem from the technical drafting point of view to
                        fall appropriately within the framework of the formal article on these
                        subjects which we usually have in our treaties with other countries.</p>

                        relating to treaty ports, special courts and foreign pilots and to precede

                    <p>6327. Department’s 6230, December 9, 8 p.m.</p>
                    <p>1. We have now received from the Chinese another suggestion in regard to
                        questions of inland navigation and coasting trade, namely, that the
                        sentences of our draft article on those subjects be rearranged as indicated
                        below and that there be inserted an additional sentence reading as follows:
                        “Should either country later accord the right of inland navigation or
                        coasting trade to vessels of any third country such rights would similarly
                        be accorded to the vessels of the other country.”</p>
                    <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0412"/>
                    <p>As the last sentence of our draft is retained, our rights would seem to be
                        given adequate protection and we accordingly are inclined to accept this
                        suggestion and not put forth the proposal we were considering as mentioned
                        in paragraph numbered 3 of our telegram under reference. We would prefer,
                        and propose so informing the Chinese, that these matters now be covered in
                        the exchange of notes rather than in an additional article to the treaty,
                        our reason for such preference being that the Chinese suggestion contains
                        language which from the technical drafting point of view does not seem to
                        fall appropriately within the framework of the formal article on these
                        subjects which we usually have in our treaties with other countries.</p>
                    <p>The appropriate portion of the exchange of notes (to follow the provisions
                        relating to treaty ports, special courts and foreign pilots and to precede
                        the paragraph relating to naval vessels) would accordingly read as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>[Here follows text quoted in telegram No. 1225, December 14, 8 p.m., to the
                        Ambassador in China, printed <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi>]</p>
                    <p>2. Dr. Soong has informed Ambassador Gauss at Chungking that, in addition to
                        the above, the Chinese Government would be prepared to agree to an exchange
                        of notes to the following effect: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The Chinese Government declares that it is its firm intention to
                                limit inland navigation and coasting trade to vessels of (the)
                                Chinese flag, and assures the Government of the United States that
                                under no circumstances will American interests be discriminated
                                against vis-à-vis any third country.”</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>We do not consider that this suggested additional exchange is required for
                        our purposes and propose so to inform the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>3. If the British Foreign Office has any further comment in regard to these
                        matters we should appreciate receiving it if possible at once. We are of
                        course desirous of informing the Chinese without delay of our agreement to
                        the suggested redraft of the provisions relating to coasting trade and
                        inland navigation as indicated in paragraph numbered 1 above and of
                        proceeding to arrange a definite date in the very near future for the
                        signing of the treaty.</p>

                    <p>7090. Mr. Eden wrote me on December 14 with respect to the penultimate
                        paragraph of the memorandum transmitted in my 6608, November 24, 2 p.m.,
                        mentioning that the Chinese Government had <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403"
                            facs="0413"/>asked for the inclusion in article 5 of the Sino-British
                        treaty an additional clause terminating the convention for the extension of
                        Hong Kong territory signed at Peiping in 1898. Mr. Eden now states that the
                        British Government is not prepared to consider this matter in connection
                        with the present treaty, since not only has the area leased by the
                        convention nothing to do with extraterritoriality, but being, as stated in
                        the agreement, an enlargement of British territory, is in an entirely
                        different category from the concessions and settlements in China in which
                        the British are relinquishing their special rights. The British Ambassador
                        at Chungking has therefore been instructed to inform the Chinese Government
                        that the British Government regards the leased territory as outside the
                        scope of the present treaty.</p>

                    <p>7137. I have just received the following letter dated December 14 from Mr.
                        Eden: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“I am grateful to you for the details of the latest developments in
                                the negotiations concerning extraterritoriality contained in your
                                letter of the 11th December (Department’s 6230, December 9, 8 p.m.).
                                I also much appreciate the full and sympathetic reply contained in
                                paragraph 4 of the Department’s message to the points which I had
                                raised in my letter to you of the 7th December (my 6931, December 7,
                                11 p.m.).</p>
                            <p>We readily agree that such divergencies as there are between our
                                respective approaches to this problem arise from a difference in
                                practice obtaining in our respective territories and more especially
                                the extent to which we are able to grant to the Chinese reciprocity
                                in certain matters.</p>
                            <p>No reply has yet been received by us from the Chinese Government
                                corresponding with that communicated to the Department of State on
                                the 8th December. But as regards certain of the specific points
                                mentioned in the message from the Department of State our position
                                is as follows: <list>
                                    <item>One. (A) (2) We note that the Chinese Government withdraws
                                        its proposal that an addition be made at the end of the
                                        second paragraph of articles II and III of the American
                                        draft. Read in conjunction with the second point in the
                                        United States communication to the Chinese Embassy of the
                                        27th November, we assume this to mean the <pb n="404"
                                            xml:id="pg_404" facs="0414"/>phrase ‘and for the
                                        recognition and protection of all legitimate rights therein’
                                        will be retained in the text and I have so instructed His
                                        Majesty’s Ambassador at Chungking.</item>
                                    <item>Two. We note that the United States Government accept the
                                        Chinese wording for the paragraph in the exchange of notes
                                        dealing with ports open to overseas merchant shipping. For
                                        our part we await the views of the Chinese Government on the
                                        wording already communicated to you (paragraph 1 (<hi
                                            rend="italic">a</hi>) of the annex to our draft exchange
                                        of notes). As regards the Chinese wording we would observe
                                        that the use of the expression ‘coastal ports’ appears to
                                        exclude overseas merchant shipping from the river ports
                                        which have hitherto been open to overseas merchant
                                        shipping.</item>
                                    <item>Three. As regards coastal trade and inland navigation, we
                                        await the views of the Chinese Government on the wording of
                                        our draft exchange of notes as modified in the manner
                                        communicated to you in my letter of December 8th (my 6970,
                                        December 9, 6 p.m.).</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>I note that the only outstanding matter of discussion in the American
                                draft treaty is the question of coastal trade and inland navigation.
                                Pending the receipt of the Chinese Government’s reply to our latest
                                proposals it is impossible for us to foresee when our own treaty
                                will be concluded, but I shall, of course, inform you as soon as the
                                Chinese reply is received.”</p>

                                        such vessels in such ports, places and waters shall be no

                                        party means all vessels registered under the law of any of

                                    <p>His Majesty the King relinquishes the special rights which

                                        China. The President of the Republic of China relinquishes
                                        the special rights which have been accorded to Chinese
                                        vessels in respect of navigation on the river Irrawaddy
                                        under article 12 of the convention signed at London on the
                                        1st March 1894. Should one high contracting party accord in
                                        any of his territories the right of coasting trade or inland
                                        navigation to vessels of any third country, such rights
                                        would similarly be accorded to vessels of the other high
                                        contracting party provided that the latter high contracting
                                        party permits vessels of the former high contracting party
                                        to engage in the coasting trade or inland navigation of his
                                        territories. Coasting trade and inland navigation are
                                        excepted from the requirement of national treatment and are
                                        to be regulated according to the laws of each high
                                        contracting party in relation thereto. It is agreed,
                                        however, that vessels of either high contracting party shall
                                        enjoy within the territories of the other high contracting
                                        party with respect to coasting trade and inland navigation
                                        treatment as favorable as that accorded to vessels of any

                            <p>The Foreign Office note that the Department of State intend to accept
                                the wording now proposed by the Chinese Government and that there is
                                no reference to the taking over of any American properties that may
                                have been engaged for the purposes of coastal trade and inland
                                navigation and the payment of adequate compensation therefor. The
                                Foreign Office are also inclined not to raise this latter point now
                                but to assume that the reservation of coastal trade and inland
                                navigation to ships flying the Chinese flag does not necessarily
                                preclude the use of foreign-owned wharves, et cetera, for the
                                purposes of these trades.</p>
                            <p>In connection with the understanding on coastal trade and inland
                                navigation, His Majesty’s Ambassador will inform the Chinese
                                Government of the long established practice under which trade
                                between India, on the one hand, and Burma or Ceylon, on the other,
                                is regarded as coastal trade.”</p>

                    <p>Reference is made to the Chinese Embassy’s memorandum of December 7, 1942, in
                        regard to the draft treaty on extraterritoriality.</p>
                    <p>One. The Government of the United States concurs in the suggestion of the
                        Chinese Government in paragraph B 1 of the Chinese Embassy’s memorandum
                        under reference in regard to the question of the abolition of treaty ports
                        as such.</p>
                    <p>Two. With regard to the questions of inland navigation and coasting trade,
                        the suggestion made in paragraph B 3 of the Chinese Embassy’s memorandum of
                        December 7 would appear to have been superseded in part by the suggestion
                        received by the Department of State from the Chinese Embassy on December
                        12.</p>
                    <p>As the Chinese Government is aware, it has been the concept of this
                        Government that questions such as those of inland navigation and coasting
                        trade might more appropriately be covered in the later comprehensive treaty.
                        Nevertheless, the Government of the United States, in the belief that the
                        objectives of the two Governments have been identical, has endeavored to
                        give sympathetic understanding to the wishes of the Chinese Government in
                        regard to these as well as to other matters in connection with the treaty
                        and, in receiving the Chinese suggestion of December 12, appreciates the
                        efforts of the Chinese Government similarly to meet the wishes of the
                        Government of the United States.</p>
                    <p>After giving study to the suggestion received from the Chinese Embassy on
                        December 12, it is believed that, although the revision suggested does not
                        fall within the precise framework of the formal articles on these subjects
                        which this Government prefers to have in its modern treaties with other
                        countries, the language meets the requirements of this Government in regard
                        to protection of legitimate American commercial interests as compared with
                        the commercial interests of third countries. Accordingly, the Government of
                        the United States is agreeable to including the suggested revision in the
                        supplemental exchange of notes rather than in the body of the treaty, and
                        assumes that the Chinese Government will also be agreeable to this
                        procedure. (The Chinese Foreign Minister has suggested to the American
                        Ambassador at Chungking that the revision under discussion might be
                        supplemented by a second exchange of notes giving additional assurances in
                        regard to the treatment to be accorded to American shipping as compared with
                        third country shipping. As, however, the question of the treatment of
                        American interests is, as stated above, adequately covered by the revised
                        language, adoption of Dr. Soong’s kind suggestion would not seem to be
                        necessary.)</p>

                    <p>Three. It is believed that the Government of the United States and the
                        Chinese Government have now reached complete agreement in regard to the
                        draft treaty and the supplemental exchange of notes. This Government
                        therefore proposes to proceed with the preparation of the treaty and notes
                        in form for signature and suggests that, if the Chinese Government is
                        agreeable, the treaty and notes be signed in the office of the Secretary of
                        State on January 1, 1943.</p>
                    <p>Four. A final draft of the treaty and supplemental exchange of notes,
                        conformable to the understanding of the Government of the United States, is
                            appended.<note n="24" xml:id="d306fn24">Not printed.</note> It will be
                        observed that the substantive part of the draft note from the Chinese
                        Government to the Government of the United States concludes with a new
                        paragraph as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“It is understood that these agreements and understandings if
                                confirmed by your Excellency’s Government shall be considered as
                                forming an integral part of the treaty signed today and shall be
                                considered as effective upon the date of the entrance into force of
                                that treaty.”</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">It is assumed that the Chinese Government will be entirely
                        agreeable to the addition of this paragraph to the note.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Liu called at our request at eleven o’clock to receive our memorandum of
                        December 18<note n="25" xml:id="d307fn25">

                        </note> in reply to the Chinese Embassy’s memorandum of December 7
                        supplemented by the Chinese suggestion in regard to inland navigation and
                        coasting trade of December 12.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Liu stated that a telegram had just been received from the Chinese
                        Foreign Office to the effect that the word “later” might be omitted from the
                        second sentence of the paragraph in the exchange of notes in regard to
                        inland navigation and coasting trade (page 2 of the draft of December
                            18<note n="26" xml:id="d307fn26">Draft not printed.</note>) and we
                        accordingly marked it out of the draft attached to our memorandum of
                        December 18. (It had been noted that the word “later” had been omitted also,
                        apparently with <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0419"/>Chinese assent,
                        from the British draft as indicated in London’s 7195, December 18, 7
                        p.m.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Liu read over our memorandum of December 18 and, with reference to the
                        last two sentences in parenthesis on page 3, stated that we were very
                        generous in saying that adoption of Dr. Soong’s additional suggestion would
                        not be necessary.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Liu stated that another telegram had been received from the Chinese
                        Foreign Office to the effect that the Chinese Government desired that the
                        treaty be in both the English and the Chinese languages and that both texts
                        be considered authoritative. He mentioned that the proposed British treaty
                        would be executed in the two languages. Some general discussion of this
                        question ensued. Mr. Hornbeck stated that we would not, of course, wish to
                        object to this Chinese suggestion but pointed out a number of practical
                        reasons why it might be advisable for the English text to be the authentic
                        text, including the reason that English is a more precise language than
                        Chinese and the reason that so few Americans and other foreigners have a
                        competent knowledge of the Chinese language as compared with the number of
                        the Chinese officials and others who have a competent knowledge of the
                        English language. Mr. Hornbeck went on to say also that otherwise it might
                        be advisable to have a third text in French and that the use of such third
                        language would have practical value to both the Chinese and to us,
                        especially as the officials of other countries contemplating treaties on
                        extraterritoriality with China are undoubtedly familiar with French and
                        there would accordingly spread throughout the world a clearer understanding
                        of the action we are taking. As regards the question of precision of
                        language, Mr. Liu stated that in recent years Chinese treaty language had
                        become very precise indeed and there was little danger of ambiguity. Mr.
                        Hornbeck remarked that, as the treaty in question was one of relinquishment
                        rather than of establishment, the question of precision was perhaps in this
                        instance not so important. The question whether a third language would be
                        used was left undetermined for the time being.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hornbeck left to rejoin a meeting in the Secretary’s office and Mr. Liu
                        and I discussed several aspects of the draft treaty and notes and the
                        question of signing.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out to Mr. Liu that, in accordance with the Chinese offer of
                        December 7, we had in our draft attached to our memorandum of December 18
                        retained the clause ending the first sentence of the paragraph in the notes
                        in regard to inland navigation and coasting trade, “and that the Government
                        of the Republic of China is prepared to take over any American properties
                        that may have been engaged for those purposes and to pay adequate
                        compensation therefor”. I mentioned that this clause had been omitted from
                        the Chinese suggestion <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0420"/>of December
                        12 but, as it had been offered in the Chinese memorandum of December 7, we
                        had assumed that the omission in the December 12 suggestion was inadvertent
                        and had therefore included it in our “final” draft. Mr. Liu indicated that
                        there would be no objection to this.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Liu asked whether we desired that the treaty be signed in Washington and
                        mentioned that Dr. T. V. Soong, the Chinese Foreign Minister, was now in
                        Chungking. I said that it had been our assumption all along that the treaty
                        would be signed here, especially as the negotiations had been conducted in
                        Washington. I added that the matter of the relinquishment of our
                        extraterritorial rights was one in which the Secretary had had personal
                        interest, the treaty exemplified action he had long wished to take and I
                        felt sure that Mr. Hull would naturally wish to sign the treaty. I mentioned
                        that Dr. Soong would sign the British treaty in Chungking and probably some
                        of the other forthcoming treaties on extraterritoriality. Mr. Liu stated
                        that he understood our point of view and much appreciated the Secretary’s
                        interest in the matter.</p>
                    <p>I explained to Mr. Liu that the engrossing of the treaty would take several
                        days and that one typographical error would require the whole process of
                        engrossing to be repeated. I said that it would accordingly be helpful if we
                        could have the Chinese reply as soon as possible. Mr. Liu stated that he did
                        not think it would take long to get a telegraphic reply from Chungking and
                        that he was sure that the matter would not be delayed. He said that the
                        Chinese Embassy would prepare a Chinese text of the treaty and let us have
                        it within a few days. After the usual exchange of amenities, during which
                        Mr. Liu made repeated expressions of the Chinese appreciation of our
                        efforts, he departed.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Liu Chieh telephoned me at noon and stated that a telegram had been
                        received from the Chinese Foreign Office in which the Foreign Office
                        requested that we revert to the preamble which we had suggested in the
                        original draft of the treaty handed to the Chinese on October 24. He stated
                        that he would come to the Department to discuss the matter with me. Before
                        his arrival I consulted with Mr. Hornbeck and it was decided that I should
                        hand to Mr. Liu a counter-suggestion drafted by Mr. Hornbeck, copy attached,
                        as a basis for discussion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Liu arrived at 1:00 p.m. He said he felt most apologetic in the matter;
                        he realized that our “final” suggestion in regard to the preamble had been
                        formally accepted by the Chinese in the Chinese Embassy’s memorandum of
                        December 7 and that also Dr. T. V. Soong, the Chinese Foreign Minister, had
                        informed the American Ambassador at Chungking that the suggestion in
                        question was acceptable to the Chinese; he hoped nevertheless that as we had
                        in the first <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0423"/>place offered the
                        draft preamble which the Chinese now desired to adopt there would be no
                        objection to adopting that preamble.</p>
                    <p>I said to Mr. Liu that when our original draft treaty had been presented to
                        the Chinese it constituted a comparatively simple document providing for the
                        relinquishment of extraterritorial and other special rights and for the
                        taking care of immediately related matters which required attention. I said
                        that we had hoped to avoid including in the treaty extraneous matters but
                        that a number of them had been brought in and that the “final” draft
                        presented to the Chinese on December 19 covered, at the instance of the
                        Chinese, a number of questions not originally envisaged as part of the
                        treaty: coasting trade and inland navigation, visits of merchant vessels,
                        foreign pilots, visits of naval vessels, et cetera. I added that we had
                        striven very hard to meet Chinese wishes in every appropriate way; that, as
                        the treaty had been considerably broadened and was now actually a quite
                        comprehensive document, we felt that the preamble should be broad enough to
                        include some of the thoughts we had in mind when we presented our draft of
                        November 27, which, as he had mentioned, had been formally accepted by the
                        Chinese Government, and which exemplified an earnest endeavor to meet the
                        wishes of the Chinese Government in regard to the preamble.</p>
                    <p>I said that I could not at this moment make a definitive counter-suggestion
                        in regard to the preamble but I could offer him informally a tentative draft
                        to serve as a basis of discussion, and I thereupon handed him the text of
                        the draft attached. Mr. Liu stated that he was afraid that reference of this
                        counter-suggestion to the Foreign Office at Chungking would, as the time was
                        so short, cause delay in the signing of the treaty. I said that I thought
                        that it was quite possible that the desire at the last moment of the Chinese
                        to abandon the agreed upon preamble might have that result.</p>
                    <p>We discussed various phases of the matter, Mr. Liu handed me a revised and
                        “confirmed” Chinese text of the treaty, and after the usual amenities he
                        departed. Our conversation was friendly and cordial throughout.</p>

                    <p>7405. I have just received the following letter from Mr. Eden dated December

                                    (793.003/1048).</note>) a memorandum on the latest position in
                                our negotiations on extraterritoriality in China. From this you will
                                see that in order to reach early agreement and to be in a position
                                to sign our treaty on the same day as the United States Government
                                sign theirs we have conceded the Chinese requirements on every
                                outstanding point but one, including certain points, such as
                                national treatment for commerce, in respect of which we attach
                                importance to obtaining what was no more than reciprocal treatment
                                so far as we were concerned. Our desire has been throughout to align
                                ourselves with the United States as closely as our differing
                                positions allowed and to make of the signing of our treaties an
                                Anglo-American-Chinese act of political solidarity.</p>
                            <p>Only one point remains to be settled and this, although not of our
                                raising, is of essential importance to us. In reply to the Chinese
                                Government’s proposal for the rendition of the ‘new territories’ at
                                Kowloon we have, as you will see, offered a formula whereby we
                                indicate that in our view this is a matter, if the Chinese
                                Government wish to raise it, for discussion when victory has been
                                won. We are unable to admit that this question falls under the head
                                of the abrogation of extraterritoriality and we are unable to
                                withdraw from the position which we have taken up. To do so would be
                                to lay ourselves open to further Chinese pressure on other matters
                                the extent of which cannot be foretold.</p>
                            <p>If as a result of this we are unable to reach the agreement with the
                                Chinese Government on a treaty abolishing extraterritoriality <pb
                                    n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0425"/>it will obviously be highly
                                regrettable. But we have faced this eventuality in taking our
                                decision which is final.</p>
                            <p>The United States Government have during these negotiations shown a
                                willingness to collaborate with us which we value highly. On our
                                side we have done what we could to reduce to a minimum the
                                requirements which the extent of our interests justified and have at
                                all times endeavoured to suit our action to that of the United
                                States Government. The question of the new territories was not,
                                however, foreseen at the outset of our joint approach to the Chinese
                                Government. It is not yet certain that the latter intend to press
                                this issue to the point of a deadlock, but I should be glad if you
                                would inform your government urgently of the position. We should be
                                grateful if they felt able to use their influence with the Chinese
                                Government to prevent this occurring.”</p>

                                regard to the Chinese text of our treaty. We would assume that there
                                are some similar points in regard to the Chinese text of the British
                                treaty. We are wondering what may be the thought of the British
                                Government and of the Chinese Government on the subject of having,
                                where there is identity of language in the British and the American
                                treaties, similar identity of language in the Chinese texts. We
                                shall take this up with the Chinese today (December 31). The
                                adjustments which we find necessary cannot be completed and the
                                engrossing of the English and the Chinese texts be completed in time
                                for signature on January 1. We therefore suggest that date for
                                signature be not set until all details of translation, agreement on
                                texts and engrossing are completed and all parties are fully ready
                                to sign. Dates or hours for signatures could then quickly be decided
                                upon without likelihood of hitch. We feel that it would be desirable
                                to have the British and the American treaties signed at
                                approximately the same hour.”</p>

                    <p>We took up this matter with the Chinese Minister Counselor on December 31.
                        The Minister Counselor stated that the Chinese Embassy would immediately
                        communicate to the Chinese Foreign Office by telegraph a suggestion that the
                        Chinese texts of the Sino-American and Sino-British treaties be identical
                        where identity of language occurs in the English texts.</p>

                    <p>1577. Soong this afternoon informed Vincent<note n="33" xml:id="d313fn33"
                            >John Carter Vincent, Counselor of Embassy in China.</note> that matter
                        of preamble of new treaty had been settled and that with regard to a
                        difference of opinion respecting Chinese translation of certain phrases, he
                        had authorized Ambassador Wei to accept our translation (although he
                        continued in the belief that the translation made here was preferable) in
                        order that the treaty might be signed tomorrow. Soong stated that the
                        British-Indian treaty would be signed tomorrow at noon by himself for China
                        and by the British Ambassador and the acting agent of the Indian Government
                        respectively. Texts of the treaty will not be released until midnight after
                        signing. Soong stated confidently that our treaty would be signed tomorrow
                        in Washington and expressed concern that requested summary of treaty for
                        simultaneous release here with the British treaty had not yet arrived and
                        said that Generalissimo would probably make a brief summary statement on
                        treaty if summary is not received tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>British Ambassador confirmed to Vincent Soong’s statement regarding plans for
                        signing treaty here tomorrow [and] said that his most recent telegram
                        (December 30) instructed him that, although matter of preamble in our treaty
                        had been settled, questions regarding Chinese translation had not and that
                        American treaty would probably not be signed until January 4th or 5th. He
                        said that his instructions were not to sign before the day on which the
                        American treaty was definitely to be signed and that therefore, although he
                        was allowing plans for signing tomorrow to proceed, he would not sign unless
                        he had confirmation that the American treaty was also to be signed
                        tomorrow.</p>

                        and in regard to certain matters of personal status.</p>
                    <p>As indicated in paragraph 6 of our 5200, October 21, 10 p.m., we have been
                        prepared to suggest to the Chinese Government informally that the Chinese
                        Government might care, of its own accord and as a unilateral act on its
                        part, and in whatever way it wishes, to take whatever steps it might
                        consider appropriate to give assurances with regard to the courts and
                        prisons in which foreign nationals in China might be tried or detained. We
                        consider that it would be helpful for us to make such an approach and we
                        shall expect, upon the signing of the treaty and supplemental exchange of
                        notes, to hand to the Chinese Embassy a document marked “Oral” reading as
                            follows:<note n="35" xml:id="d314fn35">“Oral” statement was handed on
                            January 11, 1943, to the Minister Counselor of the Chinese Embassy by

                            <p>“This Government has been following in recent years the progressive
                                steps which the Chinese Government has taken in matters relating to
                                the administration of justice. This Government has noted the spirit
                                which the Chinese Government has shown in adopting new civil and
                                criminal codes, in establishing modern courts of justice, and in
                                building improved prisons.</p>
                            <p>It is believed that it is the intention of the Chinese Government
                                that this progressive program shall be extended throughout the
                                territory of the Republic of China and that as areas of Chinese
                                territory now under Japanese military control are restored to
                                Chinese jurisdiction modern courts of justice will be reestablished
                                and modern prisons will be restored or be built in such areas.</p>
                            <p>Questions affecting the administration of justice are regarded by the
                                people of this country—as by the people of China—as of the very
                                highest importance. It is to be expected that in connection with the
                                relinquishment of extraterritorial jurisdiction by the American
                                authorities over American nationals in China the people of this
                                country will wish to understand as fully as possible just what the
                                situation of American nationals in China is to be in respect to
                                these questions. Undoubtedly, peoples in other countries concerned
                                will be desirous of similar information.</p>
                            <p>It has been this Government’s understanding from indications given by
                                the Chinese Government on occasion in the past that it is the policy
                                of the Chinese Government that, except in the case of police
                                offenses, foreign nationals who are parties to civil or criminal
                                cases shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the modern Chinese
                                courts of justice only; that in the case of police offenses foreign
                                nationals shall be tried either by the modern Chinese courts of
                                justice or by the police tribunals acting in accordance with duly
                                promulgated laws, ordinances, and regulations; and that foreign
                                nationals who may be detained or arrested or imprisoned by the
                                Chinese authorities shall be held only in prisons designated by the
                                Ministry of Justice for the detention of foreign nationals or in
                                other suitable places.</p>
                            <p>If the Chinese Government should of its own initiative, by any
                                measures that it might consider appropriate, set forth its policy
                                with regard to these matters, such a step would be warmly welcomed

                        </p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) I have felt for some time prior to the
                            outbreak of war that in view of the extreme gravity of the internal
                            economic situation here a new loan to China was needed. This feeling has
                            been reinforced since December 8 in view of the effect on Chinese
                            political opinion of the initial Japanese successes, of the probable
                            effect of temporary Japanese successes in southeast Asia in the near
                            future, and of the perceptible strengthening of defeatist elements in
                            Chinese Government circles. In this situation a substantial loan to
                            China, the bigger the better, would be invaluable in keeping China going
                            as an anti-Axis power. The very fact that the larger portion of such a
                            loan could not be used is an argument in favor of making it as big as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) While the internal economic effects of such a
                            loan, after the initial psychological effects have worn off, might not
                            be commensurate <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0430"/>with its size,
                            owing to the physical difficulties in the way of importing goods, they
                            would nevertheless be beneficial. But, more important, the political
                            advantages would be very great. A loan might make all the difference
                            between a victory of the Chinese defeatist[s] (and they are lukewarm)
                            and their neutralization. As already indicated, the actual outlay would
                            be much smaller than the nominal amount of the loan. Its political
                            effects would be reinforced if no specific guarantees were required. It
                            would be desirable to have the loan used as an occasion for insisting on
                            the improvement and strengthening of the Central Bank and banking system
                            of China.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) The loan could be used: (1) to guarantee the
                            issue of attractive government bonds to absorb <hi rend="italic"
                                >fapi</hi> and make it unnecessary henceforth for the Chinese
                            Government to issue more notes to cover its budgetary deficit, thus
                            retarding the inflationary spiral; (2) to promote trade with India as
                            long as the Burma Road remains open and with Russia and thus ensure the
                            maintenance of an inflow of goods from abroad. The political aspects of
                            financing trade with Russia I am in no position to evaluate but economic
                            advantages would certainly accrue; (3) if possible to finance loans to
                            promote internal small scale production, for which there is a crying
                            need, and agricultural production. (Both (2) and (3) would help retard
                            the rise in prices by increasing the supply of goods.) And possibly (4)
                            to provide a backing in foreign exchange for the note issue which would
                            have temporarily beneficial effects on internal confidence in <hi
                                rend="italic">fapi</hi>. It might be desirable to tie up the
                            Stabilization Board with the loan in one way or another, if only because
                            the Board might more easily secure confidence than could the Chinese
                            Government itself.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) [<hi rend="italic">e</hi>] A scheme has been
                            submitted to the Board by the Ministry of Finance proposing that its
                            remaining United States dollar and sterling assets be used as a
                            guarantee fund for the issue of Chinese Government bonds on the lines of
                                (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) 1 above. There are three objections:
                            first, that the amount involved would not suffice to contribute
                            appreciably in the absorption of granting insurance; secondly, there is
                            some doubt as to the legality of such a procedure under the terms of
                            agreements instituting the fund; and thirdly, it would deprive the Board
                            of its function of providing foreign exchange for imports and as long as
                            imports are possible this function must be performed.</p>
                        <p>2. The above except for a few modifications was prepared on December 31
                            immediately upon my return from Kunming. Yesterday morning Ambassador
                            Gauss kindly brought me up to date with respect to the steps taken thus

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: You will of course be
                            aware that the question of further American and British assistance to
                            China has been raised in the last few days and that in particular Chiang
                            Kai-shek has suggested to the two Ambassadors that China ought to
                            receive additional loan assistance to a total of $500 millions and £100
                            millions.</p>
                        <p>The British Government would be very interested to know what are your
                            general reactions to this proposal. The sums mentioned are of course,
                            enormous and it is the reverse of obvious how far large dollar and
                            sterling credits could enable China to face her real problem, which is
                            to check the enormous inflation of Chinese currency resulting from the
                            war. It appears that the Chinese Budget is being met 90 percent or more
                            by note printing. Nothing is being done to meet the situation by the
                            borrowing of genuine savings, but in order to restrain a still greater
                            rise in prices than has at present occurred it seems essential to make a
                            decided effort in this direction. Prices have already risen over July
                            1937 by anything up to thirty times, mostly since June 1940 and the
                            momentum is growing.</p>
                        <p>Sir Otto Niemeyer is pressing on the Chinese Government certain obviously
                            needed reforms such as controlling the grant of credit by private banks
                            and rates of interest, and measures to make more effective transport
                            control, particularly on the Burma Road, and to check rice prices. We
                            hope that it may be found possible for the U. S. Ambassador to give
                            support to these ideas, which however by themselves are clearly
                            inadequate.</p>
                        <p>I am not aware how far it would be possible for you to give further
                            financial assistance through channels already established but as a
                            practical matter the problem seems to be not to give China more foreign
                            exchange (need for foreign exchange must have been greatly <pb n="422"
                                xml:id="pg_422" facs="0432"/>reduced by the closing of Shanghai and
                            Hong Kong, reducing Chinese imports to what she can get over the Burma
                            Road, and most of the latter is covered by lend-lease) but to check the
                            enormous increase in the internal circulation of bank notes. To deal
                            with this latter point Niemeyer proposes that the Chinese Government
                            should be urged to issue an internal gold loan for say fifteen years
                            secured on customs receipts after existing loans, repayments to start
                            five years hence, and principal but not interest to be guaranteed as to
                            one <hi rend="italic">tranche</hi> by the United States, and as to the
                            other by the United Kingdom, amount not exceeding say £10 millions ($40
                            millions) for each <hi rend="italic">tranche</hi>. The proceeds of this
                            loan would be used to redeem local currency and reduce the circulation.
                            I mentioned this proposal recently to Dr. White,<note n="9"
                                xml:id="d316fn9">Harry Dexter White, Assistant to the Secretary of

                        <p>19. TF–11. From Fox for the Secretary of the Treasury. Sir Otto Niemeyer
                            and Hall-Patch<note n="10" xml:id="d317fn10">Edmund L. Hall-Patch,
                                Financial Attaché of the British Embassy in China and British member
                                of the Chinese Stabilization Board.</note> called yesterday to
                            discuss loan to China. Niemeyer seems to realize: (1) that political
                            situation is bad and that economic and financial considerations are
                            secondary; (2) that loan to China is desirable, the only question being
                            the size of the loan.</p>
                        <p>Niemeyer does not believe any goods can get into China and that China’s
                            request for a loan will be turned down. I think this would be an
                            unfortunate mistake. I believe that it is more important as far as Great
                            Britain is concerned to offer to supply goods such as cotton and cotton
                            yarn from India and Burma and from India steel if it can be, et cetera,

                            received for delivery to Generalissimo a message along the lines of your

                        <p>A meeting was held at the Treasury yesterday regarding the request of the
                            Chinese Government for a loan of five hundred million dollars.</p>
                        <p>The Treasury people said that this loan could be justified only in the
                            event that a political and military result would be had out of it.
                            Plainly, the loan probably would not be repaid. The Treasury was
                            prepared to go into the matter promptly if the Secretary of State would
                            write a letter saying that for political reasons it was deemed desirable
                            to make such a loan.</p>
                        <p>I said that the Secretary had recommended a loan of up to three hundred
                            million dollars, more than a month ago, and that he was still of the
                            same opinion. Our political people seem to believe that the political
                            and military results arising from such a loan justified it. Naturally,
                            if anything could be done to strengthen the economic structure along
                            with the loan, that was so much clear gain.</p>
                        <p>The question was left over for further discussion whether the loan should
                            be an Anglo-American loan or a straight American loan. Mr. Lauchlin
                            Currie vigorously opposed British participation, saying that we were in
                            a better position to do the job. A communication from Sir Frederick
                            Phillips indicates that the British are thinking of small amounts—say,
                            eighty million dollars—and the general opinion was that any small amount
                            like this would probably not cover the situation.</p>

                            Kai-shek’s request for financial assistance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. White asked for an expression on the political factors. Mr. Berle
                            said that everybody concerned with the matter in the State Department
                            felt that it was very important to strengthen Chinese morale by giving
                            large financial assistance at the present time. Mr. Currie expressed
                            concurrence with this view.</p>
                        <p>Mr. White said that it was evident that a small loan would not have
                            significantly useful economic and political effects. On the other hand
                            the Chinese currency is at a stage where depreciation may rapidly
                            accelerate during the next year with crippling effects on China’s
                            ability to finance its military efforts. A loan large enough to check
                            the inflation might have very helpful effects.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that there is no need to await British action on the
                            similar proposal made to them by Chiang. The British relation to the
                            matter could be determined later.</p>
                        <p>During the discussion Mr. White said that an operation of the
                            contemplated kind could properly be described as a stabilization
                            operation but Mr. Morgenthau might not wish to devote so large a part of
                            the Stabilization Fund to China without obtaining Congressional
                            authorization. It was suggested also that thought should be given to
                            amending the Lend-Lease Act<note n="19" xml:id="d319fn19">Approved March
                                11, 1941; 55 Stat. 31.</note> to include financial aid of this kind
                            when Congress next considers it in a month or so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. White requested as a basis for Treasury action a letter from the
                            Secretary of State, or possibly from the President, informing the <pb
                                n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0435"/>Secretary of the Treasury that

                            political and military reasons. With a letter of this kind, the Treasury
                            could proceed to study the numerous practical and technical questions
                            which the arrangements will involve. In the meantime the Treasury will
                            tell Mr. T. V. Soong, the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs, who has
                            been inquiring about the matter, that it is receiving intensive
                                consideration.<note n="20" xml:id="d319fn20">Notation by Mr.

                                Finance.</note> in regard to the financial situation in China.</p>
                        <p>I suggested in my telegram no. 549 of December 31, 5 p.m., that the
                            Congress might be asked to authorize a credit to China up to a specified
                            amount for utilization under agreements or arrangements to be made by
                            the executive branch of the Government after the presentation and
                            consideration of definite proposals to be put forward by the Chinese
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>I am convinced that credits of the magnitude requested by General Chiang
                            (a total of about one billion U. S. dollars) are out of all proportion
                            to the needs of the situation viewed from the political-psychological
                                <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0436"/>or the finance-economic
                            standpoint—or both. While, in the absence of any definite proposals
                            supported by factual data, only a rough estimate can be made, I feel
                            that credits (American and British) of at most no more than a half
                            billion dollars would generously satisfy all the requirements of the
                            situation, psychological and financial, and that credits in excess of
                            such an amount would be misleading and invite attempts at misuse. They
                            would be misleading in that they might lead to popular expectation of
                            practical results commensurate with the size of the credits, which would
                            not be the case, because in present circumstances there is no
                            practicable way in which such large credits could be effectively and
                            legitimately utilized. They would invite attempts at misuse on the part
                            of the self-seeking banking and government elements who would find it
                            difficult to resist the temptation to draw on such excessive credits for
                            their own gain.</p>
                        <p>Aside from the broad idea of supporting government credit and retarding
                            currency inflation, I am not informed with regard to any program for
                            using the credits requested. Conversations with Dr. Fox and with Sir
                            Otto Niemeyer lead me to believe that the Chinese Government has not
                            formulated plans for coping with the serious internal situation and is
                            therefore hardly in a position to indicate with any exactness the use it
                            expects to make of desired foreign credits. Mr. Chang Chia-ngau sets
                            forth in very general terms the need and usefulness of an internal bond
                            issue supported by foreign credits (enclosure no. 4) and the Vice
                            Ministers of Finance<note n="25" xml:id="d320fn8">O. K. Yui and Y. C.
                                Koo.</note> speak of “reconstruction” even more vaguely, and
                            unconvincingly in so far as immediate needs are concerned (enclosure no.
                            3). These, I fear, are examples illustrative of the government approach
                            to the problem. The attitude and ideas of the Minister of Finance and
                            the Minister of Economics<note n="26" xml:id="d320fn9">Wong
                                Wen-hao.</note> are no more encouraging.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of technical studies on the subject, it is difficult for
                            the Embassy to arrive at even a relatively precise idea of the
                            reasonably constructive uses to which the credit might be put. However,
                            it may serve some purpose to indicate in purely suggestive terms the
                            Embassy’s thoughts in the matter based on general observation.</p>
                        <p>A domestic bond issue, supported by foreign credits, would seem to be
                            theoretically sound and advisable. No approximately definite figures as
                            to the amount of such bonds that might be marketed are obtainable. The
                            figure of two billion Chinese dollars is the one most often mentioned
                            and under favorable conditions the amount might increase to four
                            billions. Distribution primarily among the investing public would seem
                            to be essential to accomplish the ends desired; that is, the withdrawal
                            of currency from circulation and the release of <pb n="427"
                                xml:id="pg_427" facs="0437"/>goods now being hoarded. Obviously no
                            public benefit would result from the government banks’ exchanging
                            currency in their vaults and newly issued currency for bonds backed by
                            foreign currency at a fixed rate.</p>
                        <p>Encouragement of agricultural and small industrial production is wanting
                            and badly needed. If it is feasible to do so, a portion of the credit
                            might be used to support loans or grants to agricultural interests for
                            the reclamation and improvement of farm land and to home and community
                            industrial enterprises. The Chinese Government, notwithstanding the
                            obvious advantages of such action, has been slow and reluctant to give
                            assistance but it might be induced to do so if credits were set aside
                            available only to support loans or grants of the kind. Only a very rough
                            guess can be made as to the amount that might be earmarked for this
                            purpose. Although there is slight likelihood that it would all be used,
                            one hundred million dollars might be designated for the purpose of
                            supporting grants or loans up to a billion Chinese dollars for small
                            scale production and a like amount for agricultural improvement.</p>
                        <p>In the Embassy’s telegram no. 11 of January 3, 9 [<hi rend="italic"
                                >10</hi>] a.m. Dr. Fox suggests, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>,
                            (to the Secretary of the Treasury) use of a portion of the credit to
                            promote imports from Russia into China. (He makes a similar suggestion
                            with regard to imports from India). I am not in a position to evaluate
                            the practical features of such a plan but I know that any opportunity to
                            encourage the inflow of goods into China at this time should not be
                            overlooked. One hundred million dollars of the credit might be set aside
                            for this purpose in the hope that some portion could be used to
                            accomplish the desired results.</p>
                        <p>The Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, at its meeting in
                            December last passed a resolution calling for “The execution of a land
                            policy and the institution of government machinery to deal exclusively
                            with land registration and the equalization of land ownership … ”.<note
                                n="27" xml:id="d320fn10">Omission indicated in the original.</note>
                            Various Kuomintang organs and committees have in the past passed similar
                            resolutions, the effect of which has been inconsequential. To encourage
                            implementation of the resolution quoted above, a practical step would
                            seem to be the earmarking of a portion of the credit (one hundred
                            million dollars is suggested as a generous estimate) for the support of
                            the necessary financing of the agrarian reform contemplated.</p>
                        <p>The Generalissimo stresses the psychologically beneficial effect of a
                            large political loan or credit at this time but he offers no program for
                            its use, stating that a program will be forthcoming after the credit is
                            given. I concur in his statements as to the need and the effect of a <pb
                                n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0438"/>credit (while differing with
                            regard to the amount) but I am convinced of the advisability, from the
                            Chinese point of view as well as our own, of earmarking portions of the
                            credit for certain purposes. Designation of portions of the credit for
                            support of measures suggested above may be ill-received in banking and
                            some governmental quarters but I believe that, viewing the situation as
                            a whole from the standpoint of general public welfare and from the
                            standpoint of strengthening the country’s economic structure for
                            continued resistance to Japan, it will produce more constructive results
                            than the granting of a large, lump credit or loan without designation as
                            to use. It is well not to overlook the beneficial psychological effect
                            upon the Chinese people of support for measures mentioned above (in
                            particular measures for increased production and agrarian reform); and
                            the practical effects of even partial application and implementation of
                            such measures would fully justify our support. Probably no more than
                            half the amounts suggested would be effectively used for the purposes
                            mentioned and no doublt there would be administrative difficulties and
                            inefficiencies, but even so, urgent requirements would at least be
                            partially met—production of commodities would be increased (thereby
                            removing some of the curse from currency inflation) and a start towards
                            long overdue agrarian reform would be made. And those elements in China
                            which have been urging such measures and the infinitely greater number
                            that would benefit therefrom would be encouraged and strengthened in
                            their resolve to support active prosecution of the war against Japan,
                            having received a practical demonstration that they are fighting <hi
                                rend="italic">for</hi> something. The alternative is purchase of the
                            support of the retrogressive, self-seeking, and, I fear, fickle elements
                            in and intimately associated with the government through the granting of
                            a “free” credit, for I am convinced that a substantial credit should be
                            granted.</p>

                            extend to China, our opposition to the use of any portion of such aid,
                            directly or indirectly, for the financing of expensive and harmful
                            monopolies. This is a matter which calls for no clarification on my part

                                Chiang said that China had a vast man power which it could offer to
                                help in the fight against Japan and that he had already authorized
                                the despatch of Chinese troops to aid in the defense of Burma. He
                                remarked that China was in a position to aid the other military
                                powers in a military way by man power, but that China must look to
                                America and England for aid to enable her to meet the economic and
                                financial difficulties with which it is beset. He admitted that the
                                financial situation in China is serious and that the extension of
                                the war in the Far East will be likely to result in its further
                                deterioration, and that <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0440"
                                />this is a situation which has aroused a very real concern in many
                                quarters.</p>
                            <p>General Chiang said that the Japanese were utilizing their initial
                                successes to great advantage in the field of propaganda; that
                                intelligent people did not lack confidence in the ultimate success
                                of the ABCD powers; but that the masses, the doubters, and those
                                connected with the traitors in Nanking were affected by Japanese
                                propaganda. He referred specifically to a recent radio broadcast
                                message addressed to him by the Premier of Siam, in which the
                                Premier had called upon General Chiang to join with other Far
                                Eastern nations for Far Eastern solidarity against the Western
                                nations—or “Asia for the Asiatics”. (General Chiang mentioned this
                                appeal of the Siamese Premier several times during his
                                conversation.) He said that if England and America would show their
                                confidence in China and in the ultimate victory of the democracies
                                by granting China a substantial political loan, the doubters, the
                                dissenters and the ignorant would be silenced and morale in China
                                would be greatly improved.</p>
                            <p>General Chiang stated that he had asked the British Ambassador to
                                transmit a request to his Government that it grant China a credit of
                                100 million pounds sterling, and that he wanted the American
                                Ambassador to transmit a request to the American Government that it
                                grant China a credit of about 500 million dollars.</p>
                            <p>General Chiang stated that at present China’s note issue in
                                circulation amounted to something over thirteen billion dollars
                                national currency; that the anticipated deficit for the year 1942
                                would amount to nine billion dollars. He said that the credit he
                                requested would be used partly to withdraw currency in circulation
                                through the issuance of bonds supported by the credit, and to serve
                                other purposes in regard to which plans were being formulated. He
                                said that he wanted the credit advanced first and that the plans for
                                utilization would be forthcoming afterwards. He expressed the desire
                                that the credit be granted as soon as possible in order to improve
                                morale. He referred to the fact that Chinese New Year was coming
                                soon (early in February) and said that he hoped the credit would be
                                granted before then. He asked the Ambassador to transmit his request
                                and comments to the American Government.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador said that he would of course report immediately and
                                faithfully to the American Government the request and observations
                                made by General Chiang, adding that he felt confident that the
                                American Government would be disposed to give sympathetic
                                consideration to any reasonable proposals for aid to China in her
                                resistance to Japan. He stated that he believed, however, that he
                                could be of assistance to General Chiang as well as to his own
                                Government if he were to suggest that the request made by China
                                should be accompanied by a careful presentation of the needs of the
                                situation in <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0441"/>this country
                                and a careful outline of the measures to be taken to meet the
                                situation—the measures China proposes to take to help herself and
                                the measures to be undertaken with any American loan or credit.
                                These were matters in which the considered opinions and studies of
                                the financial experts and advisors of the Chinese Government would
                                be most helpful. He pointed out that the American Congress has
                                control of the national funds in the United States, and when the
                                executive branch of the American Government has need of funds a
                                careful statement of the needs must be prepared and submitted to the
                                Congress and it must be shown how the funds, if appropriated, are to
                                be applied. The same fundamentals would seem to apply in the case of
                                a request for a loan to a foreign Power; the American Government
                                should have before it a careful statement of the needs and of the
                                measures to be undertaken with the funds from the loan; this would
                                seem to be desirable in a study of the matter by the executive
                                branch of the Government as well as in presentation of any request
                                to the Congress for an appropriation or for an authorization to
                                grant the loan. Mr. Gauss continued that he did not wish to appear
                                to be quibbling; he was not suggesting that the Generalissimo
                                formulate proposals as to the terms and conditions of the loan he
                                seeks; but he did suggest the need for a more detailed and precise
                                statement of the needs of the situation and of the measures to be
                                undertaken with the funds sought by way of a loan or credit. Mr.
                                Gauss pointed out that America had already extended substantial
                                financial aid to China—by way of import-export bank credits, a
                                stabilization fund loan, and appropriation of large sums for
                                lend-lease supplies which were being moved as rapidly as possible to
                                China. He felt that the American Government would be disposed to
                                give sympathetic consideration to China’s needs, but suggested that
                                those needs be stated more precisely along with the proposals as to
                                the purposes and manner in which any loan would be applied.</p>
                            <p>General Chiang replied that the plans for the use of the proposed
                                credit or loan were now being drawn up by the financial experts and
                                advisors of the Government; when the loan is assured, these
                                proposals can be put forward; meanwhile he requested that the
                                Ambassador put forward to the American Government the request for a
                                loan.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Gauss inquired whether the Generalissimo could tell him for
                                example, whether the proposed loan and the measures to which it was
                                to be applied, had been suggested, recommended, or approved by Sir
                                Otto Niemeyer, the head of the British Economic Mission to China.
                                General Chiang said that Sir Otto was informed of the request and it
                                had been put forward to the British Government. (He carefully
                                avoided saying whether Niemeyer had supported the proposal.)</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador continued, in a fully sympathetic manner, to impress
                                upon General Chiang the importance of a more complete presentation
                                    <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0442"/>of the proposals. He
                                acknowledged the Generalissimo’s statement that the loan sought is
                                more in the nature of a political loan than an economic loan, but
                                pointed out that it would seem most desirable to submit a more
                                complete presentation of the situation to the American Government,
                                but General Chiang’s replies were evasive and confined to
                                reiteration of the request that the proposal for the loan be
                                communicated to the American Government; information on the measures
                                and manner in which the loan would be applied could be forthcoming
                                later when the financial experts and advisors had completed their
                                studies.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador stated that he would return to the Embassy and report
                                the Generalissimo’s request and observations fully and
                                sympathetically to the American Government.</p>

                                <p>‘Secretary Morgenthau. Deeply appreciate your message December
                                    16th through Fox. Heartily agree with you on outcome of war.
                                    Thank you for considering preliminary proposal sent through
                                    Cochran but this no longer practical since spread of war in
                                    Pacific altering economic as well as strategic situation. For
                                    four and a half years China has been fighting war of resistance
                                    with untold sacrifices and heavy strain on her resources. Her
                                    financial and economic situation is now in precarious state.
                                    Brave soldiers at the front ill-fed and ill-clothed while
                                    livelihood of people difficult due to rising prices. Necessary

                                    production. If financial and economic front, already very
                                    critical, should collapse, impossible to carry on war.</p>
                                <p>Present world war developments make it imperative for democratic
                                    countries to pool their military and economic resources as their
                                    existence and survival are interdependent. Therefore, I appeal
                                    to you for a $500,000,000 political war loan. We have also
                                    approached Britain for a 100,000,000 pound loan in order to
                                    cover the total amount needed, and are awaiting their reply. Am
                                    confident if you will lead they will follow. Purpose is to

                                    restrain prices, offset diminished imports by increased
                                    production, and meet other urgent war needs. On economic grounds
                                    as well as from the standpoint of joint military front there are
                                    sound justifications for the loan but frankly my reason for
                                    approaching you is above all political. The import of such a
                                    loan is even more important than that of the Lease Lend-Bill.
                                    Timeliness is the essence of such a move in order to show
                                    China’s confidence in the allied powers is matched by equal
                                    confidence of allied powers in China in the most crucial months
                                    of emergency immediately ahead. Early announcement of loan would
                                    have immediate effect throughout Asia including Japan our common
                                    enemy as well as electrifying Chinese public opinion.
                                    Appreciation of your keen and continuing interest in China gives
                                    me confidence in sending you this telegram. H. H. Kung.’</p>

                        <p>30. For the Secretary of the Treasury from Fox: TF–14. Following is my
                            comment on telegram TF–13.</p>
                        <p>[Chinese] attitude here changed during the past few days from one of
                            despair to one of firm insistence on financial aid. Doubt if any formal
                            restrictions can be imposed now. Some form of control highly desirable
                            to assure that maximum benefit would go China and the Chinese people.
                            Believe that if early announcement of large loan can be made it would
                            have desired psychological effect and provide better opportunity for
                            obtaining some informal safeguards should all controls prove
                            impossible.</p>
                        <p>If impracticable to tie up Stabilization Board with loan, could American
                            representation be provided not as a protection for the United States but
                            in order to make certain that most effective use would be made of funds
                            in strengthening financial and economic structure of China? [Fox.]</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: We have enough evidence, I
                            think, regarding the need for us to make a loan to the Chinese, from
                            point of view of political <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0444"
                            />motivation. It is believed that it would be desirable for us to
                            proceed with this matter promptly without waiting to negotiate or confer
                            with the British about it. It is believed that if we act in a given
                            direction and set the pace, the British will follow along. It is
                            believed that, whether that assumption is or is not made, we should act;
                            and that it is desirable that we give the Chinese a promise before it
                            may become necessary to admit defeat in the Philippines (and possibly
                            defeat in Malaya).</p>
                        <p>It is recommended that arrangements be made and an assurance be given to
                            Chiang Kai-shek within a very few days that a loan will be forthcoming
                            from this country, in the amount of not less than $300 million—and
                            preferably $500 million.<note n="42" xml:id="d323fn42">Notation by the
                                Adviser on International Economic Affairs (Feis): “I wholly agree. I

                            United States Government provide China with $500,000,000 of financial

                        <p>The Generalissimo’s proposal has been given very careful consideration. I
                            feel that, as an act of wartime policy and to prevent the impairment of
                            China’s military effort which would result from loss of confidence in
                            Chinese currency and depreciation of its purchasing power, it is highly
                            advisable that the United States extend financial assistance to the
                            Government of China in amounts up to $300,000,000 at the present time. I
                            believe that a determination of this Government’s policy to this effect
                            need not await ascertainment of the attitude to be taken by Great
                            Britain on the similar Chinese proposal with reference to sterling
                            credits.</p>

                            an announcement can be made is highly important. I feel also that it
                            would seem to be highly desirable that the British Government be kept
                            currently informed of our views and decisions in regard to this matter
                            in order that the British Government may be afforded opportunity, should

                        <p rend="flushleft">I. The proposal of the Secretary is that the United
                            States should assist China in financing her military expenditures, and
                            particularly the pay and maintenance of the Chinese soldiers.</p>
                        <p>Preliminary examination indicates that a loan to China along the above
                            lines can achieve the major objectives which should be the goals of this
                            government in relation to the present loan. It would be desirable, if
                            the President agrees, to tell the Generalissimo that the Secretary is
                            ready to discuss this proposal, among others, and to make a public
                            announcement that negotiations have begun.</p>
                        <p>However, there are a number of different ways in which the Secretary’s
                            proposal might be carried out, and each of them needs to be
                            explored.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that a good deal of information essential for a
                            decision is lacking, and that each of the possible ways for carrying <pb
                                n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0446"/>out the Secretary’s proposal
                            has its strong and its weak points, it would seem desirable that the
                            announcement should be general, and not be confined to a specific
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">II. Some of the possible ways whereby the United States
                            could finance Chinese military expenditures are the following:</p>
                        <p>1. Shipment of United States’ currency to China and its issuance there as
                            pay for soldiers and other military expenditures.</p>
                        <p>2. Shipment of United States’ currency to China and its issuance there
                            for the purchase of rice and other products for distribution to and use
                            by the army.</p>
                        <p>3. Giving China dollar accounts in the United States, against which she
                            could issue bonds, the <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> proceeds of which
                            could be used for military expenditures.</p>
                        <p>4. Giving China earmarked gold, against which bonds could be issued as
                            above.</p>
                        <p>In order to evaluate these and other proposals, we ought to know more
                            than we do as to how the Chinese Government is now paying its
                            soldiers.</p>
                        <p>Our present information is only that some yuan payments are made and some
                            rice payments are made, and that there is considerable variation in the
                            amount and method of payment. Particularly with regard to the proposal
                            to distribute United States currency in China, either for pay or for
                            supplies, it is necessary to obtain more information as to how the
                            people and the Government would react to this procedure.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">III. A preliminary listing of the pros and cons of the
                            most novel of these proposals, (proposal number 1 above) is given
                            below.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">IV. Advantages of using United States’ currency to pay
                            soldiers and to meet other military expenditures in China.</p>
                        <list>

                            <item>This proposal is in accordance with the political aim of the
                                loan—to assist Chinese military effort.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>This kind of loan would meet the political necessity of making a
                                large and spectacular loan. By relating the size of the loan to the
                                size of Chinese military expenditures, this proposal helps to settle
                                the question of how large the loan should be.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The Secretary’s objective of paying out the money in installments,
                                while fighting was going on, would be achieved.</item>

                            <item>This loan should secure the good-will toward the United States of

                                particularly true, if the amount paid out to the army meant that the
                                effective purchasing power of the average soldier was
                                increased.</item>

                                accept U.S. dollars, the fight against inflation would be helped,
                                since the need to issue more Chinese currency for these purposes
                                would be eliminated.</item>

                                to hoard goods would probably be diminished. Not only because of the
                                inflation, but also because Chinese traders and merchants have had
                                considerable experience with various currencies, it would be more
                                feasible in China than elsewhere to introduce a foreign currency
                                into the monetary system.</item>

                            <item>It would be possible to meet these payments from Lend-Lease, if
                                this method is thought preferable to use of the Stabilization Fund
                                or to an authorization from Congress to lend to China.</item>
                            <label/>
                            <item>A number of the above advantages could also be achieved by the
                                issuance of bonds, payable, when due, in U.S. dollars. The use of U.
                                S. currency to pay for rice to be distributed to the troops would
                                also share in some of the above advantages. If it proves to be true
                                that the amount of yuan now paid to the troops is not large, and if
                                it is doubtful that the troops would accept pay in U.S. currency,
                                the proposal to buy rice and other supplies with U.S. currency may
                                be more feasible than proposal II 1.</item>

                                denominations which could be eventually shipped, would be too large
                                for their purposes. Accordingly, the government would have to
                                provide yuan equivalent and there would be no diminution in the

                                Therefore, the confidence in the Chinese currency might be still
                                further undermined. The Japanese, along with the Chinese
                                speculators, would want to obtain United States’ dollars for the
                                plentiful stocks of <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> which they held.

                                or, just about what the same value of gold would weigh. $10 million
                                worth of $5. notes weigh over two tons. Shipment of this amount of
                                small notes by air would, therefore, be a considerable undertaking,
                                    <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0448"/>at a time when much

                                Both governments would use up a good deal of energy and

                        <p>At the request of Mr. Morgenthau, conveyed to me orally late yesterday
                            afternoon by Mr. Coe, I went to Mr. Morgenthau’s office this morning at
                            9:15. I found there the other officers above listed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Morgenthau opened the conversation with reference to a meeting which
                            had been held in his office yesterday afternoon in the course of which
                            he had suggested that U.S. financial assistance to China <pb n="439"
                                xml:id="pg_439" facs="0449"/>(Chiang Kai-shek’s request for a loan)
                            might perhaps be handled advantageously by means of this Government’s
                            undertaking to devote certain sums of money per month to the support of
                            Chiang Kai-shek’s army (payment of soldiers). Mr. Morgenthau said that
                            Dr. Soong had reacted very favorably. He went on to say that last
                            evening he had dined at the British Embassy and had been “very
                            indiscreet—and had enjoyed being so”. He said that he had talked with
                            Lord Halifax<note n="49" xml:id="d327fn49">British Ambassador in the
                                United States.</note> and Mr. Churchill; that he had caused
                            Churchill to put his mind intently upon China for a whole hour; that
                            both Halifax and Churchill had responded favorably to the financial idea
                            which he, Mr. Morgenthau, had propounded; that Churchill had said that
                            in whatever direction the U.S. Treasury might wish to proceed toward
                            support of China, England would go along. Mr. Morgenthau said that he
                            had mentioned Sir Otto Niemeyer, his presence in China, and suggestions
                            which he was reported to have made. He said that Mr. Churchill or Lord
                            Halifax (??) had said that he knew Niemeyer well, that … he wondered who
                            had sent him to China, and that they would pull him out immediately. Mr.
                            Morgenthau said, as an aside, that he would wager that a hot telegram
                            had gone out from the British Embassy about Niemeyer last night. Mr.
                            Morgenthau then threw open for discussion his proposal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Coe said that a memorandum on the subject had been written last
                            night. A copy of that memorandum was on Mr. Morgenthau’s desk. Mr. Coe
                            gave Mr. Currie and me copies.<note n="50" xml:id="d327fn50">
                                <hi rend="italic">Supra.</hi>
                            </note> With apparently little reference to the memorandum, the Treasury
                            officers and Mr. Currie then engaged for twenty minutes in a lively
                            discussion of U.S. dollars, silver dollars, Mexican dollars, U.S. paper
                            dollars, “fapi”, rice, etc.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. Morgenthau’s secretary reminded him of another engagement.
                            Mr. Morgenthau asked me what the Department of State thought of his
                            proposal. [I had been informed briefly yesterday afternoon by Mr. Coe of
                            the fundamental feature of the proposal; and I had informed the
                            Secretary and Mr. Berle and Mr. Hamilton<note n="51" xml:id="d327fn51"
                                >Maxwell M. Hamilton, Chief of the Division of Far Eastern
                                Affairs.</note> of it; and I had the first reaction of each.]<note
                                n="52" xml:id="d327fn52">Brackets appear in the original.</note> I
                            replied to Mr. Morgenthau that this matter had been brought to our
                            attention only late yesterday afternoon and I could not say that there
                            had been formulated a State Department opinion. I would wish to point
                            out, however, on my own responsibility one or two things. First, Chiang
                            Kai-shek had asked for a loan in terms which indicated that he wanted
                            something which would be of political advantage to him, the situation in
                            China and his problems being what they are. I sketched briefly what I
                            conceived <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0450"/>to be the political
                            problem. I said that I did not think that it would be practicable for us
                            to envisage making ourselves paymasters of the Chinese soldiery; that
                            the situation does not lend itself to that; that our problem is that of
                            clearly indicating to the Chinese nation and all concerned that we have
                            confidence in China, in China as represented by and functioning through
                            the Chiang Kai-shek (Chungking) Government; and that we intend to give a
                            full measure of practical support to China in terms of that Government
                            as an important member in the United Nations group.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Morgenthau then asked that the group, except himself, adjourn to Mr.
                            Bell’s office and continue the discussion.</p>
                        <p>In Mr. Bell’s office there was about thirty minutes of discussion. There,
                            Dr. Currie and Dr. Viner brought matters down to earth and emphasized
                            the fact that if we make this loan we will make it for the purpose of
                            attaining certain political objectives, that we must do it in a way
                            which will best serve those objectives. I called attention to the
                            telegraphic reports which we have had of what Chiang Kai-shek said to
                            Mr. Gauss, Mr. Gauss’ comments thereon, Mr. Fox’s comments and
                            suggestions, Dr. Kung’s message, etc. I emphasized that the problem
                            involved is first of all political, that we must try to understand
                            clearly the essential features of that problem and then try to shape our
                            action in the light of those features and with our eyes on the main
                            objectives to be served. Mr. Bell summed the matter up in a manner which
                            led to my remarking that Mr. Bell’s words were almost identical with a
                            statement which I had heard the Secretary of State make and I called
                            attention to the Secretary of State’s letter of January 10.</p>
                        <p>I walked from the Treasury Department to this Department with Dr. Currie.
                            I find that Dr. Currie’s views coincide largely with those held here,
                            but that Dr. Currie has some concept of being able to make additional
                            financial aid to China available through Lend-Lease channels. I
                            mentioned as possibly advantageous in theory at least the procedure of
                            proposing that a congressional authorization and appropriation be
                            obtained—for the sake of the emphatic political effect both here and in
                            China of such action.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Coe informed me, on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury, late
                            yesterday afternoon, as follows:</p>
                        <p>Mr. Coe said that after the conference in Mr. Morgenthau’s office
                            yesterday morning Mr. Morgenthau had gone to the President. Mr.
                            Morgenthau <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0451"/>later had stated
                            that he had put before the President his, Mr. Morgenthau’s, plan for
                            assisting China by advancing sums of money monthly for payment of
                            soldiers, that the President was enthusiastic; that it had been agreed
                            that Mr. Morgenthau should propose to T. V. Soong that United States
                            undertake to advance money monthly for “payment” of 1,000,000 Chinese
                            soldiers at rate of $5 U. S. currency per month and, further, money for
                            “maintenance” of another million Chinese soldiers at the same rate, $5
                            U. S. currency per month; that Mr. Morgenthau had put this up to T. V.
                            Soong; and that T. V. Soong was telegraphing to his Government.</p>
                        <p>I asked Mr. Coe whether Mr. Morgenthau or the President had consulted the
                            Secretary of State with regard to this. Mr. Coe indicated that he
                            thought that they had not. I asked whether, in as much as it seemed to
                            be agreed in all quarters that this matter was of importance first of
                            all from political angles, it would not seem to him that the Secretary
                            of State should be consulted and should participate fully in reaching a
                            decision. Mr. Coe said that the matter seemed to have been decided and
                            that Mr. Morgenthau was going to leave town tomorrow (this morning) to
                            be away for about a week: he was to leave this loan matter in the hands
                            of Mr. Bell. Mr. Coe suggested that if I wished to make any suggestions
                            to Mr. Morgenthau I telephone him at his home.</p>
                        <p>The above reported conversation having been concluded, I immediately
                            informed the Secretary of State and I a few minutes later informed Mr.
                            Livesey and still later Mr. Berle of what had been said. Later in the
                            evening, I discussed the matter with Mr. Jacob Viner, of the Treasury.
                            In the light of what was said in those conversations, I decided to take
                            no further action last evening. I have this morning discussed the matter
                            further with Mr. Livesey.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Bell</hi>: Mr. Coe, speaking, I
                            understood, under instructions from the Secretary of the Treasury,
                            informed me yesterday afternoon of latest developments in the matter of
                            the proposed new financial assistance to China.</p>
                        <p>Without undertaking in this context to express an opinion regarding the
                            merits of the plan which I understand was decided upon by the Secretary
                            of the Treasury and the President yesterday, and laid before Dr. T. V.
                            Soong, I wish to go on record as asking, on my own responsibility and in
                            light of the fact that the Treasury has drawn <pb n="442"
                                xml:id="pg_442" facs="0452"/>me into the discussion of the matter,
                            whether the procedure envisaged in this plan, whatever may be the other
                            objectives which it might serve or effects which it might have, can be
                            expected to serve substantially either the political or the economic
                            objectives which apparently have been in Chiang Kai-shek’s and H. H.
                            Kung’s minds in connection with the appeals which they have made for a
                            loan and in the minds of Mr. Gauss and Mr. Fox in connection with the
                            comments and suggestions which they have offered in relation to the
                            question of a loan, and which have been in the minds of officers of the
                            Department of State who have studied those appeals, comments and
                            suggestions and the situation out of which they arise.</p>

                            of telegrams which have borne on this subject.<note n="53"

                            prior to the receipt of your telegram under reference I spoke to other
                            officials here in regard to the advisability of this Government’s
                            extending a large loan to China. After receipt of your telegram I spoke
                            again about the matter. I also recommended to the Secretary of the
                            Treasury that a loan, substantial in amount, be made.</p>
                        <p>A few days ago the President took the matter up with the Secretary of the
                            Treasury and I understand that the Secretary of the Treasury has been
                            giving the matter most active consideration and that the Secretary of
                            the Treasury has communicated to T. V. Soong the outline of a specific
                            proposal which Soong is referring to his Government.</p>

                            this report.<note n="55" xml:id="d331fn55">i. e., paraphrase of a
                                message received in the War Department on January 22 from the
                                Military Attaché in Portugal, and received in the Department of
                                State on January 23, the lines under reference reading: “A recent
                                statement by a Japanese diplomat says that Japan expects to
                                terminate the war in the Pacific in February by taking Java, Sumatra
                                and the Philippines and by closing the Burma Road. Peace between
                                China and Japan would soon follow.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is by no means inconceivable that the Japanese expect to take Java,
                            Sumatra, the Philippines and Rangoon by the end of February; <pb n="443"
                                xml:id="pg_443" facs="0453"/>and by no means impossible that,
                            regardless of resistance at Singapore, they may accomplish all that.</p>
                        <p>If it should so happen, Japanese pressure on China to make peace would be
                            intense, and a tendency to accept the “logic” of the situation and cease
                            resistance would be given momentum in some quarters in China.</p>
                        <p>Conclusion of peace between China and Japan would be a terrible blow to
                            the United Nations cause. If Japan once gets undisputed control of the
                            terrain, the natural resources and possibly the man power of China (in
                            addition to the continental area south of China and the insular areas in
                            the Western Pacific) the British Empire will soon have been smashed, the
                            British Isles will have little chance of standing out for long against
                            the Axis, and the likelihood of this country being left as the sole
                            fighting enemy of the Axis powers would be great.</p>
                        <p>It behooves us to have these possibilities in mind in connection with the
                            consideration which we give to Chiang Kai-shek’s request for a large
                            loan at an early date from this country. It is believed that by way of
                            political and military insurance, we could well afford to and we should
                            make a favorable response at an early date to Chiang’s representations
                            in that matter. Now is the time for us to tie China into our war (which
                            still is her war) as tight as possible. If we fail to do this, because
                            of misgivings or peculiar solicitudes regarding the amount of money
                            involved, an amount which is small in comparison with our cheerful
                            outlays for military equipment, we stand a substantial chance of losing
                            within a few weeks or months the strongest (in the Pacific) of our three
                            fighting associates in that area.<note n="56" xml:id="d331fn56">

                                            remark: The apparent lack, of which I have new evidence
                                            every day, of adequate understanding on the part of high
                                            officials of this Government of the miracle of warmaking
                                            which the Chinese have performed during the past four
                                            and one-half years, not excluding the period since we
                                            entered the war, and the apparent inability of many high
                                            officials, both civilian and military, in this
                                            Government, adequately to evaluate the existing and the
                                            potential war spirit and war capacity of the Chinese
                                            nation as a member of the fighting group within the
                                            United Nations association is amazing, distressing and
                                            alarming. As the minister of a foreign power here in
                                            Washington recently stated, this war in which we are
                                            engaged cannot be won in the Far Eastern theater but it
                                            could be lost there. Neither the British Government nor
                                            the American Government makes one-half the effort that
                                            each and both should make to evaluate accurately the
                                            psychological factors involved in the question of
                                            China’s functioning as an outstandingly valuable

                        <p>The Secretary’s office called Mr. Hornbeck this morning and stated that
                            the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury had been
                            conferring about the proposed loan to China<note n="57"
                                xml:id="d332fn57">See letter of January 21 from the Chinese Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs to the Secretary of the Treasury, Department of

                                ([Washington,] 1949), p. 478.</note> and it had been agreed that Mr.
                            Southard of the Treasury should confer with Dr. Feis and Mr. Hornbeck
                            about the matter. A few minutes later Mr. Southard called Mr. Hornbeck
                            and asked for an appointment with Mr. Hornbeck and Dr. Feis. Mr.
                            Hornbeck suggested, for reference to the Secretary of the Treasury, that
                            Mr. Berle and Dr. Currie be also included. Mr. Hornbeck next asked the
                            Secretary’s office for the Secretary’s authorization to make that
                            inclusion. This was approved. The Secretary shortly thereafter suggested
                            to Mr. Hamilton that Mr. Hamilton keep in touch with this matter.</p>
                        <p>At 2:30 this afternoon Messrs. Southard, Bernstein and Friedman came to
                            Mr. Hornbeck’s office and were taken by Mr. Hornbeck down to Mr. Berle’s
                            office. Dr. Feis shortly thereafter joined the group. Dr. Currie was out
                            of town. Mr. Hamilton was occupied with other and necessary
                            business.</p>
                        <p>In the discussion in Mr. Berle’s office, points were brought out as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck said at the outset that he was present because he had been
                            told to participate and had been involved in organizing the meeting; he
                            said that he had already expressed, in his capacity of political
                            adviser, his views regarding the general subject under discussion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Berle expressed an opinion that Mr. Hornbeck could not so easily
                            divest himself of responsibility in relation to procedures which might
                            follow. Mr. Berle briefly summarized his concept of what had occurred up
                            to date with regard to Chiang Kai-shek’s request for a loan, and
                            concluded his statement with an expression of opinion that the project
                            for more or less directly financing the Chinese armies had met with a
                            conclusively unfavorable reply by Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
                        <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0455"/>
                        <p>Mr. Bernstein indicated that, such being the case, the problem before
                            this meeting was to consider what to do next. Mr. Friedman made mention
                            of the question of turning dollars into yuan and deciding upon amounts
                            and periods involved.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck suggested that attention be focused first of all on what it
                            is that Chiang Kai-shek has asked for: he recalled that in several
                            telegrams Chiang has requested a loan of $500,000,000 “without strings”.
                            He touched upon what he conceived to be Chiang’s view of the problem and
                            the possibilities. He said that in essence what Chiang apparently wants
                            is an expression of confidence on the part of the United States in
                            China, China’s moral and military intentions and capacity, the Chungking
                            Government, and Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang’s problems are political,
                            military and economic. The Chinese want the fullest possible recognition
                            of their full participation in the associated effort of the United
                            Nations in resistance to the common enemies; they want to be treated and
                            be treated with as we treat and treat with the British and others with
                            whom we deal on a basis of human parity. For our purposes, we should
                            consider the problem of this loan as one concerned primarily with
                            political features and only in a very minor sense with financial
                            features. If we make this loan, we should make it to serve political and
                            military objectives, not as a business or a banking deal. We should make
                            the loan promptly and in generous amount. Could we not say to the
                            Chinese at an early date that we are definitely prepared to support them
                            to the extent of several hundred million dollars and we are ready to
                            discuss with them plans and procedures which need to be adopted by
                            common consent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Friedman and Mr. Berle raised certain questions regarding possible
                            safeguards and possible fractionalizing of the total sum into monthly or
                            quarterly amounts.</p>
                        <p>There came up the question of official and unofficial opinions. Mr.
                            Hornbeck stated that the Department of State had committed itself
                            officially in one context only: in response to a request which had
                            issued from a meeting held at the Treasury some ten or twelve days ago
                            the Secretary of State had sent the Secretary of the Treasury a letter
                            recommending that a loan be made in the amount of, say, $300,000,000 as
                            soon as possible. Mr. Bernstein raised question regarding a State
                            Department memorandum of January 23.<note n="58" xml:id="d332fn58">Not
                                found in Department files.</note> It turned out that this was a
                            memorandum which had been prepared by Messrs. Berle and Feis and been
                            concurred in by Messrs. Hamilton and Hornbeck, for the Secretary of
                            State, of which, apparently, the Secretary of State had given the
                            Secretary of the Treasury a copy. Mr. Hornbeck expressed opinion, later
                            concurred in by Mr. Berle, that this was not to be <pb n="446"
                                xml:id="pg_446" facs="0456"/>regarded as an official commitment or
                            communication by or on the part of the Secretary of State but was to be
                            regarded as something affording a basis for discussion.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Feis said that he would recommend that the Congress be asked to
                            appropriate $500,000,000 with an understanding that details would be
                            worked out between the Chinese and the appropriate agencies of the
                            American Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck called attention to the fact that the Chinese had asked not
                            only of this Government a loan of $500,000,000 but also of the British
                            Government a loan of similar amount, the two together to be
                            $1,000,000,000. He suggested that we keep this in mind while considering
                            what sum we might be willing to put up. One of the Treasury officials
                            asked for an opinion how far we should try for parallel action by the
                            British. Mr. Hornbeck pointed out that the Secretary of State had
                            suggested that we should not wait upon action by or with the British but
                            should inform the British of our thoughts and intentions, affording them
                            an opportunity to take action in the light of their knowledge of our
                            action. He suggested that frequently one of the best ways to get the
                            British to act is to take action and expect them to act in order to save
                            themselves from being left behind.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Berle said that if it were a matter of having to choose between
                            giving the Chinese a loan of $500,000,000 without strings or losing the
                            potentially advantageous political effects of a loan through too great
                            solicitude with regard to strings, he would favor the former.</p>
                        <p>There appeared to be a consensus of opinion that if it could be decided
                            that a loan could be made in substantial amount, and if the Chinese
                            could be informed of this fact with an indication that this decision was
                            tentative and there must be knowledge on our part of and conference
                            regarding purposes for which the Chinese would expect to use this
                            assistance, safeguards could be provided, by discussion, which would
                            serve purposes useful both to China and to United States.</p>
                        <p>In the course of a brief after-meeting discussion with Messrs. Southard,
                            Bernstein and Friedman, Mr. Hornbeck by way of summarizing gave a brief
                            review of American-Chinese relations in the field of loans and credits
                            over the period of the last three decades, especially the period from
                            1933 to date, and said that he felt that we have a good deal of leverage
                            in regard to Chinese handling of the proceeds of a loan in the fact that
                            while profiting by one loan the Chinese have their minds on the subject
                            of a later to-be-hoped-for loan. He said that he felt that we could gain
                            great present advantage in connection with our problem of the war in its
                            present defensive stage through being generous now with the Chinese,
                            being helpful to maximum extent to Chiang and his major leaders,
                            convincing the Chinese that we expect to help them to the full extent of
                            our capacity and expect them to reciprocate, et cetera; he felt that,
                            first, the Treasury and the President <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447"
                                facs="0457"/>must find a basis on which we can make a promise in
                            principle; second, we should say to the Chinese that we are in position
                            to make them a substantial loan and that we would appreciate having them
                            give us an outline of their concept of uses to be made and having
                            certain persons representing them sit with representatives of the
                            Treasury Department and representatives of the State Department with a
                            view to adoption of a plan freely acceptable to both Governments.</p>

                            General Chiang Kai-shek’s recent request for financial assistance. They
                            propose to inform him that His Majesty’s Government have decided to make
                            available to China under a lend-lease arrangement all munitions and
                            military equipment that it is possible for them to supply. In particular
                            this proposal would apply to stores which are being supplied to Chinese

                            “psychological” sterling loan. Such a sterling loan would not be of
                            actual help in present circumstances. After the war it would represent
                            money available to China for the purchase either of goods or of gold and

                            States Government is in a position to take an independent decision,
                            should they wish not only to take part in the Niemeyer-Young scheme, but
                            also to offer further dollar loans. His Majesty’s Government are merely
                            stating their own position.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Gray<note n="62" xml:id="d334fn62">Cecil W. Gray, Assistant to the
                                Secretary of State.</note> informed me this morning that the
                            Secretary had expressed in terms of a query the thought that it would be
                            desirable for this Government to inform the Chinese at an early date
                            that we are prepared to make them a substantial loan and to discuss with
                            them such points as may need to be discussed in relation thereto.</p>
                        <p>Having in mind the conversation which was held in Mr. Berle’s office on
                            January 26 between officers of this Department and officers of the
                            Treasury Department on the subject of the proposed loan to China, I
                            called Mr. Southard of the Treasury Department on the telephone and
                            informed him of the above mentioned expression of the views of the
                            Secretary of State. I inquired whether Mr. Southard had seen information
                            which came yesterday from Mr. Fox to the effect that Mr. Fox has been
                            delayed at Calcutta. Mr. Southard replied that the Treasury had received
                            Fox’s message and had already replied to it. I pointed out that Mr. Fox
                            obviously will not reach Washington at the end of this week. Mr.
                            Southard replied that Fox could not reach here before February 5 at
                            best. I expressed a hope that the Treasury was finding it possible to
                            make progress with consideration of the question of a loan. Mr. Southard
                            replied that Mr. White has now arrived back from South America and is
                            again “on the job”, and that the question of a loan is being given the
                            Treasury’s active consideration. I thanked Mr. Southard and expressed a
                            hope that they would keep us constantly informed of developments. Mr.
                            Southard indicated that he would try to do so.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. White of the Treasury Department called me on the phone late this
                            afternoon and between us there was reviewed what has transpired
                            regarding the currently proposed loan to China. (Mr. White has been
                            absent from Washington since shortly after this subject first came up
                            and had returned to Washington this morning.)</p>
                        <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0459"/>
                        <p>In the course of this conversation, Mr. White said that the Secretary of
                            the Treasury had stated to him that the Secretary of State had said that
                            there was no urgency about this matter and it could well wait until Mr.
                            Fox reaches Washington. I made comment that I would assume that such a
                            statement, if made by the Secretary of State, had been made in the light
                            of an understanding that Mr. Fox was to reach Washington by the end of
                            this week; but that, in as much as we now know that Mr. Fox cannot be
                            here before February 5 if then, I doubted whether any such statement
                            should be regarded as contemplating other than the originally expected
                            interval of time. I made mention of the Secretary of State’s expression
                            of opinion relayed to me by Mr. Gray this morning, which I had relayed
                            to Mr. Southard this afternoon, that it would be desirable to act on
                            this matter at an early date.</p>
                        <p>There followed some discussion of the political aspects of the loan. Mr.
                            White said that he was not surprised that Chiang Kai-shek had reacted
                            unfavorably to the proposal which had been made by the Secretary of the
                            Treasury through T. V. Soong to Chiang.<note n="63" xml:id="d335fn63"
                                >See memorandum of January 12 by the Assistant Chief of the Division
                                of Monetary Research, Treasury Department, <ref target="#pg_435">p.
                                    435</ref>.</note> I emphasized the point that in any discussions
                            which may be had with the Chinese, it would seem desirable that this
                            Department’s views as well as those of the Treasury be given full
                            consideration. Mr. White inquired whether the Secretary of State had not
                            been a party to the plan which had been proposed to the Chinese. I
                            replied that the Secretary of State had been in no way a party to that
                            proposal and that the only participation which this Department had had
                            in discussion of that proposal was participation on my part, at the
                            request of the Secretary of the Treasury, in course of which I had
                            expressly stated that I was expressing only my personal opinions and was
                            not speaking officially or as representing an official Department of
                            State view.<note n="64" xml:id="d335fn64">Mr. Hornbeck here apparently
                                is referring to a conversation he had with Treasury officers on

                        <p>Mr. White indicated that he would try to push matters in consideration of
                            the loan with the Treasury Department’s experts tomorrow.</p>

                                If they don’t want dollar notes, why don’t we buy Chinese yuans and
                                use them for paying for the equipment of Chinese troops in China

                            instance seems to me to be the least desirable, because of the special
                            character of the proposed financial aid. Should it be decided to use the
                            Stabilization Fund for this purpose, it will be necessary to obtain the
                            approval of the Congressional Committees in the same manner as you and I
                            obtained it in December, 1940, in connection with the $50 million
                            Chinese Stabilization arrangement.<note n="69" xml:id="d337fn69">See

                            meeting promptly with the Congressional leaders to advise them of the
                            problem and to discuss the alternative methods of financial assistance.
                            With their clearance, it would be possible for the President to make an
                            immediate announcement that he and the Congressional leaders are
                            prepared, subject to the necessary Congressional action, to grant China
                            the financial assistance requested by Chiang-Kai-shek. The details could
                            be worked out later.</p>

                            Therefor</p>
                        <p>On December 30, 1941 General Chiang Kai-shek expressly asked that the
                            Government of the United States extend to China promptly a large loan
                            (principally for political purposes and principally as a mark of
                            confidence in China). A few days ago General Chiang Kai-shek renewed
                            this express request.</p>
                        <p>For four and one-half years Chiang Kai-shek has been the backbone and
                            fountainhead of Chinese resistance in much the same way as George
                            Washington was the backbone and fountainhead of this country’s fight for
                            independence. It would be a very serious matter to do anything which
                            would shake Chiang Kai-shek’s confidence in the United States or make
                            his position in China more difficult than it is.</p>
                        <p>Following the entry of the United States into the war, the United States
                            in the Declaration of United Nations<note n="70" xml:id="d338fn70">Dated
                                January 1, 1942, Department of State <hi rend="italic"
                                >Bulletin</hi>, January 3, 1942, p. 3.</note> for the first time
                            gave concrete manifestation of acceptance of China as a full-fledged
                            partner. Such acceptance on the part of the United States is a matter
                            which is very close to Chiang Kai-shek’s heart. In the military
                            situation in the western Pacific China and Chiang Kai-shek have been
                            given certain recognition. It is doubtful, however, whether <hi
                                rend="italic">in Chinese eyes</hi> current military arrangements
                            give China as important a place as many Chinese feel is her due.</p>
                        <p>China has, of course, been greatly disappointed at the severe reverses
                            suffered by the Allied Forces in the western Pacific. Whether during the
                            next few months further reverses will be suffered or whether the
                            Japanese will be checked, only the future can tell. In either
                            contingency the best assurance of continued unity in our relations with
                            China is to regard China politically and psychologically as a full and
                            equal partner in the war against our common enemies. Should further
                            severe defeats to Allied Forces ensue and should China temporarily be
                            virtually cut off through closure of the Burma Road from access to her
                            friends, the likelihood of China’s perseverance in her war effort would
                            be substantially enhanced by the granting now of the loan requested by
                            Chiang Kai-shek. Should the Japanese onrush be checked, the giving now
                            to China of a “vote of confidence” would substantially contribute to
                            causing China to push her war preparations against Japan with renewed
                            energy.</p>
                        <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0463"/>
                        <p>We know that China’s economic and financial condition is urgently in need
                            of being strengthened. Chiang Kai-shek, however, seems, in asking for a
                            large loan at this time, to have in mind primarily political aspects,
                            including the question of China’s morale.</p>
                        <p>What we can do for China at the present time is limited. We cannot get to
                            China the military supplies and possibly the armed forces which we would
                            like to send. In the field of financial aid, the Government of the
                            United States has the ability to act promptly. Whether China could
                            immediately use the proceeds of a large loan is not, it is believed, of
                            outstanding importance. Any loan granted would, it is assumed, be
                            regarded as a war loan and any portion of the loan not used in and
                            directly connected with the war effort would presumably revert to the
                            United States.</p>

                        <p>The principal considerations in favor of making this loan, in substantial
                            amount, at this time are, it is believed: First, Chiang has in the
                            political setup in China constantly to deal with certain opposition
                            elements, some of which are favorable to Germany and some favorable to
                            Japan or to the idea of making peace with Japan rather than persevering
                            in difficult and expensive resistance (the loan will greatly strengthen
                            Chiang); second, the making of this loan at this time when there is
                            uncertainty regarding the immediate future of our own military situation
                            in the military operations in the western Pacific theater would signify
                            more of confidence on our part both in our own capacity and intention
                            and in China’s capacity and intention to see the fight carried through
                            to victory than would postponement of the making of the loan until a
                            moment when we may be on the eve of or freshly subjected to new and
                            substantial reverses, at which time the making of this loan might be
                            said to have the appearance of addressing an appeal for help to an ally
                            to whom up to the moment when we found ourselves in difficulty we had
                            been none too generous about giving help. The question of “timing” can
                            be argued both ways, but <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0464"/>it is
                            believed that the balance of advantage lies in favor of doing the deed
                            while Chiang’s requests are fairly fresh rather than waiting and letting
                            it appear that our decision arises essentially out of our own
                            necessities.</p>

                        <p>China is now in her fifth year of war against aggression and has had to
                            draw very heavily upon her own resources. Certain loans have been made
                            to China through the Federal Loan Agency, mostly in connection with the
                            purchase of strategic materials. These loans have been used to buy
                            supplies in this country, but China now needs cash to be used within, or
                            from within, its own borders, and I strongly recommend that you ask
                            Congress to authorize loans, or credits, or both, to China up to
                            $500,000,000. The brilliant resistance to aggression which the Chinese
                            have made and are making, and their contribution to the common cause,
                            deserve the fullest support we can give.</p>

                            <p>In view of further representations from His Majesty’s Ambassador in
                                Chungking, His Majesty’s Government feel that it is essential to
                                send an immediate reply to the Generalissimo. It is understood that
                                the question of assistance to China is under the President’s
                                consideration.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty’s Government now suggest that in addition to their
                                supplying munitions on a lend-lease basis a joint offer should be
                                made of a combined loan of $400 millions, of which, in view of the
                                disparity of financial resources, the British share would be $120
                                millions or £30 millions. The latter sum would be made available
                                immediately but there would be an unpublished understanding that it
                                would be drawn upon only as required for expenditure in the sterling
                                area directly required for the war; each item of expenditure being
                                agreed upon between the two governments with the condition that any
                                amount that had not been drawn upon at the conclusion of hostilities
                                would be repaid. The United States part of the credit would no doubt
                                be made subject to similar conditions.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty’s Government ask whether the President would agree that
                                we should at once inform the Generalissimo that we have made this
                                proposal to the United States Government.<note n="75"
                                    xml:id="d342fn75">In a memorandum dated February 4, 1942, the
                                    Chief of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs (Hamilton) stated:
                                    “I talked with Mr. White of the Treasury Department over the
                                    telephone in regard to the enclosure to the attached letter and
                                    raised the question whether any action was called for by the
                                    last paragraph of the enclosure. After discussion, there was
                                    agreement between Mr. White and myself that this matter had been
                                    disposed of by the decisions reached by the American and the
                                    British Governments, respectively, and by the announcements of
                                    decisions made by each Government. Mr. White said that, when a
                                    decision had been reached here to seek Congressional

                        <p>It is a source of great gratification to me and to the Government and
                            people of the United States that the proposal which I made to the
                            Congress that there be authorized for the purpose of rendering financial
                            aid to China in the sum of $500,000,000 was passed unanimously by both
                            the Senate and the House of Representatives and has now become law.<note
                                n="78" xml:id="d344fn78">Approved February 7; 56 Stat. 82.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The unusual speed and unanimity with which this measure was acted upon by
                            the Congress and the enthusiastic support which it received throughout
                            the United States testify to the wholehearted respect and admiration
                            which the Government and people of this country have for China. They
                            testify also to our earnest desire and determination to be concretely
                            helpful to our partners in the great battle for freedom. The gallant
                            resistance of the Chinese armies <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0467"
                            />against the ruthless invaders of your country has called forth the
                            highest praise from the American and all other freedom-loving peoples.
                            The tenacity of the Chinese people, both armed and unarmed, in the face
                            of tremendous odds in carrying on for almost five years a resolute
                            defense against an enemy far superior in equipment is an inspiration to
                            the fighting men and all the peoples of the other United Nations. The
                            great sacrifices of the Chinese people in destroying the fruits of their
                            toil so that they could not be used by the predatory armies of Japan
                            exemplify in high degree the spirit of sacrifice which is necessary on
                            the part of all to gain the victory toward which we are confidently
                            striving. It is my hope and belief that use which will be made of the
                            funds now authorized by the Congress of the United States will
                            contribute substantially toward facilitating the efforts of the Chinese
                            Government and people to meet the economic and financial burdens which
                            have been thrust upon them by an armed invasion and toward solution of
                            problems of production and procurement which are essential for the
                            success of their armed resistance to what are now our common
                            enemies.</p>
                        <p>I send you my personal greetings and best wishes. I extend to you across
                            land and sea the hand of comradeship for the common good, the common
                            goal, the common victory that shall be ours.</p>

                        <p>73. In the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald Tribune</hi> of February 6
                            there is an article under Washington date line in regard to the passage
                            by the Senate of the bill authorizing the extension of financial aid to
                            China. In this article there is the statement that Mr. Long<note n="79"

                            Committee the view that some influential people in China were attempting
                            to influence Chiang Kai-shek to make a separate peace; that Chiang
                            Kai-shek was standing firm; but that some of those around him were
                            wavering.</p>
                        <p>The Department doubts whether you should take any initiative in the
                            matter. In case the report mentioned above should be forwarded to

                            regretted; that the hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee was in
                            executive session; that Mr. Long, after making a general statement in
                            hearty support and explanation of the bill, was asked some <pb n="458"
                                xml:id="pg_458" facs="0468"/>specific questions; that Mr. Long, in
                            reply to one of these questions, made some general statements along the

                        </p>
                        <p>Practically all who have been connected with the matter are agreed that
                            the primary motivation and objective of the appropriation of
                            $500,000,000 for use in giving financial aid to China has been
                            political, that the use of this money is to be for promotion of the
                            Chinese war effort as a part of the United Nations war effort, and that
                            in making this money available to the Chinese Government we should not
                            attempt unduly to put transactions which may be entered into on a
                            banking or orthodox commercial basis.</p>
                        <p>The legislation involved has specified that transactions shall be handled
                            by the Secretary of the Treasury with the approval of the President. It
                            has been understood, however, throughout, that, because of the political
                            aspects of the matter, this Department has an appropriate and
                            substantial concern with regard to all phases of the matter.</p>
                        <p>The money is now available.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that political advantage would be gained were the American
                            Government now to take the initiative in approaching the Chinese with a
                            proposal or proposals looking toward immediately making available to the
                            Chinese Government of some portion of the money.</p>
                        <p>There is ample warrant for assuming that Chiang Kai-shek could use some
                            of this money to advantage toward immediate remedying of certain weak
                            spots in his political, military and economic fences: that he could to
                            advantage use some of this money for purposes which he would not wish to
                            divulge and which it would be better that he be not asked to
                            explain.</p>
                        <p>Is there any good reason why this Government should not proceed at once
                            to arrange for a conference which might be participated in by
                            representatives of the Treasury, of this Department and of the Chinese
                            Embassy and/or T. V. Soong’s purchasing agency (Mr. Fox, who has just
                            returned from China, and Mr. Currie might perhaps also be included)—for
                            the purpose of considering an arrangement for an early allotment of a
                            part of the funds?</p>
                        <p>Is there any good reason why there might not be advanced on the part of
                            this Government a proposal for a straight loan to the Chinese Government
                            of $100,000,000, a loan on the basis of a simple agreement whereby China
                            would undertake to pay interest and pay out the principal on the basis
                            of an amortization schedule?</p>

                        <p>The problem is to find some way of using in whole or in part the
                            $500,000,000 credit authorized for China to bolster up the Chinese
                            monetary and fiscal system in spite of the disruption of commercial and
                            financial intercourse which normally functions as the channel through
                            which such international assistance is made effective. Whatever
                            psychological benefit can be derived from the credit has probably
                            already largely been realized. Broadly speaking the tangible benefits
                            which may be realized from the foreign purchasing power made available
                            to the Government of China would appear to derive from its use for the
                            purchase of imports or its sale to residents of China in exchange for
                            domestic purchasing power. China, for the foreseeable future, cannot
                            effectively use for imports the foreign exchange resources already
                            available to it. The only effective way of using its dollars immediately
                            would appear to be by their sale to residents of China or as a guaranty
                            for the repayment in dollars of the principal of an internal Chinese
                            loan.</p>
                        <p>The first would have the advantage of promptly supplying the Chinese
                            Government with local funds from a source other than the printing press.
                            Such a plan might be effected by having the Stabilization Board of China
                            through designated banks undertake sales of dollars in the open market.
                            It might also to some extent increase the exchange value of the yuan
                            vis-à-vis the dollar and might at least to a limited extent operate as a
                            psychological factor against further increase in the price level. On the
                            other hand it would in effect simply permit a flight of private capital
                            from China—capital which no doubt has in large part been accumulated
                            from the easy speculative profits which inhere in a highly inflationary
                            situation. The possibilities of graft and the abuse of such a system
                            need hardly be elaborated nor the obvious fact that if the dollars were
                            sold merely against additional issues of yuan the net result will merely
                            have been a complete waste of the resources made available to China to
                            the profit of the fortunate few who were handed good American dollars as
                            practically a free gift.</p>
                        <p>The second suggestion, the use of dollars to guaranty the Chinese
                            internal issue may be somewhat less subject to abuse but would I believe
                            be materially slower and technically more difficult. A plan of this type
                            might be put into effect by placing a part of the dollars available from
                            the credit in a special trust fund to be used for meeting <pb n="462"
                                xml:id="pg_462" facs="0472"/>the principal of Chinese internal bonds
                            at maturity. Such a fund might in the interim be invested in interest
                            bearing United States Government securities. Interest on the obligations
                            might be payable in yuan of a fixed amount or might be a variable amount
                            of yuan determined by the official rate between the dollar and the yuan.
                            Although I do not know how it would appeal to the Oriental mind
                            consideration might be given to the issuance of a Chinese security
                            comparable to United States Defense Bonds; that is a security which
                            would not bear coupon interest but which would sell at a discount from
                            the stated amount in dollars due so many years in the future.</p>
                        <p>Both of the foregoing have the objection that Chinese nationals will come
                            out of the war with several hundred millions of dollars of putative
                            claims against American goods, services or investments and these largely
                            in the hands of persons who are very probably on the whole rather
                            indifferent to the economic welfare of China. In as much, however, as it
                            is doubtless this class of Chinese who already possess the largest
                            amount of yuan, any plan involving the acquisition of yuan from the
                            public at large can hardly avoid this dilemma.</p>

                                might permit the Chinese to acquire currency from the public rather
                                than by adding to that already in circulation or (<hi rend="italic"

                                finance its expenditures. The first expedient has been suggested by
                                both Arthur Young and Sir Otto Niemeyer. Sir Otto mentioned the
                                matter to Mr. Cochran when the latter was in Chungking. Sir Otto
                                suggested the possibility of the Chinese Government issuing an
                                internal gold loan for a period of approximately fifteen years
                                secured <hi rend="italic">pro forma</hi> on customs revenue after

                                that he has already done so and Sir Frederick Phillips of the
                                British Treasury who is here in Washington has heard of it and has
                                mentioned it to Mr. Cochran. Apparently the scheme has not been
                                formulated in detail though perhaps this matter should be checked at
                                once with Phillips.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Young considered an expedient of this character at some length in
                                a memorandum which he submitted to Mr. Cochran. In his memorandum
                                Mr. Young contended that the issuance of foreign currency debt for
                                general subscription seemed out of the question since payment on
                                prewar foreign currency bonds was suspended early in 1939. Free
                                issuance of such bonds he believes would be contrary to sound credit
                                policy. He also argued that because of American freezing regulations
                                the public would be hesitant about buying foreign currency
                                obligations and that the issuance of such bonds might tend further
                                to hurt confidence in Chinese currency. For these reasons Mr. Young
                                considered more feasible some form of obligation repayable in
                                Chinese currency at a guaranteed rate of exchange. Thus, a bond for
                                one thousand yuan might be payable in Chinese currency at maturity
                                on the basis of exchange for United States fifty dollars with
                                interest payments based on the respective rates current when
                                interest is payable. Mr. Young recognized that in a situation such
                                as that occupied by China at present the official exchange rates
                                were likely to be much out of line with the internal purchasing
                                power of Chinese currency. He thought that to some degree this
                                situation could be safeguarded as to repayment of principal by
                                providing that it should be paid at a free market rate or if paid at
                                official rates these should bear a premium of a fixed percentage—say
                                20 per cent. A similar provision might apply to interest payments
                                with payment at a free market rate if any exists or if not payment
                                to be at some premium over the official rates. Mr. Young pointed out
                                that in the past the Chinese internal obligations had sold at a
                                yield of 12 to 13 per cent. He suggested that the bonds guaranteed
                                by the American and British Governments might be 6 per cent bonds
                                which he thinks could be issued at par.</p>
                            <p>It may be that some such expedient as this must be used and that the
                                matter should be explored with Treasury and with the British. I
                                understand, however, that the Treasury has traditionally been
                                opposed to guarantying the issues of a foreign government. It is
                                quite possible that the Treasury might be somewhat embarrassed by
                                having bonds which it guaranteed carry such a high rate of interest
                                as compared to domestic issues. On the other hand, it is possible
                                that <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0474"/>Chinese in Free China
                                would buy bonds at a lower rate of interest if the interest were
                                payable either in United States dollars or yuan at some premium
                                above the official rate. Although the dollars would be blocked over
                                here they would give a reasonable assurance of stability in value
                                and the Chinese Goverment might assure purchasers of the bonds that
                                their dollar funds could be held here indefinitely in the form of
                                bank deposits or United States investments.</p>
                            <p>In view of the difficulties which may be encountered in attempting to
                                work out a guaranteed loan, it is possible that primary
                                consideration should be given to the second alternative mentioned
                                above, namely the purchase of yuan by the Stabilization Board of
                                China. In view of present difficulties of shipping goods to China
                                which will probably become worse before they become any better the
                                earlier functions of the Board from the foreign exchange point of
                                view will doubtless be for some time to come comparatively
                                unimportant. Under these circumstances the Board might well divert a
                                large part of its attention to internal problems and be used as an
                                agency for supplying the Chinese Government with yuan which it has
                                purchased with dollars. A loan of this character could doubtless be
                                made from the Treasury Stabilization Fund without the additional
                                legislation that might be required in an operation such as the
                                guaranty of an internal loan issued by a foreign government.</p>
                            <p>Since few of the dollars sold could be used to purchase imports into
                                China it is probable that an expedient of this character would in
                                essence amount to countering the inflationary trend in China by
                                facilitating a flight of capital from that country. The success of
                                the operation would appear to depend in part upon the demand in
                                China for dollars which would be blocked under our freezing control.
                                It is possible, of course, that many Chinese might prefer to hold
                                blocked dollars rather than hoard commodities in China particularly
                                if the Chinese Government should concurrently undertake vigorous
                                action against the hoarding of commodities and speculation in
                                commodities. At the same time some consideration might be given to
                                the advisability of allowing some fluctation in the yuan-dollar rate
                                and some trading in dollars in an open market in Free China. This
                                might divert some of the speculative activity from commodities to
                                dollars. I should think it would be possible to limit any privileges
                                of this character to persons in Free China possibly by confining
                                them to operations effected through certain appointed banks.</p>
                            <p>It may be noted that Dr. Kung suggested to Mr. Cochran that the
                                United States Treasury set up in the United States a new and
                                separate fund in dollars to constitute a reserve backing for the
                                Chinese currency. Apparently the British Government would be asked
                                to set up a similar fund. Dr. Kung had not thought his plan out in
                                detail <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0475"/>but appeared anxious
                                that we let the world know and permit him to strengthen Chinese
                                confidence in the yuan through the knowledge of the existence of
                                such a fund. Kung apparently did not think it would be necessary to
                                utilize such sums but thought that the psychological effect would be
                                sufficient. It was not his idea that such funds should be turned
                                over to the Stabilization Board and used in the manner in which the
                                Board was at that time operating.</p>
                            <p>I am inclined to doubt that any mere psychological gesture of this
                                character would be effective. However, if Treasury should be
                                reluctant to the loan with the yuan purchase plan it might be
                                possible to combine the two by first trying Kung’s idea and by later
                                gradually beginning the purchase of yuan if the psychological effect
                                appears inadequate. The objection to such a compromise is that it
                                would do little to put the Chinese Government in immediate funds
                                without further resort to the printing press.</p>
                            <p>It should also be noted that the Department has just been informed
                                (telegram No. 548 from Chungking, December 30<note n="89"

                                Chiang has asked for a loan of one billion dollars from this country
                                and Great Britain. Apparently there is an intent of using this in
                                part in some unspecified way in connection with an internal bond
                                issue.</p>
                            <p>As pointed out above neither of the expedients suggested will be of
                                much assistance unless the National Government and note issuing
                                banks follow policies which do not negative the effect of United
                                States assistance. Both of these plans, of course, are also subject
                                to the objection that they may induce an influx of yuan from Hong
                                Kong, Shanghai and other areas of occupied China into Free China.
                                Such an influx can doubtless be engineered at any time by the
                                Japanese but so long as the price level in the interior is well
                                above that on the coast the influx will be not so easily effected as
                                if there were also a purely financial inducement operating. The
                                Japanese may, of course, demonetize the yuan in occupied China at
                                any time it suits their purposes. In the circumstances it would
                                appear desirable that China give immediate consideration to the
                                possibility of itself demonetizing national currency in circulation
                                in occupied China. There are, of course, considerable difficulties
                                in effecting such a plan. Presumably outstanding notes in occupied
                                China would have to be validated by some sort of a stamp which could
                                not be readily copied or counterfeited. Alternatively the old
                                currency would have to be exchanged for a new issue. In view of Sir
                                Otto’s suggestion that the National Government assume immediate
                                control over all bank notes and bank note paper in China,
                                replacement of old notes by a new issue might not be feasible. There
                                is also the further difficulty that demonetization of the yuan
                                currency in <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0476"/>occupied China
                                might cause serious losses both to the native population and to
                                foreign institutions and banks. Since the Chinese Government has
                                long resisted to the best of its ability the supplanting of the
                                national currency by currency issued by the invader and his puppets
                                such a move might be politically difficult to make. I believe,
                                however, that there are supposed to be some eight billions of yuan
                                in the Shanghai area. If this money should pour into Free China the
                                inflationary process would of course be greatly accelerated and this
                                danger may well outweigh other considerations.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I believe that all of
                            us who have been especially interested in meeting Chiang Kai-shek’s
                            request that this Government extend substantial financial aid to China
                            are warranted in feeling gratified at the unanimity and the speed with
                            which the Congress has made legislative provision for extending
                            financial aid to China in amount not to exceed $500,000,000. The
                            psychological effect produced, both in this country and in China and
                            elsewhere, by this Government’s action has been, I am confident, highly
                            beneficial to the common war effort of the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>It has occurred to me that further political advantage would be gained
                            were this Government to take prompt steps looking toward the formulating
                            of a proposal or proposals whereby there would be made immediately
                            available to the Chinese Government some substantial portion of this
                            money.</p>
                        <p>If this suggestion should appeal to you in principle, might I suggest
                            that there be held at the earliest practicable date a conference of
                            representatives of the interested agencies of this Government for the
                            purpose of working out what may seem to be the most feasible and
                            appropriate plan?</p>
                        <p>I am bringing the foregoing suggestions to your attention in view of this
                            Department’s continuing interest, which I am sure you appreciate and
                            share, in the political aspects of this matter.</p>

                        <p>123. Editorial reaction to [recent?] credits has been more appreciative
                            than enthusiastic. One leading paper advises that China should
                            demonstrate that she merits the credits by the use she makes of them in
                            strengthening her position and effectiveness as a partner in the United
                            [Nations] front, adding that if the loans are used to expand the
                            national budget or as reserves for issuing notes, then not only will
                            there be no benefit but there will be harm. Another paper cannot forego
                            the comment that the granting of such credits 4 years ago would have
                            prevented the present serious situation in the Far East. There is
                            general agreement that control of inflation with a view to reducing
                            commodity prices should be the primary objective. Uniformity is lacking
                            with regard to the precise means of accomplishing this end but the
                            absorption of idle capital through internal loans secured on the credits
                            is generally favored. Effective measures for price stabilization are
                            demanded and an acceleration of production of essential commodities is
                            advocated. Retrenchment to the point of deflation is urged by one paper
                            but others warn against such a policy, suggesting that the idle capital
                            absorbed should be used to encourage production.</p>
                        <p>Numerous proposals are being made in official and unofficial circles for
                            the use of the loans, including the following: (1) import of actual
                            United States currency for circulation in Free China; (2) unfreezing and
                            direct free sale of foreign exchange; (3) sale of American Government
                            bonds in China; (4) use for reconstruction projects as well as to
                            encourage domestic production; (5) use as currency reserve. These are
                            additional to the proposed sale of government bonds secured on foreign
                            currency credits in order to recapture substantial sums of Chinese
                            currency for government use.</p>
                        <p>Our information also indicates that China is going forward with proposals
                            for state monopolies of salt, tobacco, matches and sugar.<note n="90"

                            <p>Soon after my arrival in Delhi I received your most welcome message
                                informing me of the granting to China of the loan of $500,000,000. I
                                am most grateful to you for having accepted my suggestions in their
                                entirety and without any attached conditions. On behalf of the
                                Chinese Army and the Chinese People I wish to convey to you, and
                                through you to the Congress of the United States as well as the
                                American People, our deep gratitude for this timely assistance.</p>
                            <p>For four and a half years my people have suffered untold privations
                                and distress. This loan, which you have now secured for China, will
                                not only ameliorate the economic situation but will also raise the
                                morale of the people in the present struggle. The loans and
                                supplies, which we previously received from you, have enabled China
                                to continue our war of resistance up till now. Your new gesture in
                                granting us this timely assistance gives inspiration and
                                encouragement to all who are fighting for freedom during the
                                unprecedented crisis with which the world is faced.</p>
                            <p>Besides the meeting of military needs, the proceeds of the loan will
                                be used mainly for strengthening China’s economic structure,
                                redemption of legal tender notes, control of currency, stabilization
                                of prices and the promotion of war production.</p>
                            <p>I wish to reciprocate most heartily your greetings and good
                                wishes.</p>

                        <p>132. Embassy’s No. 123, February 14, 9 p.m. Several days ago the Ministry
                            of Finance convened an informal meeting of Chinese finance and banking
                            experts to discuss flotation of an internal bond issue secured from the
                            American and British credits. Niemeyer, Young and Adler<note n="92"
                                xml:id="d355fn92">Solomon Adler, Treasury Department representative
                                and acting alternate American member of the Chinese Stabilization
                                Board.</note> were also present. The discussion centered around four
                            main points: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The conversion rate between <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> and
                                    the dollar to be adopted in issuing bonds. Rates between five
                                    and six cents to the <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> were suggested,
                                    the latter being favored on the grounds that the higher rate
                                    would prove attractive and permit issuance at par. There was
                                    inconclusive discussion with regard to whether the bonds should
                                    bear on their face the dollar, as well as the <hi rend="italic"
                                        >fapi</hi> redemption value.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The rate of interest. Five and six per cent were mentioned,
                                    with the latter receiving principal support.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The amount of the first issue. A figure as high as
                                    5,000,000,000 <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> was suggested, but two
                                    and one-half million was favored, the idea being to follow a
                                    limited first issue immediately with a second issue, if the
                                    first issue was readily subscribed.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>The term of the bonds. The general feeling was that they
                                    should be short term—5 to 10 years. While no decisions were
                                    taken at the meeting, it is understood that the foregoing
                                    indicates along broad lines the general thought of the Ministry
                                    of Finance with regard to a bond issue. Suggestions with regard
                                    to lifting exchange restrictions, importing United States
                                    currency, and issuing new currency with dollar support met with
                                    no encouragement from Kung or from others present. There was no
                                    discussion at the meeting of possible other uses which might be
                                    made of the credits.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The degree of response which a dollar supported bond issue will meet
                            continue to be largely a matter of conjecture. There was talk at the
                            meeting of using various forms of compulsion if the response was
                            inadequate. Unless very carefully handled it is believed that the
                            adoption of such measures would prove to be unwise although the bonds
                            might be used to induce hoarders to disgorge their commodity holdings.
                            In implementing its avowed policy of agrarian reform, the Government
                            might advantageously use bonds to finance more equitable land
                            [distribution?] without increasing currency in circulation. The bonds
                            might also be utilized to encourage the responsible banks <pb n="470"
                                xml:id="pg_470" facs="0480"/>to be more generous and more effective
                            in their financing of production for immediate use and in making loans
                            to farmers for small scale land reclamation and improvement work.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Bell opened the meeting by stating to Dr. T. V. Soong that “we” had
                            been considering the question of a loan for an hour<note n="96"
                                xml:id="d357fn96">Department representatives not included.</note>
                            and “we” wondered whether the best procedure would not be to follow the
                            example of and act in the spirit of the Lease-Lend arrangements. Dr.
                            Soong said that he thought that would be best. Mr. Bell then asked Dr.
                            Soong if he (Dr. Soong) had come to any specific conclusions as to what
                            might be put in the agreement. Dr. Soong stated that he had not and
                            indicated that he would like to receive a draft of the proposals of the
                            United States Government. Mr. Bell then suggested that in the next few
                            days Dr. Soong might wish to be thinking over the matter of appropriate
                            terms for the agreement and Dr. Soong said that he would do so. Mr. Bell
                            thereupon indicated that the meeting was concluded. Everybody rose. Mr.
                            Bell indicated to the officers from the Department of State that he
                            wished we would remain behind. Dr. Soong moved to leave the room and
                            shook hands with several persons nearest him and made his exit, escorted
                            to the door by Mr. Hornbeck only.</p>
                        <p>2. Mr. Bell inquired whether the Department of State had any views
                            regarding the manner in which the loan funds might be made available to
                            China. He turned to Mr. Hornbeck.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck said that he had a suggestion, which he would put forward
                            purely as something to be discussed, a suggestion which would be
                            unofficial and personal, a suggestion which he had not yet discussed in
                            detail even with his own associates. He said that he felt that an
                            immediate objective should be to make available to China promptly and
                            “without strings” some part of the total sum. He would suggest for
                            consideration: make a straight loan of from $50,000,000 to $100,000,000,
                            at a low or no rate of interest, amortization to begin at some date
                            after the war is ended and to extend over a long period; arrange for
                            allocation of from $200,000,000 to $250,000,000 for broad purposes by
                            agreement; and leave the remainder for future consideration and disposal
                            as the situation unfolds and needs become apparent.</p>
                        <p>The Treasury officials, who had already discussed the matter at some
                            length among themselves, said that in their opinion it was politically
                            important to be able to say that the entire fund had been made
                            immediately available to China. They explained that they had in mind the
                            drafting of a very general loan agreement which would simply provide
                            that the funds are available to China and set forth the general
                            purposes—i.e., the furthering of the war effort—for which the loan is
                            being granted. In addition a memorandum might be handed to Dr. Soong
                            containing certain technical provisions as to interest (if any), methods
                            for setting up the bookkeeping arrangements involved, methods for
                            drawing on the fund by placing amounts in the Federal <pb n="472"
                                xml:id="pg_472" facs="0482"/>Reserve Bank, et cetera. The Treasury
                            representatives and Mr. Currie also stated that their opinion was that
                            there should be no attempt at this time to provide for the method of
                            repayment or adjustment of the loan.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the State Department expressed general agreement
                            with the Treasury approach particularly with reference to assuring China
                            that funds urgently needed could be obtained immediately and with
                            reference to the wisdom of not attempting at this time to settle the
                            terms of repayment or adjustment.</p>
                        <p>There then ensued some discussion as to what if any procedures might be
                            effective toward the end of ensuring that the loan funds are in fact
                            expended by China in such a way as to ensure maximum benefit to the war
                            effort. The discussion on this point was rather inconclusive. There was,
                            however, general agreement that it would be impossible to provide any
                            detailed assurances as to projects for which the funds would be
                            expended. Various of those present expressed views as to why it seemed
                            likely that China would wish to obtain American advice on this
                            expenditure. It was suggested that China will continue to need and to
                            hope for further American assistance and so would naturally wish to
                            satisfy the United States Government that these funds have been wisely
                            used. It was also suggested that in connection with the proposed loan
                            agreement Dr. Soong might address a letter to the Secretary of the
                            Treasury in which the Chinese Government would express a desire for the
                            collaboration and assistance of technical experts of the American
                            Government in working out plans for the use of the funds; this
                            suggestion was neither generally approved nor disapproved. It was also
                            suggested that the policy of not specifying the terms of repayment or
                            adjustment would also be likely to lead China to satisfy the United
                            States that the funds had not been wasted in order to ensure liberal
                            terms of repayment or adjustment. However, there was no detailed or
                            consistent analysis of procedures which would be relied upon to bring
                            about wise expenditure by China.</p>
                        <p>The Treasury officials had already informed Dr. Soong that they hoped to
                            have a draft proposal<note n="97" xml:id="d357fn97">For Initial Draft of
                                United States–China Financial Aid Agreement, handed to Mr. Soong by

                            or by Monday. Dr. Soong had said that he hoped the draft could be ready
                            by Saturday as he planned to go to Canada on Wednesday (February 25). At
                            the conclusion of the meeting the Treasury officials suggested that we
                            meet with them again at three o’clock on the following day (Friday,
                            February 20) at which time they hope to have some written proposals for
                            consideration.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>It has been wise and entirely appropriate for the United States to make
                            the full amount of the current loan to China available “without
                            strings”. Nonetheless, the United States has a very significant interest
                            in the uses to which this large loan is actually put.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, the whole concept of the relationships between the
                            United Nations is one of common effort toward a common goal. Joint
                            resources, military, economic and financial, are to be employed in such
                            a way as to obtain maximum benefit for the war effort. There is no
                            question but that in the use of any American military forces that may be
                            sent to China we will not hesitate to express our views as to the
                            purposes for which such forces should be used, whether the Allied
                            commander under whom they serve be American, or Chinese or some other
                            national. Indeed, it is to be assumed that we will not hesitate to make
                                <hi rend="italic">suggestions</hi> to the Chinese and to our other
                            Allies as to how we consider they might best employ their own military
                            forces. Consequently, it seems entirely appropriate that the United
                            States Government make <hi rend="italic">suggestions</hi> to the Chinese
                            Government as to what uses of the loan funds would in the opinion of the
                            Government of the United States be most beneficial to all concerned.</p>
                        <p>There is another persuasive reason for the United States to use its best
                            efforts and to endeavor to see that the loan funds are expended for
                            useful purposes. It cannot be too often recalled that the attitude of
                            the American people has as yet by no means become permanently one of
                            willingness to assume responsibilities abroad—one might say that this is
                            especially true with respect to the Far East. There is every reason to
                            assume that at some time in the not too distant future there will be a
                            considerable reaction in American public sentiment from the present
                            position of enthusiastic desire to cooperate with China. We have in the
                            past few days had evidence, in connection with our relations with Great
                            Britain, that even under present conditions there are important elements
                            of public opinion which are reluctant to see the United States undertake
                            necessary cooperation with other countries. [See in this connection the
                            attached copy of a press report of February 26<note n="99"

                            believe that the present loan, large though it is, does not represent
                            the last financial assistance which in our own interest, in China’s
                            interest and indeed in the interest of the Far East as a whole, it will
                            be wise for the United States to extend to China.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, it is believed that the current war efforts of the United
                            Nations and the interest of the United States and of China in
                            particular, both from an immediate and a long-range point of view, call
                            for such efforts as may be practical and appropriate on the part of the
                            United States to see that the funds made available to China are so
                            expended that they will obviate so far as possible criticism of the loan
                            and of our policy of giving full aid to China.</p>
                        <p>In this connection mention may be made of still another consideration.
                            The loan to China is believed to be without exact precedent in our
                            history. For the first time a substantial political loan has been made
                            by the United States without security, without interest, and without
                            retention of control by the United States of expenditure thereof. It is
                            not unlikely that other countries, particularly Latin American
                            countries, may, relying upon this precedent, ask for similar loans. It
                            would seem to be important that arrangements be worked out in connection
                            with the China loan which will give some measure of assurance that in
                            the expenditure thereof the United States will be consulted and
                            provision be made for careful and objective consideration of the
                            objectives for which the funds are expended.</p>
                        <p>For the foregoing reasons it is recommended that consideration be
                            promptly given to (1) establishing a procedure under which frank and
                            friendly discussion between the United States and China can be assured
                            with respect to the uses to which the loan will be put, and (2) the
                            drawing up of a list of those projects which the United States would be
                            prepared to recommend or suggest to China as desirable objectives in
                            expending the funds made available.</p>
                        <p>Consideration should be given to the question of whether the most
                            desirable and most practical procedure under the circumstances would be
                            the creation by China of some type of “board of review” or “planning
                            committee” composed of Chinese and American members (for example, the
                            present Chinese and American members of the Stabilization Board might
                            constitute such an agency). Perhaps it will be found that the only
                            feasible procedure would be frequent conferences and consultation
                            between Chinese and American representatives. This <pb n="475"
                                xml:id="pg_475" facs="0485"/>matter has been discussed with
                            representatives of the Treasury in a preliminary and inconclusive way.
                            It would seem desirable to take up the matter again in a more definitive
                            manner.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the question of possible projects which this Government
                            might wish to suggest or recommend to the Chinese Government, it would
                            seem that the Treasury Department would be the appropriate clearing
                            house and reviewing agency within this Government and that the
                            Department of State and other interested agencies should feel free to
                            call to the attention of the Treasury Department such projects as may
                            seem to them worthy of consideration. In this connection attention is
                            called to Mr. Gauss’s recent despatch<note n="3" xml:id="d358fn3">No.

                        <p>176. The Embassy has learned in strict confidence that the Ministry of
                            Finance has received from Washington and discussed a draft Sino-American
                            loan agreement. The Ministry is said to resent the provision for
                            consultation by the Chinese Government with the Treasury Department with
                            respect to expenditures under the loan on the grounds that a measure of
                            control is contemplated. It is disappointed to find that the loan is not
                            granted as an absolute gift in recognition of, as the press has stated,
                            China’s contribution to the general war effort.</p>
                        <p>Whether or not we should provide for some means of repayment is a
                            question of policy upon which I am not prepared to express an opinion.
                            One prominent and intelligent Chinese banker has stated privately that
                            the loan was obtained too easily to be appreciated or to insure
                            provision for its effective use. The Embassy can detect here an
                            assumption on the part of officials and bankers that the credit is a due
                            compensation to China for what the Chinese [regard as] our past and
                            present shortcomings and for China’s past and present resistance to
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>I am convinced that we should be firm in insisting upon retention of the
                            provision for consultation with the object of having some degree of
                            control over the manner in which the large loan is expended. As I have
                            verified in previous telegrams and in my despatch number <pb n="476"
                                xml:id="pg_476" facs="0486"/>266 of January 8, I am more of the
                            opinion that controls and allocation of portions of the loan for
                            specific purposes will prove to be in the best interests of China as
                            well as in our best interests.</p>

                            and discussed it briefly with him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Currie seemed to be in agreement with the views expressed in it. He
                            said that he did not think the term “board of review” would be a good
                            name to employ because it would imply too much in the way of veto power
                            or supervision. In general, he seemed to feel that we would have to rely
                            primarily upon consultation and said that he thought the most effective
                            consultation would have to take place in China.</p>
                        <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0487"/>
                        <p>He said that in addition to the points made in the memorandum as to why
                            the United States has a significant interest in the uses to which the
                            loan will be put, he considered it important to point out the necessity
                            that the executive report to Congress on the use made of these funds. He
                            remarked upon the fact that the loan had been consciously patterned
                            after the Lease-Lend operations. The Lease-Lend Act specifically
                            requires reports to Congress. He felt that as a practical matter the
                            executive could do no less in regard to the loan than it is required to
                            do in connection with operations under the Lease-Lend legislation. In
                            this same connection he said that all Lease-Lend requests are
                            individually scrutinized and passed upon by the United States
                            Government. The loan procedure which we envisage is, he said, certainly
                            far more liberal than the established Lease-Lend procedure.</p>
                        <p>I also showed a copy of the memorandum to Mr. Fox who expressed himself
                            as entirely in agreement with the points made in it. At his request I
                            let him have a copy for his own use and not for attribution.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Subject: Proposed Financial Agreement with China</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Government makes three substantive suggestions for changes in
                            the proposed agreement.</p>
                        <p>The first such change is that Article II be eliminated. This Article
                            contemplates that the Chinese Government will keep this Government
                            informed as to the use of the funds and will consult this Government
                            from time to time as to such usages.</p>
                        <p>The second change is the addition of the phrase “after the war”. This
                            change, if accepted, would definitely postpone the period for final
                            determination of the terms upon which aid is extended to China until
                            after the termination of hostilities.</p>
                        <p>The third change is that there be deleted from Article III the words
                            referring to interest charges. In this suggestion the Chinese Government
                            obviously has in mind eliminating any indication that the financial aid
                            extended by the Government of the United States will be repaid in
                            money.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the suggested elimination of Article II, it seems
                            desirable that there be kept in mind points as follows: <list>

                                <item>The Joint Resolution approved February 7 authorizes the
                                    Secretary of the Treasury “to loan or to extend credit or give
                                    other financial aid to China” and it would seem extremely
                                    doubtful that <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0488"/>the
                                    Congress intended that the executive branch of the Government
                                    should make an agreement which would discard at the outset and
                                    in entirety the words “to loan or to extend credit”;</item>

                                <item>Congress may be expected, as time goes by, to give
                                    increasingly careful scrutiny to reports of the ways in which
                                    the funds are expended;</item>

                                <item>Committees of Congress have already indicated in their

                                <item>The extension by the United States to China of financial aid
                                    is a cooperative enterprise to be regarded as an integral part
                                    of the common war effort of the two countries, and, as such,
                                    general consultation and the mutual offering of suggestions are
                                    normal, to be expected, and desirable;</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>)</label>
                                <item>The agreement with China will undoubtedly be looked to as a
                                    precedent in connection with proposals from other governments
                                    that similar financial aid be extended to them.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>With regard to the suggested addition of the phrase “after the war”,
                            there would seem to be no strong argument against such addition,
                            although it does leave the United States Government comparatively
                            empty-handed with respect to requiring the performance of “benefits to
                            be rendered”.</p>
                        <p>In considering the desire of the Chinese Government for the elimination
                            of mention of interest in the proposed agreement, the comment made under
                            subparagraph (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) above would seem to be
                            pertinent.</p>
                        <p>With the foregoing points in mind, it is recommended that it be suggested
                            to Dr. Soong that Article II be eliminated from the agreement; that the
                            first two sentences of the draft Article II be made the basis of an
                            exchange of notes between representatives of the two Governments to be
                            effected with conclusion of the agreement; and that, if the foregoing is
                            acceptable to the Chinese Government, the other changes suggested by the
                            Chinese Government be made.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that it might be pointed out to Dr. Soong that in
                            considering this whole matter this Government necessarily had to keep in
                            mind the various considerations listed on page two<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d361fn7">Paragraphs (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) through (<hi
                                    rend="italic">f</hi>).</note> and that we had given thought to
                            other ways of proceeding in the light of those considerations but had
                            discarded those other ways in the thought that they would not be so
                            acceptable to China as the way suggested in the tentative draft handed
                            to Dr. Soong. Dr. Soong might be told that among these other ways were
                            (1) the drafting of a normal credit or loan agreement, with provision
                            that no interest be paid and that payments of principal be made in
                            accordance with an agreed schedule and an agreed date for the beginning
                            of such payments; and (2) the <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0489"
                            />including in an agreement of a provision for the setting up by the
                            Chinese Government of some sort of a special body (possibly the Chinese
                            member and the American member of the Chinese Stabilization Board) on
                            which there would be one representative nominated by the Secretary of
                            the Treasury, which special body would be charged with approval under
                            the Chinese Government of projects for the use of the funds to be made
                            available by the Government of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Soong might be informed further that if the Chinese Government has
                            any suggestions which in its view would be preferable for meeting the
                            responsibilities which this Government has in connection with the
                            extension of the financial aid under reference to China, this Government
                            would welcome such suggestions.</p>

                        <p>154. Your 176, March 1, noon. Several days ago the Treasury Department
                            gave to T. V. Soong informally a draft of an agreement<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d362fn8">February 21, <hi rend="italic">United States
                                    Relations With China</hi>, p. 479.</note> whereunder the
                            $500,000,000 appropriated would be made available to the Chinese
                            Government, with an explanation that this was to be regarded as a
                            tentative draft presented to Soong for his consideration and with
                            invitation to him for his comments or suggestions. It was not intended
                            that Soong refer the draft to his Government before informing Treasury
                            officials, and through them State Department officials, of his reaction,
                            with suggestions, if any; and because of that, the Department did not
                            inform you by telegraph of the action taken.</p>
                        <p>Department suggests that, unless you perceive objection, you inform
                            appropriate high officials of the Chinese Government informally and in
                            confidence of the above.</p>
                        <p>Department, as the matter now stands, believes it desirable that you
                            refrain from being drawn into any discussion of terms or provisions of a
                            potential agreement regarding the funds; but, should you be drawn into
                            any discussion of the subject in general, you might to advantage point
                            out that in this country the authorities responsible in connection with
                            disposal and use of appropriated funds are under obligation to report
                            periodically upon the uses to which funds are put.</p>

                        <p>At the request of Under Secretary Bell of the Treasury Department there
                            was held this morning at 10:15 a meeting in Mr. Bell’s office in the
                            Treasury Department attended by those mentioned above to give
                            consideration to the comments made by Dr. Soong in his letter of March
                                3<note n="10" xml:id="d363fn10">See bracketed note, <ref
                                    target="#pg_476">p. 476</ref>.</note> on the draft of the
                            proposed loan agreement with China. (Mr. Hornbeck and Mr. Livesey were
                            unable to attend because of prior engagements.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bell opened the meeting by asking whether the State Department had
                            formulated views as to the procedure to follow in the light of the
                            comments made by the Chinese Government. Mr. Hamilton replied that Dr.
                            Soong’s letter had been read and studied only by the three officers
                            present from the State Department and by Mr. Hornbeck; that we had tried
                            to see Mr. Berle and Mr. Welles, but as yet we had not been able to
                            reach either; and that the Treasury Department had done such an
                            excellent piece of work in formulating the original draft that we
                            wondered whether they might not have some ideas as to what the best step
                            would be. Mr. Bell then commented that, while he had not yet consulted
                            the Secretary of the Treasury, it was Treasury’s thought that the best
                            thing to do would be to accept the proposition as put forth by Dr. Soong
                            in his letter of March 3. Mr. Hamilton then said that the responsibility
                            for making the decision was placed by the Joint Resolution upon the
                            Secretary of the Treasury, subject to the approval of the President, and
                            that any opinion expressed by the State Department would of course be
                            simply of an advisory character. Mr. Hamilton repeated that we had as
                            yet been unable to obtain the views of Mr. Berle and Mr. Welles. Mr.
                            Hamilton then gave a brief summary exposition of the views set forth in
                            the memorandum of March 6 on the subject “Proposed Financial Agreement
                                <pb n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0491"/>with China” and raised
                            expressly the question of endeavoring to effect an exchange of letters
                            with the Chinese representatives embodying the substance of article two
                            of the original draft of the proposed agreement. (Mr. Hamilton did not
                            exhibit the memorandum of March 6 and he did not leave a copy of it with
                            the Treasury Department.) Mr. Viner, Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Bell, and Mr.
                            Fox each expressed himself definitely as in favor of acceding to the
                            proposal put forth in Dr. Soong’s letter of March 3. Mr. Luthringer and
                            Mr. Hiss raised briefly certain considerations along the lines of the
                            comment made by Mr. Hamilton. However, in view of the very definite
                            indication that the Treasury Department desired to proceed as indicated
                            by Mr. Bell, the representatives from the State Department did not feel
                            that they should press the considerations which they had raised.</p>
                        <p>After the discussion was rather far advanced, it developed that Mr.
                            Bernstein had in mind the drafting of a letter to Dr. Soong in reply to
                            Dr. Soong’s letter of March 3 thereby taking cognizance (perhaps only by
                            implication) of the statements made in Dr. Soong’s letter, particularly
                            the statement to the effect that China in any case would like to keep
                            the Secretary of the Treasury informed. Mr. Bell said that he thought
                            that Mr. Bernstein’s idea would afford all the safeguard that would be
                            needed and wise to ask for under existing circumstances.</p>
                        <p>After a telephone conversation with Mr. Hornbeck, Mr. Hamilton said that
                            Mr. Hornbeck had suggested that we reach no definitive decision at the
                            meeting, but that the decision be left open pending reference of the
                            matter in so far as the State Department was concerned to Mr.
                            Welles.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bernstein undertook to complete the draft of a letter to Dr. Soong as
                            outlined in the last paragraph on page three of this memorandum and to
                            send it to the State Department today. Mr. Bell expressed the hope that
                            we could refer the matter promptly to Mr. Welles and get word back to
                            the Treasury Department by noon on Monday as to whether this Department
                            would be agreeable to proceeding as outlined by Mr. Bell. Mr. Hamilton
                            said that he thought that we would be able to get Mr. Welles’ views by
                            Monday noon. Mr. Fox mentioned that next Thursday, March 12, was a
                            Chinese holiday, it being one of the anniversaries connected with Sun
                            Yat Sen (the anniversary of Sun Yat Sen’s death), and Mr. Bell expressed
                            a desire to move forward as fast as possible in concluding an agreement.
                            He had previously mentioned the desirability, as he saw it, of
                            concluding the agreement next week.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bell said that Mr. Welles might possibly wish to speak directly to
                            Mr. Morgenthau in regard to the matter and he also raised <pb n="482"
                                xml:id="pg_482" facs="0492"/>the question whether it might not be
                            helpful possibly for Mr. Welles and Mr. Morgenthau to talk to Dr. Soong
                            and to point out orally to Dr. Soong in the most friendly manner that
                            this Government necessarily had responsibilities in regard to the
                            attitude of Congress, both at present and over the long swing, and in
                            reference to the question of there being established in the case of
                            China a precedent which would affect our relations with other
                            countries.</p>

                            for my comment in regard to the proposed agreement to extend financial
                            aid to China pursuant to Public Law 442, approved February 7, 1942,<note

                            primarily with you and the President. In my opinion, retention of
                            Article II of the draft originally presented to Dr. Soong or an exchange
                            of letters along the lines thereof would serve useful purposes both for
                            the Chinese Government and for this Government. I believe that such a
                            provision would be reflective of the cooperative spirit which underlies
                            the common war effort of the two countries and might be of some
                            assistance to the Chinese Government in resisting pressure from any
                            group in China which might advocate an unwise use of any part of the
                            funds made available.</p>
                        <p>Realizing that you have considered both the economic and the political
                            angles of the problem, I am prepared, in view of the opinion which you
                            have expressed orally that the adoption of the Chinese Government’s
                            suggestions would be satisfactory, to concur in the conclusions at which

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Welles</hi>: I have your letter of
                            March 9, 1942, in which you question the desirability of eliminating
                            Article II from the draft of the Agreement presented to Dr. T. V.
                            Soong.</p>
                        <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0493"/>
                        <p>I would welcome any provisions in the financial arrangement with China
                            which would protect the financial interests of the United States, as
                            well as promote the most effective economic use of the funds by the
                            Chinese. If there were not overbalancing political and military
                            considerations, I would insist upon the retention of Article II of the
                            original draft, and even inclusion of stronger provisions. But it has
                            always been agreed at meetings between State and Treasury Departments
                            that the purposes of the financial aid were predominantly political,
                            diplomatic, and military. These considerations therefore have determined
                            the formulation of the terms of the Agreement which was submitted to the
                            Chinese.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the first draft handed to the Chinese Government included
                            Article II calling for consultation and exchange of information.
                            However, in view of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek’s reactions to Article
                            II, and of his request that it be omitted, communicated to us in the
                            letter from Dr. T. V. Soong to this Department, the Treasury was
                            unwilling to risk jeopardizing the important political and military
                            value of this financial aid by insisting upon the retention of Article
                            II in the Agreement and therefore raised that question with the State
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>In light of the fact that the determination of the inclusion or the
                            exclusion of Article II turns almost wholly on questions of political
                            character, and in view of our telephone conversation of today, I should
                            like to have you advise me as to what our next step should be in
                            replying to the Generalissimo.</p>
                        <p>Since I feel that time is of the essence and that we should consummate
                            this Agreement without delay, I would appreciate an answer from you on
                            this matter as soon as possible.</p>

                        <p>My <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I refer to your letter
                            of March 10 on the subject of the draft of the proposed agreement
                            regarding the extension of financial aid to China.</p>
                        <p>All parties concerned are in agreement that the purposes of the extension
                            of this financial aid are predominantly political, diplomatic and
                            military.</p>
                        <p>The draft which you submitted to Dr. T. V. Soong for consideration
                            contains in its four articles provisions which make readily available to
                            the Chinese Government without restrictive commitments the <pb n="484"
                                xml:id="pg_484" facs="0494"/>$500,000,000 which the Congress
                            appropriated for the making of a loan, the extending of a credit or the
                            giving of other financial aid to China. It does not in fact impair or
                            restrict the Chinese Government’s freedom of action in the making of
                            disbursements.</p>
                        <p>In his letter to Mr. Bell of March 3 Dr. Soong suggests, on behalf of
                            Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the making of a number of changes. In my
                            opinion, we can readily accept most of these suggestions and proceed
                            accordingly. With regard, however, to the suggestion that Article II be
                            omitted in its entirety, it seems to me that there is ample warrant for
                            a discussion of the matter and that we should endeavor to cause Dr.
                            Soong and the Generalissimo to realize that provisions such as appear in
                            the draft of that article are desirable from point of view not only of
                            this Government but of the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>With regard to procedure, I would suggest that there first be made a
                            redraft of the proposed Article II and that there then be communicated
                            to Dr. Soong a statement by you that we are in complete concurrence with
                            his comments and the changes which he has suggested except as regards
                            that article, and that, in the light of his comments on that article,
                            there is submitted to him for his consideration a possible alternative
                            form.</p>
                        <p>Toward facilitating procedure along that line, I submit here attached for
                            your consideration a draft of a possible substitute for Article II.</p>
                        <p>Another possible line of procedure which might be considered would be
                            that of putting the substance of this suggested alternative draft of
                            Article II into letters which might be exchanged between you and Dr.
                            Soong.</p>
                        <p>In as much as the only delay which has occurred in connection with the
                            attention which has been given this matter has been delay on the part of
                            the Chinese, I would further suggest that, in whatever communication you
                            make to Dr. Soong, you indicate to him that all officers of this
                            Government who are concerned with the negotiating of this agreement are
                            eager to bring the matter to a mutually satisfactory conclusion with the
                            utmost possible expedition.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Bell of the Treasury Department telephoned at four this afternoon. He
                            said that he had tried to get in touch with Dr. T. V. Soong, but that
                            Dr. Soong had not been able to see him today because he (Dr. Soong) had
                            to go to New York to see a doctor. Mr. Bell said that Mr. Fox was also
                            going to New York today and that in the circumstances, in order to avoid
                            any appearance of delay on our part, Mr. Bell had asked Mr. Fox to call
                            on Dr. Soong tomorrow in New York, to inform Dr. Soong that we had
                            accepted all the other suggestions made by Dr. Soong, and to hand Dr.
                            Soong for study and consideration the revised draft of Article II which
                            was forwarded to the Treasury Department by this Department in Mr.
                            Welles’ letter to Mr. Morgenthau of March 11. Mr. Bell said that Mr. Fox
                            was to suggest to Dr. Soong that Dr. Soong think over this possible new
                            draft of Article II until his return to Washington when he could give
                            the Treasury Department his reaction thereto. Mr. Bell said that Dr.
                            Soong might of course do what he had done with the previous draft and
                            simply refer the revised draft of Article II to his Government by
                            telegraph. Mr. Bell said also that in case Dr. Soong returned to
                            Washington by Saturday morning we might be able to have another meeting
                            on the matter Saturday morning.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Bell</hi>: Confirming our conversation, I
                            have to inform you that I have received a reply from the Generalissimo
                            with reference to your proposal to re-insert Article II of the proposed
                            loan agreement in a modified form.</p>
                        <p>The Generalissimo states that after carefully consulting his colleagues
                            he feels that even in the modified form Article II is generally
                            construed as limiting the freedom of action in the use of the proceeds,
                            and would therefore adversely affect the public response to bonds,
                            savings deposits and other measures that are to be based on the
                            loan.</p>
                        <p>In addition, among his soldiers, who have been tremendously heartened by
                            the generous and unconditional assistance as revealed in the exchange of
                            messages between the President and himself, the inclusion of Article II
                            would create the impression that the terms are not as clear-cut as they
                            envisaged.</p>
                        <p>The Generalissimo therefore feels that the civilian and military
                            reactions are such as to justify his request that Article II be dropped
                            completely, and I shall be grateful if you will transmit his message to
                            your colleagues for their consideration.</p>

                        <p>Reference, Dr. T. V. Soong’s letter of March 19 to the Under Secretary of
                            the Treasury, Mr. Bell, regarding the draft, in modified form, of
                            Article II of the proposed loan agreement.</p>
                        <p>My surmise is that the Generalissimo is taking his position upon
                            recommendation made to him by advisers (Chinese) who are making of this
                            a political poker game; that they are trying to force the United States
                            Government into a position assumption of which by it will not <pb

                            $500,000,000 “without strings” but will score for them a first-class
                            diplomatic victory the consequences of which in the long run will be
                            good neither for this country nor for China.</p>
                        <p>Chiang Kai-shek first asked, in December, for a <hi rend="italic"
                                >loan</hi>. Now it would appear that he is asking for a <hi
                                rend="italic">gift</hi>. This is, in my conjecture, a product of
                            clever maneuvering on the part of his advisers.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Gauss, on December 30, 1941, in telegram 548, December 30, 6

                            General Chiang had sent for him on that day and, after reviewing recent
                            measures for military and political collaboration with the United States
                            and Great Britain, had stated that America and Britain must help China
                            financially. Mr. Gauss said, “he wants a credit of about $1,000,000,000
                            American dollars”; he has asked the British Government to provide about
                            half of this; he said that the proposed loan would be used partially for
                            a domestic bond issue designed to curb inflation. “The Generalissimo
                            stated that plans for the use of the proposed loan or credit were being
                            worked out by experts and advisers but meanwhile he desired me to make
                            the proposal to my Government and when the loan is assured the proposals
                            for its application can be put forward.”</p>
                        <p>On January 9, Mr. Fox telegraphed the Secretary of the Treasury
                            (Chungking’s 29, January 9, 2 p.m.) transmitting a message from Dr.
                            Kung. Kung stated that China had been fighting for four and a half years
                            with untold sacrifices and heavy strain on her resources; her financial
                            and economic situation was now in precarious state; it was necessary to
                            keep control of prices and currency without curtailing production; “if
                            financial and economic front, already very critical, should collapse,
                            impossible to carry on war”; “therefore, I appeal to you for a
                            $500,000,000 political war loan”.</p>
                        <p>On January 9 Mr. Fox telegraphed the Secretary of the Treasury
                            (Chungking’s 30, January 9, 3 p.m.). <hi rend="italic">Inter alia</hi>,
                            he said: “If impracticable to tie up Stabilization Board with loan could
                            American representation be provided not as a protection for the United
                            States but in order to make certain that most effective use would be
                            made of funds in strengthening financial and economic structure of
                            China?”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gauss, on March 1, 1942, in telegram 176, March 1, noon, states that
                            he has learned in strict confidence that the Ministry of Finance had
                            received from Washington a draft of a Sino-American loan agreement. He
                            had been told that the Ministry of Finance resented the provision for
                            consultation and that it was “disappointed to find that the loan is not
                            granted as an absolute gift in recognition of …<note n="15"
                                xml:id="d370fn15">Omission indicated in the original.</note>
                            <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0498"/>China’s contribution to the
                            general war effort.” “One prominent and intelligent Chinese banker has
                            stated privately that the loan was obtained too easily to be appreciated
                            or to insure provision for its effective use.” In conclusion, Mr. Gauss
                            says: “I am convinced that we should be firm in insisting upon retention
                            of the provision for consultation with the object of having some degree
                            of control over the manner in which the large loan is expended. As I
                            have verified in previous telegrams and in my despatch number 266 of
                            January 8, I am more of the opinion that controls and allocation of
                            portions of the loan for specific purposes will prove to be in the best
                            interests of China as well as in our best interests.”</p>
                        <p>The matter has gone so far (and so) that I must confess I am at a loss
                            for an idea of anything to do that would put this Government in what I
                            would regard as a satisfactory position. As a possible alternative to
                            complete capitulation, we <hi rend="italic">might</hi> turn the tables
                            by taking a position that, in as much as the Congressional authorization
                            provides for “a loan, a credit or other financial aid”, we are not
                            prepared to make an unconditional gift in the amount of $500,000,000 but
                            would be willing to enter upon an agreement for making $<hi
                                rend="italic">X</hi> available on the terms which China demands,
                            leaving the remainder of the $500,000,000 for future consideration on
                            the basis of a loan or a credit. Should it be decided that the Chinese
                            demand must be acceded to, it is believed that consideration should be
                            given to the possible desirability of consulting the chairmen of certain
                            Congressional committees before casting the die.</p>

                        <p>The Foreign Minister of China, Dr. T. V. Soong, called to see me this
                            morning at my request.</p>
                        <p>I told Dr. Soong that after the conversation of the President with the
                            Secretary of the Treasury I had asked him to be kind enough to come to
                            see me in order that I might talk over with him certain problems which
                            would arise in the event that the purport of Article 2 of the agreement
                            which had been drafted for signature by him and by Secretary Morgenthau
                            covering financial assistance by the United States to China in the sum
                            of 500 millions of dollars were omitted.</p>
                        <p>I said that of course the action of the Congress and the Executive of the
                            United States in granting financial aid to China to the extent of half a
                            billion dollars indicated our full confidence in the Chinese Government
                            and the extent of the desire of the United States to assist <pb n="489"
                                xml:id="pg_489" facs="0499"/>China in our common war effort. I said
                            that, however, sooner or later there would be an insistent demand in the
                            United States on the part of our own people for information as to how
                            this assistance rendered by us had in reality aided the Chinese
                            Government and people in the common war effort and that if there were no
                            provision included in the record of the agreement and of the negotiation
                            which led up to it under which the Chinese Government was to furnish
                            this Government with full information as to the manner in which these
                            funds had been expended, a situation would inevitably arise which would
                            be detrimental to the best interests of both countries and to the
                            relations between them.</p>
                        <p>I said that I fully understood, in view of the Generalissimo’s message to
                            the President, that the Chinese Government interpreted this assistance
                            as being “without any conditions attached”. I was therefore not
                            suggesting any reconsideration of this aspect of the matter, but I
                            wondered if Dr. Soong would not agree for the reasons I had mentioned
                            that a unilateral statement on the part of the Chinese Government to
                            this Government that in view of this cooperation which so happily
                            existed between our two countries, it intended to inform the Secretary
                            of the Treasury of the United States fully from time to time of the
                            disposition which had been made of these funds would not be a desirable
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Soong immediately stated that he would be very glad indeed to have
                            this done and that if I agreed, he would immediately address in the name
                            of his Government a letter in that sense to the Secretary of the
                            Treasury.</p>
                        <p>I expressed my appreciation of his friendly and cooperative attitude and
                            said I thought this would indeed be exactly the procedure which would
                            settle the matter satisfactorily. I said that if this step were now
                            taken, I felt sure that the agreement could immediately be
                            concluded.</p>

                        <p>206. Please inform Dr. H. H. Kung, Minister of Finance that the following
                            letter to him from Henry Morgenthau, Jr., Secretary of the Treasury, is
                            being mailed today.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Dear Dr. Kung: I would like to take this occasion on the conclusion
                                of our negotiations on financial aid to China to express my
                                appreciation of the cooperative and understanding spirit which you
                                and the other members of the Government of China have always brought
                                to discussions with me and my Government.</p>
                            <p>The peoples of the United Nations have benefited from the indomitable
                                will shown by the Government of China and its valiant leader,
                                Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, to fight on until the last Japanese
                                soldier has been driven back into the sea and the evil forces of
                                Japanese militarism destroyed.</p>
                            <p>The financial assistance being given by the United States to China
                                illustrates to the entire world the good faith and determination of
                                the United Nations when they pledged themselves to pool their
                                resources to defeat the common enemy. Of equal importance it is an
                                expression of the faith and confidence which the American people
                                have in their comrades-in-arms—the Chinese people and their
                                leaders.</p>
                            <p>The fulfillment of the purposes of the Agreement will greatly
                                strengthen China’s ability to continue its successful resistance.
                                The past splendid record of the Government of China in adhering to
                                the aims and intent of Agreements entered into with the U.S.
                                Treasury give me absolute confidence that the carrying out of the
                                Agreement will be to the mutual satisfaction of both countries.</p>

                                Premier).</note> and concurrently Minister of Finance, has asked the
                            Embassy to transmit the following telegrams each dated March 24:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>Number 1. To the President: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“In conclusion of the five hundred million dollar loan
                                        agreement, I wish to express on behalf of the Chinese
                                        Government and people my deep appreciation of America’s
                                        readiness in answering our call for financial aid. The
                                        consummation of the loan is a glorious tribute to America’s
                                        sympathetic and generous understanding of China’s needs and
                                        a magnificent manifestation of the spirit of the Atlantic
                                        Charter. The speed with which the loan was adopted is the
                                        best answer to critics who consider democratic governments
                                        incapable of quick action. America’s contributions to
                                        China’s war chest, I am sure, will greatly invigorate
                                        China’s internal economy and strengthen her war efforts,
                                        thereby hastening the common victory of free peoples over
                                        aggression. The Chinese people will always remember your
                                        leadership in bringing about this timely support for our
                                        common cause.”</p>

                                        to China. We remember the assistance you were so largely
                                        instrumental in giving us in the past when we were resisting
                                        aggression single-handed. Recent events have fully
                                        vindicated your foresight and [apparent omission]. I am sure
                                        America’s contributions to China’s war chest will greatly
                                        invigorate our internal economy and strengthen our war
                                        efforts, thereby hastening the inevitable defeat of our

                                <p>“I have received and I thank you for your message of March 24,
                                    telegraphed through Ambassador Gauss, in regard to the
                                    conclusion of the agreement extending $500,000,000 of financial
                                    aid to China. I am glad indeed that, in times which call for
                                    forthright and prompt action, our two Governments have been able
                                    to consummate expeditiously a negotiation of such importance;
                                    and I am confident that the beneficial results of our
                                    cooperative effort toward a common end will measure up to the
                                    expectations of the Government and people of China as well as
                                    those of the Government and people of the United States.”</p>

                        <p>On March 19, Mr. Hornbeck, Mr. Livesey, Mr. Luthringer and myself
                            attended a meeting in Mr. Bell’s office at the Treasury Department <pb
                                n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0503"/>to consider further the
                            question of financial assistance to China in the light of Dr. T. V.
                            Soong’s letter of March 19 to Mr. Bell in which Dr. Soong stated that
                            General Chiang Kai-shek felt that Article II of the proposed agreement,
                            even in the modified form suggested, would be objectionable and General
                            Chiang requested therefore that that Article be dropped completely.
                            Representatives of the Treasury Department present at the conference
                            were Mr. Bell, Mr. White, Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Southard, Mr. Friedman, Mr.
                            Viner and Mr. Fox.</p>
                        <p>At the request of Mr. Bell, Mr. Hornbeck explained the view of the
                            Department of State. (Prior to attending the conference, Mr. Hornbeck,
                            Mr. Livesey and Mr. Hamilton had discussed the matter briefly with Mr.
                            Welles who asked that we endeavor to seek the agreement of the Treasury
                            Department to try to get the Chinese to agree to include the substance
                            of Article II (relating to exchange of information and consultation as
                            to use of the funds) in an exchange of letters.) Mr. Hornbeck said that
                            under instruction he wished to suggest that we endeavor to obtain
                            Chinese agreement to an exchange of letters which would incorporate the
                            substance of Article II. Mr. Hornbeck gave reasons in support of this
                            suggestion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bell said that the Secretary of the Treasury was inclined, unless the
                            Department of State perceived objection, to agreeing to the Chinese
                            request and concluding the agreement with the omission entirely of
                            Article II. Various representatives of the Treasury Department expressed
                            comment, all in favor of accepting the Chinese proposal <hi
                                rend="italic">in toto</hi>. Some of the points which the Treasury
                            representatives brought out were that the exchange of messages between
                            the President and Chiang Kai-shek, in which Chiang Kai-shek asked for
                            financial aid without any conditions attached, had set the framework for
                            any agreement; that we should treat China with full confidence; and that
                            with every exchange of communications and the rejection by China of
                            ideas put forward by this Government the situation became progressively
                            worse and the position of this Government less strong. After
                            considerably more than an hour of discussion back and forth, Mr.
                            Hornbeck suggested that Mr. Viner and Mr. Hamilton draft a possible
                            exchange of letters. The meeting adjourned on the understanding that Mr.
                            Viner and Mr. Hamilton would prepare such a draft, but on the
                            understanding also that the idea of an exchange of letters had not been
                            accepted by those present at the meeting. Mr. Bell expressed the view
                            that it might be well for Mr. Morgenthau and Mr. Welles to discuss the
                            question with the President or for the question to be brought up at the
                            Cabinet meeting the next day, March 20.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Viner and Mr. Hamilton prepared two alternative sets of a possible
                            exchange of letters. Copies are attached.<note n="20" xml:id="d378fn20"

                        <p>On the morning of March 20 FE prepared a redraft, based on the
                            Viner-Hamilton drafts, of a possible exchange of letters. A copy of this
                            redraft is attached.<note n="21" xml:id="d378fn21">Not printed.</note>
                            Mr. Hornbeck and Mr. Hamilton reported to Mr. Welles orally what had
                            transpired at the meeting at the Treasury Department the previous
                            afternoon and showed Mr. Welles the draft of a possible exchange of
                            letters. Mr. Welles said that he would be prepared to discuss the matter
                            at the Cabinet meeting that afternoon.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the discussion at the Cabinet meeting, the President
                            directed Mr. Welles to speak to Dr. Soong. (See memorandum of
                            conversation of March 21 between Mr. Welles and Dr. Soong.)</p>

                        <p>Both articles express the fear that the additional credit made available
                            by the intended domestic bond issues based on the loan may, unless more
                            careful restrictions are imposed, have an inflationary effect opposite
                            to that sought. In this they reflect a prevalent lack of confidence in
                            the government’s fiscal policy. But from this point the viewpoints of
                            the two papers diverge. The <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi>,
                            consistent with its long advocated policy which it calls “deflation”,
                            lays the main emphasis on the monetary side of the problem, pointing out
                            the dangers involved in considering the loan, and that from Great
                            Britain, as a “reserve” for the Chinese currency, which although already
                            greatly over-expanded hardly equals their face amount. In addition this
                            paper believes that subscription to the proposed bonds by the well-to-do
                            will have to be put on a compulsory basis, that the problem of hoarding
                            should be attacked by the forced sale of hoarded stocks in exchange for
                            bonds, and that use of the loan for stimulation of production must be
                            most carefully controlled in order to avoid further inflationary
                            effects. The <hi rend="italic">Hsin Hua Jih Pao</hi>, on the other hand,
                            believes that the question must be approached on a broader basis and
                            that every possible means must be found to attack inflation and
                            eliminate hoarding by increasing domestic production. It inferentially
                            criticizes the sale of bonds redeemable in foreign currency as
                            permitting the flight abroad of capital which would better be used in
                            developing this domestic production. It is interesting to note that this
                            paper, Communist in support, is the only one to insist that China should
                            repay the loan.</p>

                        <p>34. Learning from the American Acting Associate Director General of the
                            Chinese Salt Administration that a Government salt monopoly was to be
                            established effective January 1 and that he had been informed by the
                            Chinese Director General that it was proposed to reduce the status of
                            foreign officers of the Administration from their <pb n="496"
                                xml:id="pg_496" facs="0506"/>existing equal authority and joint
                            responsibility with their Chinese colleagues to that of advisors, I made
                            informal inquiry on the subject of the Minister of Finance<note n="23"
                                xml:id="d380fn23">H. H. Kung.</note> and was informed in reply that
                            the monopoly would become effective from January 1 and “will not affect
                            foreign loans originally secured on salt tax” and that “elective staff
                            members who have been giving satisfactory service and who are technical
                            experts will continue to be employed”.</p>
                        <p>As China, according to my understanding, gave assurances to British and I
                            believe American interests having loans secured on the salt revenues
                            that China contemplated no material alteration in the existing form of
                            the Salt Administration resulting in [change of?] status of foreign
                            employees, the action of the Minister of Finance raises a question of
                            good faith, and, in addition, of heavy capital outlay to organize this
                            Government monopoly at a time when the Government financial position is
                            disorganized and currency inflation almost beyond control.</p>

                                >Not printed.</note> regarding Chinese monopolies. Learning that the
                            Minister of Finance, despite contrary counsel of government advisers, is
                            [proceeding] with his plans for monopolies reforming [<hi rend="italic"
                                >sic</hi>] a salt monopoly was actually being established effective
                            January 1, I approached the Minister of Finance informally for
                            information regarding a reported tobacco monopoly, expressing the
                            concern of American leaf and other tobacco interests. He replied that
                            monopoly of sale of cigarettes is being planned but it has not yet
                            completed the legislative procedure and that all Chinese and foreign
                            cigarette merchants are enjoying the same treatment in regard to tax
                            laws and that there is no discrimination.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as the institution of monopolies will require heavy financial
                            outlay, I have little doubt that the monopoly plans of the Minister of
                            Finance are actually related to the loan which China hopes to obtain
                            from the United States and Britain. It seems to me that the opportunity
                            is now presented if we propose to entertain the Chinese request for

                            January 12, 4 p.m., in regard to plans for the establishment of salt,
                            tobacco and other government monopolies in China.</p>
                        <p>It appears from the telegrams under reference that the Chinese Government
                            plans to proceed with the establishment of a government salt monopoly,
                            effective January 1, and that plans are being made, though not so far
                            advanced, for a cigarette monopoly.</p>
                        <p>The Department has been aware for more than a year that the Chinese
                            Minister of Finance was making plans to establish various government
                            monopolies. Early in the year 1941, Mr. O. C. Lockhart, Associate
                            Director General of the Chinese Government Salt Administration,
                            furnished the Department with detailed plans for the creation of a salt
                            monopoly. According to these plans the establishment of this monopoly
                            would require an outlay of $1,500,000,000 (Chinese currency) to be
                            financed by “loans” from the four government banks. It was fairly clear
                            that new currency would have to be issued for the purpose at a time when
                            China’s currency inflation was almost getting out of control. (At the
                            present time the sum required would probably be two or three times the
                            earlier estimate). Moreover the establishment of monopoly would oblige
                            the government to incur vast new transport problems at a time when the
                            government is having great difficulty in meeting its existing transport
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>The Department did not take any action in regard to the proposed salt
                            monopoly, as the establishment of the monopoly seemed at that time not
                            to be a matter of imminence. However, the Department’s objections and
                            opposition to the establishment of such a monopoly were made known to
                            Ambassador Gauss in March 1941, prior to his departure for Chungking.
                            Subsequently on July 4, 1941 the Department instructed Ambassador
                                Gauss,<note n="26" xml:id="d382fn26">Telegram No. 131, July 4, 1941,
                                2 p.m., not printed.</note> at a time when the establishment of a
                            tobacco monopoly seemed to be in process of being established in China,

                            tobacco monopoly, to express this Government’s disapprobation of
                            restrictive monopolies in general, and to point out <pb n="498"
                                xml:id="pg_498" facs="0508"/>the inflationary effects which
                            arrangements for the financing of a tobacco monopoly in China would have

                        <p>There is now under consideration the question of the extension of a

                            question should not be made a condition of such a loan, FE<note n="27"
                                xml:id="d382fn27">Division of Far Eastern Affairs.</note> considers
                            that opportunity might be taken by officers of this Department, and
                            perhaps also of the Treasury Department, to point out informally to
                            appropriate Chinese officials that the establishment of these monopolies
                            in China at this time would seriously aggravate a situation which the
                            contemplated loan would be designed at least in part to remedy. It could
                            be suggested to the Chinese officials that, in view of the probable

                            meeting on March 3 Bank of England cabled him that after furnishing
                            board with pounds sterling 750,000 to meet sterling requirements since
                            outbreak of Pacific War it need presumably expect no further calls from
                            board in view of changed situation and pound sterling 50 million loan.
                            Hall-Patch therefore inclined to favor suspension of board operations
                            but yielded to consensus of meeting including chairman which was
                            strongly opposed.</p>
                        <p>Suspension of board operations at this time would be very unfortunate. It
                            would emphasize China’s isolation, further weaken American and British
                            prestige and influence here and would be welcomed by certain groups in
                            Chinese Government. It would be difficult for board to resume operations
                            once suspended. There is still some commercial cargo in Wanting and
                            Lashio, import of which board should finance, and trickle of goods is
                            expected from Burma and India over existing mule track even before

                            may provide convenient instrument for use of loan because of confidence

                        <p>215. TF–20. For Fox care of Secretary of the Treasury from Adler.</p>
                        <p>1. Chinese board members report informally that Doctor Kung called a
                            meeting of Chinese board members and financial and banking experts on
                            March 9.</p>
                        <p>He said that T. V. Soong<note n="31" xml:id="d384fn31">Chinese Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs.</note> had recommended the following on New
                            York bankers’ advice: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) lowering exchange rate
                            to 4 cents, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) using loan to guarantee and
                            thereby encourage new savings deposits with Chinese banks, (<hi
                                rend="italic">c</hi>) these savings deposits to be redeemable in
                            foreign exchange for about 1, 2 and 3 years and (<hi rend="italic"
                                >d</hi>) possibility of using Stabilization Board as instrumentality
                            with respect to (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) and (<hi rend="italic"
                            >c</hi>).</p>
                        <p>With respect to (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), Doctor Kung felt the
                            reduction would be too precipitous and was more disposed to accept a
                            5-cent rate. He is also inclined towards using differential exchange
                            rates in connection with proposed dollar backed issues. The whole
                            discussion at meeting was tentative and nothing definite emerged.</p>
                        <p>2. Dr. Kung told meeting Generalissimo<note n="32" xml:id="d384fn32"
                                >Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Chinese Executive Yuan
                                (Premier).</note> wanted to have a stock market in Chinese
                            Government securities opened in Chungking, adding that if a stock market
                            is developed it should if it is possible include a market in grain
                            futures.</p>
                        <p>3. Minister of Food, head of Bank of Communications, and newly appointed
                            [General?] Secretary of Central Bank argued strongly at meeting for
                            unfreezing Chinese assets in the United States and for restoring free
                            exchange market here, but Dr. Kung opposed these suggestions.</p>

                        <p>244. From Adler for Fox, care Secretary of the Treasury:</p>
                        <p>“No. 22. 1. Y. C. Koo<note n="34" xml:id="d385fn34">Chinese Vice Minister
                                of Finance.</note> informed me on March 17 that Ministry of Finance
                            has been placed in embarrassing position as a result of public criticism
                            of Ministry for not having revealed its plans for use of loan. Moreover,
                            adoption of agreement in final form may take some time, and there is
                            urgent need for some Government action to deal with deteriorating
                            economic situation here. Ministry has hopes for going ahead on its plans
                            for as long as possible, but it must obtain governmental indorsement for
                            them and make necessary preparations for their execution. Therefore
                            Ministry hopes plans now being formulated for new Chinese Government
                            flotations native backing of part of United States loan will not be
                            misunderstood by Treasury. Such action, he assured me, is in no way
                            intended to violate the spirit of cooperation existing between the two
                            Allies nor to obviate discussion on best methods of using loan.</p>
                        <p>2. Ministry of Finance is now pushing for adoption of following measures: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Flotation of a United States dollar-backed bond issue with a
                                    10-year maturity, paying 4 percent per annum, and to be
                                    redeemable in United States dollars. [It?] asserts the Executive
                                    Yuan has already endorsed this measure, but it has not yet been
                                    decided whether to give designated purchases a bonus by a flat
                                    discount in purchase price of bond or by selling bonds at an
                                    exchange rate more favorable than official rate. This measure
                                    has to go before Supreme Defense Council and its subcommittee on
                                    finance, and also the Legislative Yuan for ratification. Sale of
                                    bonds would probably not start before May.</item>

                            </note> received from his Minister of Finance stating that the Universal
                            Trading Corporation of New York had been instructed to complete in full
                            the repayment of the Wood Oil Loan of February 8, 1939, although full
                            liquidation was not required, under the terms of the contracts, until
                            1944.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stressed the fact that the funds utilized in the repayment
                            of this loan had come solely from funds derived from the tung oil
                            contracts themselves.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador spoke with great feeling of the fact that this loan, which
                            was now repaid, had come at the darkest moment in the history of the
                            Chinese struggle against Japan, right after the evacuation of Hankow by
                            the Chinese forces, and that the effect of the loan had been tremendous
                            and stimulating to the resistance of the Chinese people.</p>

                        <p>235. Reference question of state monopolies of salt, tobacco, matches and
                            sugar in China.</p>
                        <p>For your information the Department has prepared a brief memorandum<note
                                n="40" xml:id="d388fn40">Not printed.</note> in regard to the
                            question of monopolies in China for possible use by concerned American
                            officials in conversations here with representatives of the Chinese
                            Government. There is pointed out in the memorandum the inevitable
                            inflationary effect of the large expenditures that would be required for
                            the purchase of properties and stocks and of the setting up of machinery
                            necessary for the financing and functioning of monopolies at a time when
                            every effort is being made to extend to China assistance in curbing
                            inflation. There is also mentioned the fact that the use by China either
                            directly or indirectly of any part of American credits for the
                            establishment of a government monopoly in China covering a commodity
                            prominent in the economy and export trade of the United States might
                            cause embarrassment to the Government of the United States. In this
                            connection it is stated that the experience of American leaf tobacco
                            producers and exporters was that government monopolies inevitably tended
                            to restrict imports and that such American leaf tobacco producers and
                            exporters would be quick to criticize the Government of the United
                            States if credits made available by it to China were used, directly or
                            indirectly, in a manner resulting in increased restrictions on the
                            exports of American tobacco to China. It is pointed out that such
                            criticism would tend to place difficulties in the way of continuance of
                            assistance by the United States to China in further constructive,
                            possibly post-war, work. It is also pointed out that aside from the
                            question of the inflationary effect which the establishment of the
                            proposed monopolies would inevitably have, such monopolies would
                            displace private agencies and enterprises which had been functioning for
                            many years and that such displacement would subject to further strain
                            China’s economy which is already being severely tested by China’s heroic
                            war effort. It is finally suggested that in view of the fact that all of
                            the United Nations are making every effort to streamline their
                            activities and to subject every proposed new activity to the <pb n="503"
                                xml:id="pg_503" facs="0513"/>test whether such activity would
                            contribute to the prosecution of the war there is offered for
                            consideration the suggestion that the present time would seem most
                            inopportune for the outlay of large sums of money and for the
                            expenditure of considerable effort and thought in connection with the
                            establishment of new government monopolies of the type under
                            reference.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the above, the Department considers it not desirable to
                            adopt a too insistent attitude in regard to this matter. We intend to
                            present our views of the matter in terms not of legal rights or of
                            national or private economic interest but in terms of what we regard as
                            a sound practice advantageous in the long swing to all concerned.</p>

                            notification which we received through the Chinese Ambassador of
                            arrangements for completion of the repayment of the Wood Oil Loan of
                            February 8, 1939, in advance of the schedule provided for in the
                            contract and entirely from the receipts of the wood oil exported to this
                            country, has caused this Government much gratification. I want you to

                            provision for completing repayment of the loan in question during these

                        <p>348. Sale of savings deposit certificates convertible into United States
                            dollars commences April 1. Response for 3-day period has been
                            disappointing. In Chungking deposits approximate 10 million <hi

                            of 6 million. Chinese officials and bankers are not optimistic with
                            regard to voluntary response, and public appears apathetic. Some form of
                            pressure on Chinese holders of liquid and other forms of capital is
                            contemplated in connection with commodity control and general
                            mobilization administration. It is said that Chinese businessmen and
                            prospective private investors have noted that redemption of savings
                            deposits and bonds in United States dollars is not guaranteed by the
                            American Government and are inclined to be skeptical of Chinese Minister
                            of Finance with regard to fulfillment of conversion and redemption
                            terms. The Embassy will report more fully on the situation as it

                        <p>Reference Chungking’s despatch no. 279, January 19, 1942,<note n="43"
                                xml:id="d391fn43">Not printed.</note> entitled “Chinese Government
                            Salt Monopoly; Status of Foreign Officers of the Salt Administration;
                            the Question of Good Faith Toward Foreign Bondholders”.</p>
                        <p>In the despatch under reference Mr. Gauss stated that he did not feel
                            that he should undertake representations in the matter without first
                            consulting the Department.</p>
                        <p>Aside from the interest of this Government in the orderly and efficient
                            functioning of agencies of the Chinese Government, there are two points
                            of direct interest to this Government in connection with repeated
                            efforts on the part of the Chinese Government to alter the organization
                            of the Chinese Salt Administration. The first of these points is the
                            safeguarding of the security for loans held by American citizens, and
                            the second point—growing out of and subordinate to the first one—is the
                            status and welfare of the American officials of the Salt Administration,
                            whose presence and authority had a direct relation to the terms under
                            which loans were made.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the first of the above-mentioned points, it is believed
                            that the question of repayment of loans by China will depend mainly upon
                            the solvency and soundness of the Chinese Government as a whole and not
                            upon the organization of some subordinate agency of the Government. It
                            is further believed that from now on it will be impracticable to impose
                            upon China foreign authority in Chinese Government agencies.</p>
                        <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0515"/>
                        <p>With regard to the second point, Mr. R. D. Wolcott, the sole remaining
                            American official in the Salt Administration, is understood to have
                            tendered his resignation and to be now in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Department, in its telegram no. 235, March 28, 2 [<hi rend="italic"
                                >6</hi>] p.m., to Chungking, explained to the Embassy its attitude
                            toward the general question of state monopolies (including salt) in
                            China at this time.</p>
                        <p>With the foregoing considerations in mind, FE is of the opinion that no
                            useful purpose would be served by further representations to the Chinese
                            Government on the specific question of the Salt Administration. FE
                            believes that the despatch under reference should be filed without
                            action.</p>

                            Finance this morning. Minister not present. Zabo [<hi rend="italic"
                                >Koo?</hi>] emphasized gravity of economic and financial situation,
                            frankly admitting position desperate. He felt reduction in exchange rate
                            to 5 cents imperative to insure sales of savings. Chairman indicated
                            that if reduction necessary now perhaps better to make it 4 cents at
                            once to avoid need for subsequent reduction or reductions. Tai insistent
                            that reduction to 5 cents enough and both Koo and he pledged that Board
                            would not be appealed to later to lower rate if sales of saving
                            certificates and bonds lag. Meeting ended with understanding that we
                            were to send formal letter to Board recommending lowering rate to 5
                            cents. All Board members except Hsi<note n="45" xml:id="d392fn45">Hsi
                                Te-mou.</note> agreed to act favorably.</p>
                        <p>2. Knowing your feeling on matter I saw Dr. Kung in the afternoon and
                            raised advisability of a 4-cent rate. He told me many people including
                            the Generalissimo [thought?] existing rate too low (!). He [said he?]
                            would favor 4 cents because it would make Government’s United States
                            dollars go further were it not for fact that it would weaken confidence
                            in <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> and that merchants and dealers would
                            immediately mark up their prices proportionately, therefore he felt 5
                            cents sufficient. When I pointed out disadvantages of lowering to 5
                            cents now and having to resort to lowerings later, he replied <pb
                                n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0516"/>he did not think it necessary.
                            He indicated that it is intended to give discount on United States
                            dollar-backed bond flotation in form of a 6-cent rate which would
                            gradually be lowered to par to put a premium on early buying.</p>
                        <p>3. Immediately afterwards I called upon Y. C. Koo, and O. K. Yui.<note
                                n="46" xml:id="d392fn46">Chinese Vice Ministers of Finance.</note>
                            Zabo [<hi rend="italic">Koo?</hi>] again stressed gravity of economic
                            situation. Circulation of <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> had risen from
                            $15,000,000,000 at end of December to 16,500,000,000 at end of February.
                            Volume of <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> in circulation plus Government
                            bank deposits increased from $23,000,000,000 to just under
                            26,000,000,000 in same period. Excepting change in prices, value of <hi
                                rend="italic">fapi</hi> in circulation plus Government bank deposits
                            at end of February only one-fourth of the value in July 1937. (While
                            safe to assume what is now occupied China then accounted for more than
                            half <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> and Government bank deposits,
                            proportion is now to be reversed. On the other hand, there has been
                            significant increase economic activity in Free China since then. Even by
                            assuming these factors to cancel each other out above drop in value
                            ominous.) Chungking wholesale price index, Koo continued, which rose
                            from 2700—Institute of Wartime Economic Research January–June 1937
                            equals 100—at end of December to 3,000 at end of February jumped to
                            3,700 in March. He said that sales of saving certificates insignificant
                            and reduction of exchange rate to 5 cents would stimulate them. Again I
                            pointed out better to make a bigger reduction now than to tamper with
                            exchange rate again later in order to force these sales and again Koo
                            agreed that latter should not be done.</p>
                        <p>However, he did so half-heartedly, even invoking purchasing power parity
                            to justify half-heartedness. In [the opinion of?] competent observers,
                            too much confidence cannot be placed in “pledge” not to resort to
                            further reductions to stimulate sales of government securities in case
                            of unfavorable developments. Position of Board would then be weak since
                            if it were reluctant to lower rate, whenever Ministry of Finance
                            insistent that securities sales campaign would benefit by so doing,
                            Board would be convenient scapegoat and alibi.</p>
                        <p>4. One factor in failure of savings certificates campaign which Ministry
                            will not admit is fact that many potential investors feel government may
                            not recompense in United States dollars when they fall due and are
                            disappointed that certificates do not have direct guarantee of United
                            States Treasury. Perhaps Ministry missed an opportunity in not bringing
                            in a semi-foreign [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] like [apparent omission]
                            in which investing public would undoubtedly have greater confidence. It
                            appears same thing is going to happen with United States dollar-backed
                            bond issue.[”]</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit, as of
                            possible interest to the Department, a condensed translation of an
                                article,<note n="50" xml:id="d394fn50">Not printed.</note>
                            outspokenly critical of deficiencies of the Chinese war effort, which
                            appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi>, Chungking, of April
                            13, 1942:</p>
                        <p>The gist of the article is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Although complete mass mobilization is essential in modern
                                    warfare and China has been at war for five years, her
                                    mobilization is still far from complete and is much behind that
                                    of other countries. The causes are the slackness of the
                                    Government and the lack of a sense of responsibility of the
                                    people.</p>
                                <p>The two most immediate problems are conscription of man-power and
                                    wealth: neither have been properly dealt with. Government
                                    monopolies of commodities do not tax the rich. Students and
                                    other influential classes have been exempted from military
                                    service. Conscription must be made universal.</p>
                            </quote>
                        </p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">It is rather surprising to find these ideas so strongly
                            and openly advocated by a journal of the influence and general
                            reputation for conservativeness of the <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung
                                Pao</hi>. It is almost exactly what the Communist <hi rend="italic"
                                >Hsin Hua Jih Pao</hi> has been saying in a much milder way in order
                            to circumvent the rigid censorship to which it is subjected. The Embassy
                            believes, however, that these ideas are representative of a large body
                            of Chinese opinion.</p>
                        <p>There has been in recent months a general criticism—usually, it is true,
                            more implied than expressed—of the Government’s failure to take more
                            positive measures to enforce its war time economic and conscription
                            laws, and to impose a proportionate burden on the wealthy by checking
                            speculation and hoarding and requiring subscription to government
                            bonds.</p>
                        <p>Hoarding, for instance, is prohibited by law and is punishable by death.
                            But a Chinese newspaper reader cannot but gain the impression that it is
                            universally prevalent (which is true) and is chiefly responsible for
                            present high price levels. Likewise, almost all papers have
                            editorialized for compulsory purchase by the well-to-do of government
                            bonds as a measure of financial support of the war and to reduce
                            hoarding. This attitude has been reinforced by the recent announcement
                            and subsequent disappointing public sale of savings certificates backed
                            by the American loan.</p>
                        <p>Monopolies have not been openly criticized (they are a part of the
                            sacrosanct theories of Sun Yat-sen) but the news of their inauguration
                                <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0519"/>has produced little
                            enthusiasm except in the more official organs; and there have been
                            numerous suggestions that close supervision will be necessary to avoid
                            malpractice and corruption, while some of the privately owned papers
                            have raised the question of the livelihood of the merchant whose
                            business has been in goods now being monopolized.</p>
                        <p>The exemption of students from conscription has likewise not been openly
                            criticized, probably because such exemption is a part of the
                            “Reconstruction” which the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek insist is a
                            fundamental basis of national policy, not less important than
                            “Resistance”. Some papers, such as the military organ <hi rend="italic"
                                >Sao Tang Pao</hi>, have editorially complained that the
                            conscription law is not being strictly enforced, that it is possible for
                            sons of officials and well-to-do to avoid conscription, and that the
                            exemption of students is a loophole for shirkers. The <hi rend="italic"
                                >Ta Kung Pao</hi>, itself, has been the leader in questioning, in a
                            rather cautious way, whether or not “reconstruction” should not, in view
                            of the desperate situation of the country, be considered more
                            realistically and subordinated to the present problem of “resistance”,
                            or, winning the war.</p>

                        <p>Recent reports from China indicate that the monetary and financial
                            condition of that country is going from bad to worse. I do not think
                            that anyone in this Department who was concerned with the recent
                            extension of $500,000,000 of financial assistance to China ever had any
                            illusions that any assistance which this country under existing
                            circumstances could extend to China would do any more than retard the
                            rate of deterioration of the Chinese fiscal and monetary position. It is
                            probably inevitable that until such time as shipping and military
                            considerations make possible closer economic contact between the United
                            States and China this Government will be able to offer little or no real
                            economic or financial assistance to China. The extent to which the
                            problem can be solved will depend almost entirely on the ability of the
                            Chinese Government itself to implement measures of <pb n="510"

                                rend="italic">fapi</hi> and deposits in government banks had each
                            increased about ten per cent. During the same period the Chungking
                            wholesale price index advanced from 2,700 to 3,000.</p>
                        <p>Recent reports from Chungking mention “the shortage of currency”, a
                            characteristic and bad sign in a progressively inflationary situation.
                            Apparently the Chinese are seeking to “correct” this condition by
                            substitution of Chinese Government securities for the <hi rend="italic"
                                >fapi</hi> acquired and held by the Stabilization Board against the
                            sale of dollars. Another “corrective” measure would seem to be the
                            putting into circulation by the Ministry of Finance of a quantity of
                            customs gold unit notes apparently to a <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi>
                            value of 2,000,000,000 yuan. It is of course unlikely that the Chinese
                            Government will be able to avoid securing the major part of its revenues
                            from additional issues of <hi rend="italic">fapi.</hi> I fear that the
                            only ultimate check on this is a shortage of bank note paper referred to
                            some months ago by Sir Otto Niemeyer<note n="51" xml:id="d395fn1">Head
                                of British economic mission in China.</note> and even this check can
                            largely be offset by increasing the denomination of the notes.</p>
                        <p>It will be recalled that there was some hope that by using part of the
                            financial aid from the United States as collateral the Government of
                            China through the mechanism of dollar guaranteed savings deposits and
                            bonds would be able to obtain some of its revenues from the savings of
                            the people rather than from the printing press. Our reports, however,
                            indicate that the savings deposits scheme has had very disappointing
                            results and our Embassy is not very optimistic as to the success of the
                            proposed special bond issue. Our Embassy has pointed out that two of the
                            principal difficulties seem to be (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the fact
                            that Chinese investors do not trust their own Government to see to it
                            that they get the dollar security which is supposed to be offered to
                            them and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) that the profits to be had from
                            speculation and trade in the existing inflationary situation are so
                            large that the supposed inducement of stability of value offered by the
                            savings deposits appears the less attractive alternative. A further
                            difficulty which may be shortly corrected seems to arise from the fact
                            that the dollar secured savings deposits are purchased at the rate of 20
                            yuan to the dollar whereas dollars can be bought officially at 18.8 yuan
                            to the dollar. This particular difficulty will, I believe, shortly be
                            ironed out by lowering the official rate to 20 yuan to the dollar.</p>
                        <p>There seems to be however, considerable divergence of opinion as to the
                            extent to which the yuan should be devalued. While it appears <pb
                                n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0521"/>likely that the devaluation
                            will be only to 5 cents there is apparently on the part of Kung and some
                            others a view that the yuan should be devalued to 4 cents were it not
                            for the fact that a devaluation of this magnitude might accentuate the
                            rise in prices and weaken confidence in the <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi>.
                            There is also some feeling that a situation may arise in which there
                            will be strong pressure for further devaluation from time to time to
                            stimulate the sale of the dollar backed savings deposits and bonds.</p>
                        <p>Other difficulties seem to center around the Stabilization Board of China
                            and the exact nature of the functions which it is supposed to perform.
                            In part these difficulties arise from what appears to be an increasing
                            impatience of China with respect to any form of outside control. As
                            evidences of this attitude I would cite: <list>

                                <item>The reported strong tendency in certain governmental quarters
                                    to belittle the Board and reduce its functions. This appears in
                                    part to arise from the fact that the Board has exhausted its
                                    sterling assets and there has yet been no decision by the
                                    British to replenish these assets from the sterling aid recently
                                    authorized by the British for China. Hall-Patch has made a
                                    suggestion to the British Government that this be done but so
                                    far as I know no action has been taken. It may be, however, that
                                    confusion as to the future role of the Board rather than
                                    reluctance of the British is the explanation for this situation.

                                    indicated recently to the Chinese that they would be willing to
                                    make available funds from the 50,000,000 pound British credit
                                    for the purchase of goods in the sterling area. As I understood
                                    Mr. Cochran, this offer was made when the Chinese recently
                                    wished to purchase quinine and certain other products from

                                <item>Although in the earlier stages of discussion of the use of
                                    part of the financial aid to China for dollar secured savings
                                    deposits and bonds it seemed to be generally assumed that the
                                    dollar collateral would be subject to the supervision or control
                                    of the Stabilization Board or some sort of an international
                                    group, the Chinese Government proceeded to launch the plan
                                    without requesting any specific advice from this Government and
                                    in complete disregard of any idea that the collateral would be
                                    subject to the supervision of anyone except the Chinese Ministry

                        </p>
                        <p>There also seems to be some question of revising the November 1
                            commitment of the Board to meet Chinese Governmental as well as personal
                            and commercial demands for sterling and dollar exchange in <pb n="512"
                                xml:id="pg_512" facs="0522"/>excess of the exchange accruing to
                            China from the proceeds of imports and remittances to China. It is
                            apparently the view of the Stabilization Board (particularly of
                            Hall-Patch) that the Board should not undertake to supply Chinese
                            Governmental needs for sterling or dollars. I suppose this arises in
                            part from the existence of the British and American financial aid and a
                            feeling that Governmental needs should be met from these rather than
                            from the funds of the Stabilization Board of China.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II</p>
                        <p>It is probable that under the circumstances any action which this
                            Government can take will center around advice to the Chinese Government
                            with a view to stimulating that Government to undertake the most
                            energetic counter inflationary measures possible within the limits of
                            its administrative competence. It is doubtful that from this distance we
                            can effectively advise China in detail. However the main lines along
                            which China should proceed seem clear and have already been indicated to
                            the Chinese Government by various advisers in China. It may be that we
                            can stimulate China to take further action along these lines or at least
                            indicate to that country that the solution of its difficulties will
                            depend primarily on China itself and that the recently granted United
                            States aid can by no means be regarded as a substitute for energetic
                            measures on the part of China itself.</p>
                        <p>It seems highly improbable that effective steps are being taken to
                            prevent banks in China from financing hoarding and speculative trading.
                            A suggestion that effective measures of control in this area be adopted
                            was made last December by Sir Otto Niemeyer. So far as I know the
                            Chinese Government has not actually undertaken to implement these
                            suggestions although a recent telegram reports criticism of the banks by
                            the Generalissimo of a vigorous but not very specific nature.</p>
                        <p>It is also not clear that the Chinese Government is doing all that it
                            could in controlling by rationing or otherwise the use of commodities
                            essential to the war effort or has made much progress in solving
                            problems of hoarding. It is of course unlikely that China could adopt a
                            very effective general price control or excess profits tax, however, I
                            have seen little indication that anything has been done to implement Sir
                            Otto Niemeyer’s suggestions that a report be made of available supplies
                            of essential war materials and the use of such materials be
                            controlled.</p>
                        <p>Both Sir Otto Niemeyer and Ambassador Gauss have suggested stimulation of
                            small scale or handicraft production of necessary goods. It is doubtless
                            highly desirable that vigorous action should be taken along these lines
                            but as a counter inflationary measure the results will, <pb n="513"
                                xml:id="pg_513" facs="0523"/>of course, be realized slowly.
                            Ambassador Gauss has also suggested using part of our aid to China to
                            finance redistribution of land in accordance with a land reform which
                            has long been contemplated. It may be that this is highly desirable from
                            a political point of view but it is dubious that reforms of this type
                            should be pushed now when the budgetary position of China is so
                            unsatisfactory.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that consideration should be given to the desirability of
                            placing the dollars securing the savings deposits and projected bond
                            issue in the hands of trust companies or an international group of
                            trustees. With respect to this matter, however, it must be borne in mind
                            that so long as China has an exchange control it will always have the
                            power to decide the rate at which residents of China may convert dollars
                            into yuan. This being the case it is possible that the trusteeing of the
                            dollar collateral will not afford sufficient additional protection to
                            appeal strongly to the Chinese people particularly in the face of the
                            highly profitable uses to which yuan can be put in China. Moreover,
                            China already having developed and begun to put into effect its own plan
                            it might be politically difficult both for us to approach the Chinese
                            Government about the matter and for China itself to make any change in
                            the indicated direction.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III</p>
                        <p>As suggested above China has already received plenty of sound advice as
                            to the general type of measures which are necessary. Moreover there are
                            doubtless several competent advisers in China (e. g. Arthur Young<note
                                n="54" xml:id="d395fn4">American adviser to the Chinese Ministry of
                                Finance.</note>) or officials in the Chinese Government itself who
                            are in a position to make sound detailed recommendations. The Chinese,
                            however, apparently give little weight to the advice of Mr. Young in
                            these matters and have obviously paid little attention to the
                            suggestions of Sir Otto Niemeyer. To put the matter bluntly, there seems
                            to be little chance of the Chinese Government accepting suggestions of
                            foreign advisers so long as these for political or other reasons are
                            difficult to implement. However the chances of making effective
                            suggestions may be to some extent increased if the advisers have
                            considerable force of personality and are able to establish a
                            satisfactory working basis with the Chinese. It is regrettable that in
                            the developing crisis the American member of the Stabilization Board
                            should be absent. It is not my understanding that Mr. Adler, who is
                            serving as alternate to Mr. Fox, has the stature and force to serve
                            effectively in this capacity. It may also be noted that some months ago
                            the Chinese Government requested a central banking expert, presumably

                            that it was considering this request but so far as I know no action was
                            ever taken on the matter. It may be difficult to find a suitable person,
                            but an able and forceful person of central banking experience might be
                            able to do some good in China at this time providing that a suitable
                            working basis could be established between him and Mr. Fox if the latter
                            is to return to China.<note n="55" xml:id="d395fn5">Notation by Alger

                        <p>In view of the particular relations of the Treasury Department to most of
                            the matters discussed above, it is doubtful that the Department would at
                            this point wish to make any direct suggestions to the Chinese Government
                            without clearance with the Treasury. I was informed by Mr. Southard of
                            the Treasury Department that that Department was going to give some
                            intensive consideration this week to the reply that should be made to
                            some of the questions raised in recent telegrams concerning the
                            Stabilization Board and its functions. On April 22 Treasury sent Mr.
                            Adler a telegram<note n="56" xml:id="d395fn6">Not printed.</note>
                            stating that the recent cable concerning a memorandum which the Board
                            proposed to submit to Dr. Kung is not clear and asking for Adler’s
                            evaluation of the Board’s proposals. Treasury indicated that other
                            questions might be answered later. It is possible, however, that if this
                            Department asked Treasury to confer with it on the subject of the
                            present financial situation of China we might stimulate a broader and
                            more thorough consideration of the whole problem than would otherwise be
                            the case. For such a conference I suggest the following as possible

                            Chungking’s telegram 396 of April 12, that the Department should review
                            the Chinese financial situation and consider whether it should take any
                            initiative concerning it, Mr. Luthringer has prepared a memorandum under

                            covering a telegram to Chungking which Mr. Luthringer has drafted rather
                            tentatively to crystallize a possible line of independent action by this
                            Department in case such is deemed desirable to at least open up the
                            situation more fully.</p>

                            an economic weekly report hereafter to be made in routine but which
                            shows a rapidly worsening situation, the price indices increasing by
                            percentages which I had better refrain from mentioning here. The index
                            figure cited in the second paragraph of Mr. Luthringer’s memorandum of
                            yesterday is left far behind by the March figure now reported.</p>
                        <p>The little Treasury group which deals with these matters has been busy
                            over Cuba and other questions lately but has rather expected to get busy
                            in the next few days on China.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit herewith two
                                memoranda<note n="60" xml:id="d397fn60">Neither printed.</note> of
                            conversation held by members of my staff with Mr. Solomon Adler of the
                            Stabilization Board of China and Dr. Y. C. Koo, Vice Minister of
                            Finance, concerning recent restrictions imposed by the Government upon
                            the business of commercial banks in China. There is also transmitted a
                            translation of a lecture<note n="61" xml:id="d397fn61">Not
                                printed.</note> delivered by the Director of the Monetary Department
                            of the Ministry of Finance in which the new regulations are outlined and
                            discussed.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows survey of banking history in China.]</p>
                        <p>The new regulations covering the operations of commercial banks consist
                            largely of measures designed to limit the flow of capital into
                            speculative activities and to divert it toward the financing of
                            productive enterprise and the distribution of commodities. If this were
                            accomplished, some of the burden now resting upon the Government banks
                            would be removed and the creation of new money could be curtailed.
                            Production would thus be increased further restricting inflationary
                            tendencies. In as much as the Government is unable and perhaps to some
                            extent unwilling to reduce its present level of expenditures, the
                            increase of production and the diversion of money into productive rather
                            than speculative purposes would appear to be the only method open for
                            combatting inflation.</p>
                        <p>At present there appears to be in the Government a strong desire to
                            strengthen the reserve position of the commercial banks which finds
                            expression in certain of the new regulations. Though the aim in itself
                            is praiseworthy, there may be a certain overemphasis on this aspect of
                            the banking problem at a time when the entire monetary system is in
                            danger. …</p>
                        <p>… A partial solution of the problem of inflation might lie in the drastic
                            taxation of those most able to pay, namely speculators, hoarders and
                            landlords, together with measures to compel these classes to buy
                            Government bonds and savings certificates in large amounts. Such
                            measures might have the effect of forcing these classes to disgorge
                            hoarded goods. It is noted, however, that hoarding of foodstuffs is
                            already legally punishable by death, but that the Government nonetheless
                            prefers to adopt indirect means to discourage hoarding, such as the
                            banking regulations, rather than to enforce this and similar laws. It
                            is, on the whole, doubtful that the Government, which is <pb n="517"
                                xml:id="pg_517" facs="0527"/>itself closely allied to banking and
                            land-holding interests, will undertake to place sufficiently severe
                            pressure upon those elements to induce any marked release of commodities
                            and diversion of capital to the uses of the Government.</p>

                        <p>Sir Frederick Phillips presented Mr. Hamilton with a copy of a draft of
                            the financial aid agreement with China which the British propose to ask
                            the Chinese Government to sign.<note n="63" xml:id="d399fn63">Not
                                printed.</note> He indicated that he thought that although the
                            Chinese Government would probably sign the agreement substantially as it
                            stands there might be some difficulty in obtaining Chinese consent. Sir
                            Frederick then stated that as we knew the British Government did not
                            feel that it was in a position to offer the Chinese Government aid in
                            such terms that the British might be presented after the conclusion of
                            hostilities with a situation in which China would have large accumulated
                            balances of sterling which could be presented in payment for exports of
                            goods and services from the sterling area. Therefore the British
                            Government had felt it necessary to stipulate that the sterling aid
                            could be <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0528"/>used only for Chinese
                            purchases of exports from the sterling area during the war or as
                            collateral for an internal issue of Chinese bonds. Sir Frederick
                            referred specifically to a provision in the proposed agreement to the
                            effect that Chinese sterling area purchases would be on the basis of
                            contracts concurred in by the Government of the United Kingdom as
                            particularly likely to encounter Chinese objection. Sir Frederick said
                            that they wished to keep us informed on the matter and he indicated that
                            it would be appreciated if we could use our influence with the Chinese
                            Government to obtain their consent to the proposed agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton replied that speaking for himself and without undertaking to
                            speak for higher officers of the Department he felt that such a course
                            would be most difficult in view of the nature of the United States
                            financial aid agreement which was signed several months ago.<note n="64"
                                xml:id="d399fn64">March 21; see bracketed note, <ref
                                    target="#pg_490">p. 490</ref>.</note> He then went on to say
                            that it had been our feeling that our financial aid to China was almost
                            entirely a political and military question and that financial
                            considerations had been secondary. He said that the political feeling in
                            China following the military reverses in the Far East had been such that
                            we considered it imperative to make a gesture of aid to China as
                            promptly as possible and of such a nature as to have the maximum
                            political effect in China. Having signed an agreement such as we had he
                            did not see how we could undertake to attempt to induce the Chinese to
                            sign a more restrictive agreement with the British. Mr. Hamilton then
                            referred to the prevalence of anti-foreign feeling in China the onus of
                            which we shared with other foreign countries and spoke of the danger of
                            taking any action which the Chinese might feel was motivated by
                            considerations of self-interest or imperialism.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Clarke remarked that the proposed British agreement was far from a
                            financial agreement of the usual type and the British felt that they had
                            gone as far as they could within the necessities of their financial
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton asked Mr. Luthringer his opinion. Mr. Luthringer replied
                            that he strongly concurred with the views Mr. Hamilton had expressed.
                            Mr. Luthringer added that on the other hand he felt that there were
                            great differences between the British financial position and our own and
                            that perhaps some of the Chinese at least might appreciate these
                            differences. Mr. Hamilton commented that he would leave such matters to
                            the financial experts. He repeated that he wished to call attention
                            simply to broad and important considerations of a political nature in
                            the Far Eastern situation.</p>
                        <p>Sir Frederick then said that even though we might not be in a position to
                            approach the Chinese on the matter he thought that if <pb n="519"
                                xml:id="pg_519" facs="0529"/>the Chinese approached us much would
                            depend upon the attitude which we took at the time. Sir Frederick asked
                            whether the Chinese had approached us and he was informed that so far as
                            Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Luthringer were aware no such approach had been
                            made to this Government.</p>
                        <p>Sir Frederick also remarked that it was the feeling of the British
                            Government that the sterling assets of the Stabilization Board of China
                            should not be replenished from the £50,000,000 of financial aid which is
                            the subject of the agreement under reference. He pointed out that none
                            of the $50,000,000 contribution of the United States to the Chinese
                            Stabilization Fund had yet been utilized and said that he had asked
                            Treasury whether it would object if some of these dollars were used to
                            acquire sterling for the Stabilization Fund. He indicated that he had
                            not yet received an answer to this inquiry.</p>
                        <p>Sir Frederick stated that this whole matter had been taken up by him with
                            Dr. White of the Treasury Department but that he had not yet received an
                            indication of the Treasury Department’s reaction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton said that we would, of course, be glad to refer this matter
                            to other officers of the Department and inform the Treasury Department
                            of Sir Frederick’s and Mr. Clarke’s approach to us.</p>

                        <p>With respect to the conversation this morning with Sir Frederick Phillips
                            and his request for our assistance in securing Chinese acquiescence to
                            the terms of the agreement proposed by the British I have been wondering
                            whether we might not take a position somewhat intermediate between that
                            requested by the British and what as I understand it was our indication
                            that we could not intervene in any way to secure Chinese acceptance of a
                            financial aid agreement substantially less liberal than our own. As I
                            recall Sir Frederick did remark that if the Chinese Government comes to
                            us about the matter much would depend on the way in which we handled the
                            situation, but I do not recall that we made any direct response to
                            this.</p>
                        <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0530"/>
                        <p>I have been wondering whether we could not inform the British that (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) as indicated in our conversation with Sir
                            Frederick we did not feel that we could take any initiative in
                            approaching the Chinese about the matter and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                            if, however the Chinese should approach the Department on its own
                            initiative we are prepared to take the line that we thought that this
                            was a matter which should be settled entirely between the British
                            Government and the Chinese Government and that the British Government
                            itself was the best judge of what conditions must necessarily be imposed
                            on financial assistance extended by the British to China in the light of
                            the over-all British financial and foreign exchange position. Since,
                            however, our opinion had been asked we thought that the Chinese
                            Government must keep in mind that the British Government and the United
                            States Government were in an entirely different financial situation. The
                            gold and foreign exchange resources of the British Government had been
                            seriously depleted by expenditures for war purposes as the Chinese
                            Government is doubtless aware. Our program of lend-lease and other types
                            of assistance to the British were in large part made necessary by the
                            depletion of British foreign exchange resources. The British will end
                            the war with their foreign exchange resources largely depleted and hence
                            cannot undertake to the same degree as the United States to extend
                            unconditional financial assistance to other United Nations in ways which
                            will give the recipient of this aid very large claims to goods and
                            services in the United Kingdom which may be presented only after the
                            war. In the light of these considerations it would seem to us that in
                            general the conditions imposed by the British should be regarded as
                            arising from the financial necessities of the British situation rather
                            than any difference in attitude toward China of the British Government
                            and this Government.</p>
                        <p>It may be that the foregoing would go a little too far but I believe that
                            essentially it would be a realistic and justifiable position for us to
                            take. There is no getting around the fact that the vastly different
                            financial situation of the sterling area and this Government does permit
                            us to make sweeping gestures in the financial field which the British
                            cannot afford to parallel. The British are making every effort to
                            prevent great accumulations of sterling in hands of other countries
                            which will one day present them in payment for British goods or services
                            leaving the British without means of obtaining the goods and services
                            which the British will at that time find necessary to import. From the
                            broad point of view of post-war economic policy I believe that we also
                            have a direct and strong interest in assisting the British to minimize
                            the accumulation of sterling balances in the hands of persons or
                            governments outside the sterling area. It should be noted that the
                            British restriction on the use of the sterling which they propose to
                            advance does not apply to sterling used to guarantee Chinese bonds <pb
                                n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0531"/>but only to that used to
                            purchase goods and services. Moreover although we have no parallel in
                            our agreement to the British provision that Chinese purchases must be on
                            the basis of contracts in which the British Government concurs I am not
                            sure that this provision is an arbitrary one. Unless some provision of
                            this type were included the Chinese might nullify the British provision
                            that purchases must be made during hostilities by negotiating long-term
                            contracts. Moreover all of the sterling area countries have export
                            controls and there must therefore be governmental approval at some point
                            in the proceedings as to the export of specific kinds and quantities of
                            goods to the Chinese.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II</p>
                        <p>You will recall that Sir Frederick informed us that he had put to the
                            Treasury the suggestion that the depleted sterling balances of the
                            Stabilization Board of China be replenished by sale of part of the
                            dollar assets of the Board, the $50,000,000 United States contribution
                            to which not having yet been drawn upon at all. Sir Frederick said that
                            he had not yet received any reply from the Treasury on this proposition.
                            I had a feeling that our Treasury had already indicated a willingness to
                            go along with such a suggestion. On checking back through the telegrams
                            pertaining to the Stabilization Board I found that on May 2, 1942,
                            telegram 344 to Chungking,<note n="65" xml:id="d400fn65">Not
                                printed.</note> the Treasury Department had informed Adler that
                            “with reference to the anticipated depletion of the sterling assets of
                            the Board, if sterling is not available from other sources, Treasury has
                            no objection to using its dollar assets for the purchase of sterling”.
                            For some reason not altogether clear to me our Treasury has not informed
                            Sir Frederick of this. It may be that the particular person who talked
                            with Sir Frederick was not aware of this message to Adler. I feel,
                            however, that it is up to the Treasury Department rather than this
                            Department to inform the British.</p>

                                    different from the foreign exchange position of the United
                                    States; that the question of the terms of an agreement between
                                    the British Government and the Chinese Government is of course
                                    something to be worked out between the two Governments party to
                                    the proposed agreement; and that our principal interest, and it
                                    is a real one, is that agreements for cooperation between or
                                    among any of the allied nations be worked out amicably and
                                    harmoniously. We should of course, in my judgment, be careful
                                    not to encourage the Chinese in any anti-British feeling which
                                    they may evidence. At the same time it is believed that we
                                    should avoid appearing to be a special pleader for the British

                            China</p>
                        <p>I concur with Dr. Hornbeck’s opinion.<note n="69" xml:id="d402fn69">See
                                footnote 67, above.</note> We decided at the time of the five
                            hundred million dollar loan to China that we would not enter into a
                            joint arrangement with the British for financing China, in view of the
                            difference in Chinese attitude towards Britain and towards ourselves. It
                            would follow that there is now no reason for entering deeply into the
                            terms which the British wish to impose on the Chinese in respect of the
                            assistance Britain is herself willing to grant.</p>
                        <p>It is perfectly true that the British financial position is not the same
                            as our own, and that from their own point of view they are probably
                            warranted in imposing conditions which we should feel unnecessary, or
                            perhaps even unwise. It is also true that sterling probably has less
                            immediate advantages to the Chinese at this time.</p>
                        <p>It would follow that Dr. Hornbeck’s suggestion, namely, that we do not
                            enter too deeply into the matter except to bring to the attention <pb
                                n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0533"/>of the British the feelings of
                            the Chinese, is probably the best policy.</p>
                        <p>I believe the copies of the relevant documents should be forwarded to the
                            Treasury for their information. If the position outlined is taken, I
                            should not expect that there will be any reason for the Treasury to
                            intervene in the matter. They may, however, wish to express a view to

                        <p>510. 1. The Department has received the general impression that despite
                            the recent financial aid extended by the United States to China the
                            monetary and fiscal situation of China is continuing to deteriorate. The
                            Department also has the feeling that China, itself, as indicated in your
                            despatch 384 of April 23, is perhaps not taking as energetic steps of a
                            counter inflationary nature as might be practicable. Specifically has
                            China ever taken any steps to implement such suggestions as those
                            contained in points no. (1), (3) and (4) in the memorandum prepared by
                            Sir Otto Niemeyer which was handed to you on December 20 by the British
                            Ambassador? (Your despatch no. 261, December 31, 1941).<note n="72"
                                xml:id="d405fn72">Not printed; the points under reference related to
                                the desirability of the Chinese Government taking steps to ration
                                critical war materials, organize and encourage domestic hand work
                                production, and establish control over private bank credit and rates
                                of interest.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. If such steps have been undertaken do you think that China is doing
                            along these lines whatever may be feasible or reasonably expected?</p>
                        <p>3. The Department would be glad to receive your suggestions or views as
                            to any measures of rationing, price control; stimulation of production,
                            or control of bank credit which China might appropriately adopt.</p>
                        <p>4. Do you know whether the Chinese Government continues to be interested
                            in obtaining a central banking expert from this country and have you any
                            views as to the desirability of sending such a person to China promptly
                            if a person with the proper qualifications can be obtained? Do not make
                            any special inquiry of the Chinese Government on this point.</p>

                        <p>732. Your 510, June 10, 7 p.m. It is true the monetary and economic
                            situation in China continues to deteriorate. In connection with failure
                            of American credit favorably to influence situation, reference is made
                            to despatch No. 266 of January 8.<note n="73" xml:id="d406fn73">

                        </p>
                        <p>In April currency circulation totaled 18,500,000,000, thirteen times <pb
                                n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0535"/>prewar figure. Present rate of
                            issue about 800,000,000 monthly. In June last year circulation was about
                            10,500,000,000 while in January this year it was close to
                            15,000,000,000.</p>
                        <p>Government expenditures to date are said to be within budget estimate of
                            17,000,000,000 for the year. Tax revenues have shown improvement and it
                            is estimated will reach 6,000,000,000 or 7,000,000,000, including land
                            tax in kind.</p>
                        <p>Wholesale price index Chungking in April reached roughly 4,300 against
                            2,400 last December and 1,400 in June last year. Base figure is 100 for
                            first half 1937.</p>
                        <p>So far only use of American loan has been as backing for issues of
                            American dollar bonds and savings certificates. It was hoped that sale
                            of these securities would retard inflation but so far sale[s] have been
                            too small to affect situation. Several reasons have been given for
                            limited demand, including failure to place the American dollar security
                            in trust fund, large profits to be had from speculative ventures,
                            suspicion that ultimate holders of American dollar credits will be
                            subject to Chinese Government controls on foreign trade and exchange
                            transactions and failure to place any time-limit on availability of
                            bonds at present advantageous exchange rate. Action could be taken to
                            remove some of these criticism[s].</p>
                        <p>Some measures similar to those recommended in Niemeyer memo<note n="74"
                                xml:id="d406fn74">See telegram No. 516, December 21, 1941, 10 a.m.,
                                from the Ambassador in China, <ref target="frus1941v05#pg_766">

                            undertaken. Gasoline is being rationed and private stocks requisitioned.
                            Inventories of some essential commodities are being undertaken.</p>
                        <p>A credit of 100,000,000 Chinese dollars will probably be granted to the
                            industrial cooperatives, but government encouragement to small-scale
                            productive enterprises is halfhearted. Increased production of consumer
                            goods should be undertaken.</p>
                        <p>Hoarding and speculation continue practically unchecked. Chinese
                            legislation in these fields is ineffective as well as with regard to
                            price control and national mobilization in general. Enforcement is not
                            in expert or competent hands. The fact is China has not reached a
                            standard of administration organization and efficiency permitting of
                            national demobilization and controls required for a war economy. It is
                            also a fact that landlords and bankers have considerable influence in
                            the Kuomintang and Government with the result that measures against
                            their interests are in large degree opposed or made ineffective.</p>
                        <p>From July 1 Central Bank is to take over the note issue of other
                            Government banks. By this action it is hoped to check currency inflation
                            through stricter control of note issues. Regulations for control bank
                            credit have been adopted but interest rates have not been subjected to
                            control. Restriction on speculative activities of private <pb n="526"
                                xml:id="pg_526" facs="0536"/>banks and cash shops should be
                            undertaken but would be difficult of enforcement.</p>
                        <p>Competent observers commenting on economic situation point out social and
                            political dangers from inflation tend to be less in this country than in
                            more highly organized countries since over 75 percent of economy is
                            agricultural and hence less sensitive to monetary difficulties. They
                            admit, however, the situation is becoming more serious; but it seems to
                            be general feelings, shared by Embassy, that China will continue for
                            some time at least to get along as it has in the past using half
                            measures avoiding collapse. The promise of bumper crops this year
                            following good harvest last year is more encouraging than government
                            activity.</p>
                        <p>No interest in a central banking expert has been expressed recently and
                            no action should be taken except in response to an official request from
                            Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>It is assumed that the Department sees the weekly reports which Embassy
                            has encouraged Adler to send through the Department to Treasury. They
                            contain current information in regard to many of matters discussed
                            above.</p>
                        <p>Embassy does not believe there are practicable measures that we could
                            take to improve economic situation in China at this time and has
                            impression that the Chinese do not expect or desire further assistance
                            or advice from us now.</p>

                            very helpful. Although it sees and studies with care the weekly reports
                            from Adler for the Treasury it nevertheless would consider it very
                            helpful to receive the Embassy’s own views and analytical comments on
                            these matters from time to time. It is of course not necessary for the
                            Embassy to duplicate the factual aspects of Adler’s reports.</p>

                        <p>778. With the death of Dr. Fox, there is no American member of the
                            Stabilization Board, Adler having served only as alternative for <pb
                                n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0537"/>Fox and having now no legal
                            status with the Board. It would seem to the Embassy to be desirable that
                            the Secretary of the Treasury take steps as soon as possible to provide
                            for an American member on the Board which while not very active at the
                            present time nevertheless does have problems for solution in which
                            American people should have its voice. Might I suggest that Adler, who
                            is thoroughly familiar with the operations of the Board, be nominated to
                            serve at least as the interim American member, retaining, however, his
                            Treasury status. It is my understanding that Dr. Fox was the only member
                            of the Board who received compensation from the Board. The British
                            member being an officer of the British Government drew no compensation
                            from the Board while no action was ever taken to provide compensation
                            for the Chinese members. I suggest, therefore, that Adler continue to
                            draw his salary from the Treasury Department making it unnecessary to
                            ask for compensation for him from the Board.</p>

                        <p>779. Following for the Secretary of the Treasury from Adler.</p>
                        <p>TF–46. Dr. Kung sent for me on June 29 and informed me he would like to
                            consult you on the following question.</p>
                        <p>The Central Bank of China still owes the United States stabilization fund
                            between United States dollars 19 to 20,000,000 of the approximately
                            United States dollars 48,000,000 credit it received in 1937.<note n="75"
                                xml:id="d409fn75">See Treasury Department press release of July 9,
                                1937, and memorandum of July 12 by the President of the
                                Export-Import Bank of Washington, <ref target="frus1937v04#pg_611">

                                    target="frus1937v04#pg_612">612</ref>, respectively.</note> This
                            credit was fully secured by gold purchased by Dr. Kung from the Treasury
                            on your advice in that year. He informed me that on several occasions in
                            the past he was advised to use this gold on which he was earning no
                            interest to liquidate in its entirety this debt on which he was paying
                            interest. But he was and still is reluctant to part with all the gold
                            purchased on your advice because he appreciated the spirit of your
                            advice and regarded China’s retaining some gold on earmark in the United
                            States as a symbol of good will between the Ministry of Finance and the
                            Treasury. However, it is not easy at this time for the Central Bank to
                            raise the United States dollars 19 to 20,000,000 to pay off the debt
                            from other sources. He could, of course, use the remaining Chinese gold
                            held in the United States <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0538"/>for
                            this purpose. But the alternative he would prefer would be for the
                            Treasury to advance another approximately United States dollars
                            19,000,000 from the United States dollars 500,000,000 loan to China to
                            enable him to clear the debt. He would appreciate learning your reaction
                            to this proposal.</p>
                        <p>The net effect of the transaction contemplated by Dr. Kung would be that
                            China would pay off the debt to the United States stabilization fund
                            with the gold it now holds in the United States and would acquire an
                            equivalent amount of gold with an advance from the United States dollars
                            500,000,000 loan. [Adler.]</p>

                        <p>576. For Dr. H. H. Kung, Minister of Finance from Henry Morgenthau, Jr.,
                            Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
                        <p>The passing of Mr. Fox has deprived both China and the United States of a
                            devoted and wise public servant. Until a permanent successor is
                            appointed and in view of the fact that Mr. William Taylor, the American
                            Alternate, is being held by the Japanese in Hong Kong, I would like to
                            suggest that China appoint an Acting Alternate to perform the duties and
                            obligations conferred on the American Member of the Stabilization Board
                            by the April 1st Agreement.<note n="76" xml:id="d410fn76">Signed at

                            return to the United States. His long experience with the United States
                            Treasury and his recent activities in China make him eminently qualified

                        <p>841. TF–50. To Secretary of the Treasury from Adler. At the time of his
                            death Mr. Fox was working on economic report mentioned in (1) of TF–40
                            of May 26.<note n="78" xml:id="d414fn78">Telegram No. 605, May 26, 11
                                a.m., <ref target="#pg_523">p. 523</ref>.</note> Following is
                            write-up of draft he left.</p>
                        <p>(1) Conclusion. Economic situation has worsened since beginning of 1942.
                            From January to May prices rose and note issue expanded at about the
                            same rates as in last 5 months of 1941. Both revenues and expenditures
                            are running at higher levels than last year, and while revenue side
                            improved as a result of land tax, Government still has to rely on issue
                            to cover two-thirds of current expenditures. Apart from beneficial
                            psychological effects American loan has thus far contributed little to
                            meeting China’s financial problems. Gravity of economic situation to
                            some extent relieved by favorable prospects for 1942 harvest.</p>
                        <p>2. Prices. According to official data, Chungking general wholesale price
                            level for May was 4790 and the retail 4300 (January–June 1937 equals
                            100). Increase since January 50–60 percent or about the same as between
                            August and December 1941. Wholesale price of [apparent omission] in May
                            32 [apparent omission] retail 3940, retail jumping 80% from January to
                            May or more than double increase of preceding 5 months. Price movements
                            in cities outside Chungking parallel those in Chungking with
                            considerable local divergencies. Rate of increase in prices has not
                            accelerated in 1942 in the face of cutting off of foreign sources of
                            supply and continued solely on expansion of note issue to finance
                            deficits.</p>
                        <p>In spite of commodity administration national mobilization program and
                            recent plans to control food prices, satisfactory mechanisms for prices
                            control have not yet been established nor has any real progress been
                            made toward their establishment. Definite tendency for greater resort to
                            barter forms now evident.</p>
                        <p>3. Note issue in May CN dollars 20,032 million with 25% more than in
                            January; increase from August to December 1941 27%. Prices are rising
                            twice as fast as note issue.</p>

                        <p>4. Budgetary situation. Expenditures January–May CN dollars 7570 million
                            or promiscuously [<hi rend="italic">approximately?</hi>] 44% of
                            estimates for the year and 80% of net expenditures 1941. Military

                            administration, et cetera, CN dollars 2359 million or about 30% of
                            estimate for year and of current expenditures and nearly 80% above total

                            collections at CN dollars 100 per picul accounts for almost half 1942
                            revenues.</p>
                        <p>Current deficit of CN 5212 million met almost entirely by Government bank
                            advances to Government against which they take up or hypothecate
                            Government securities serving as backing for further issue of legal
                            tender. Dark side of fiscal picture continues to be Government’s
                            inability to induce public to purchase its securities voluntarily on
                            significant scale. Net sale of United States dollar backed securities
                            from April 1 to May 31 under Chinese national dollars 75 million. While
                            certain improvements in terms and methods of their issue might have
                            helped somewhat, it was Mr. Fox’s considered opinion they would not have
                            made appreciable difference. Thus loan has not been of much value in
                            ameliorating fiscal situation so far. In this connection there has been
                            recently some discussion of advisability of using American loan to

                        <p>5. Public debt. On December 31, 1941 (?) internal debt incurred in
                            sterling, United States dollars, and custom gold units totaled
                            equivalent of CN dollars 5.5 billion at present rate of exchange. Loans
                            of 4 Government banks to the Government totaled CN dollars 16.2 billion,
                            constituting 80% of all their loans and apparently 90% of the internal
                                <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> debt.</p>
                        <p>6. Industrial production—on basis of incomplete and inadequate
                            data—appears to have maintained itself in first quarter of 1942.
                            Production of minerals for export and fuels somewhat higher than in
                            first quarter of 1941, but shortage of imported materials and parts
                            becoming apparent in manufacture.</p>
                        <p>7. Agriculture. Harvest prospects this year encouraging. Wheat crop
                            estimated at 222,000,000 piculs (one picul equals 110 pounds), while
                            preliminary estimates for all important rice crop are 85–90% of 1931–40
                            average. In agricultural country such as China favorable harvest
                            prospects should help relieve immediate anxiety about admittedly grave
                            economic situation.</p>
                        <p>Government expects to raise 43,000,000 piculs of cereals—or almost double
                            1941–42 collections through land tax—and 33,000,000 piculs—about the
                            same as last year’s purchases—through compulsory <pb n="532"

                        <p>638. For Adler from Secretary Morgenthau. Your cable of June 30, 1942,
                            No. TF–46,<note n="79" xml:id="d415fn79">Telegram No. 779, June 30, 1
                                p.m., <ref target="#pg_527">p. 527</ref>.</note> regarding 1937
                            arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Please advise Dr. Kung that the Treasury is glad to cooperate with him in
                            liquidating the debt owed by the Central Bank of China to the U. S.
                            Stabilization Fund amounting to approximately $19 million. The Treasury
                            fully appreciates and understands Dr. Kung’s desire that China have
                            earmarked gold in the United States as a symbol of goodwill between the
                            Ministry of Finance and the Treasury.</p>
                        <p>Since the 1937 arrangement and the 1942 financial aid agreement stem from
                            different statutory provisions, and in order that the record will be
                            unquestionable that the 1937 arrangement will have been liquidated
                            without recourse to other sources of financial aid, it is suggested that
                            China use the gold now being held as collateral in the Federal Reserve
                            Bank to repurchase the outstanding yuan purchased by the United States
                            under the 1937 arrangement amounting to approximately $19 million. The
                            gold being held as collateral in the Federal Reserve Bank, New York, is
                            more than sufficient to repurchase the outstanding yuan. If China agrees
                            to repurchase the outstanding yuan with the gold being held as
                            collateral, there will be a balance of a small amount of gold plus a
                            very small amount of dollars. The Treasury believes that this procedure
                            is definitely in the interests of China from the point of view of
                            maintaining China’s splendid record.</p>
                        <p>The Treasury is, of course, ready to consider sympathetically selling an
                            equivalent amount of gold to China for dollars made available to China
                            under the $500,000,000 financial aid agreement.</p>

                            Difficulties”.</p>
                        <p>The editorial presents a summary of discussion at a round table
                            conference of the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank of
                            China according to which the problems confronting China today are (1)
                            lack of materials and (2) inflation. The conference made the following
                            five recommendations to meet the problem of inflation, four of which
                            hinge upon the use of the British and American Loans and all of which
                            have as their goal the withdrawal of currency from circulation in order
                            to check inflation: (1) increase of the sales of gold bonds and gold
                            savings certificates; (2) sale of gold by the Government; (3) widening
                            of the scope of foreign exchange transactions; (4) issuance of
                            industrial bonds backed by United States currency; and (5) issuance of
                            investment and credit bonds in Chinese currency. It should be noted that
                            at the last report only CNC$70,000,000 of the Savings Certificates and
                            CNC$10,000,000 of the Victory Bonds issued against the backing of the
                            American loan had been sold.</p>

                        <p>893. For Secretary of the Treasury from Currie. Have indicated informally
                            to Dr. Kung the growing resentment of our diplomatic and military and
                            charitable organizations over declining purchasing power of United
                            States dollar in China. Raised the question of leaving official rate as
                            is but giving special rate for special purposes. It would be helpful if
                            you make inquiry of Adler here as to what, if anything, is being
                            considered to meet the situation and ask what rate of exchange would
                            restore purchasing power of United States dollar in China to that of one
                            year, [or] two years ago. [Currie.]</p>

                            China. Mr. Currie says that he has raised the question of leaving the
                            official rate as is but giving special rates for special purposes.</p>
                        <p>Please send all information available regarding the following matters:

                            would approximate purchasing power of the U. S. dollar in China to that
                            of one year or two years ago; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Are there
                            significant differences between the purchasing power of the U. S. dollar
                            in Chungking and its purchasing power in other areas in Free China where
                            Americans reside; and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) What, if anything, is
                            being considered to meet the situation outlined by Mr. Currie.</p>

                            whether you feel this matter should be raised with the Chinese

                        <p>707. From the Secretary of the Treasury for Adler. Your 891, July 31, 10
                            a.m. from Currie informs us that Hall-Patch insists that Treasury
                            recommendation of you is not in accordance with Sino-American Agreement
                            and that you cannot function on the Board in that capacity and that
                            Treasury recommendation is at variance with Dr. Kung’s appointment of
                            you as acting member on July 17. It is not clear to us here why
                            Hall-Patch is passing on any of these matters since they involve
                            exclusively matters between China and the United States under the
                            Sino-American Agreement of April 1, 1941 and the title to be accorded to
                            the American representative on the Board. We are satisfied that our
                            recommendation to Dr. Kung to designate you as “acting alternate member”
                            and Dr. Kung’s acceptance of that recommendation, as indicated in
                            telegram from Dr. Kung to Secretary of Treasury dated July 6 and sent
                            through Gauss No. 796, make entirely legal your acting as the American
                            representative on the Board and that there is no reason for Board
                            meetings to be postponed or the Board’s business held up by reason of
                            the title of your designation. Kindly bring the foregoing to the
                            attention of Dr. Kung and Dr. Chen<note n="84" xml:id="d420fn84">K.P.

                        <p>During a call this afternoon on Mr. Rouse of the Chinese Maritime Customs
                            concerning another matter I took the opportunity of inquiring about the
                            recently announced regulations governing imports and exports. Mr. Rouse
                            stated that to all intents and purposes unlimited trade between Free
                            China and the occupied areas was now permitted under the regulations,
                            that the Government recognized the impossibility of preventing such
                            trade, that Free China was greatly in need of various articles produced
                            in the occupied areas or in Japan and that the Chinese Government
                            sanctioned the trade as a means of obtaining <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536"
                                facs="0546"/>the commodities desired and as a means of revenue which
                            would otherwise be lost because of smuggling. Mr. Rouse was of the
                            opinion that regardless of what articles were on the prohibited list,
                            such as wood oil, they would continue to be exported to the occupied
                            areas.</p>

                                a year ago. While Chungking wholesale and retail price indices have
                                just about trebled in the last 12 months, neither is a satisfactory
                                measure of the precise amplitude of price movements in general, let
                                alone of those price movements most relevant for assessing changes
                                in the cost of living of foreigners. It is the consensus of opinion
                                among Americans here that their money goes about half as far as it
                                did a year ago. Thus both United States Government officials and
                                missionaries find their living expenses doubled, while charitable
                                organizations spending twice as much money as they did last year
                                find it hardly goes any further. (Americans affected include about
                                30 Government officials, 1000 soldiers, 500 missionaries, et cetera,
                                and a handful of journalists and businessmen.)</item>

                            <item>I gather from informal conversation with Dr. Kung that the Chinese
                                Government is strongly opposed to special rates of exchange.
                                Nevertheless no harm would ensue and some good might [come?] from
                                raising the question officially as it would probably hasten the
                                Chinese Government’s adopting some form of reciprocal Lend-Lease in
                                addition to giving more force to the next representation on the

                                        May 16, the Central Bank cabled the Federal asking them for
                                        their views and advice as to the possibility of investing a
                                        portion or whole of the $200 million in their special

                                        bills were best suited for the investment of funds of the

                                        has been heard from the Central Bank regarding this matter.

                                that Minister of Finance would still prefer to invest in War Savings
                                bonds but is chary of possible reactions in Washington.

                        <p>930. For Dr. H. H. Kung, Minister of Finance from Henry Morgenthau,
                            Secretary of the Treasury. Dr. William H. Taylor has returned to the
                            United States from Hong Kong and has resigned his position as alternate
                            American member of the Stabilization Board as of September 30, 1942. In
                            view of these facts, I would like to recommend that Mr. Solomon Adler,
                            who is at present acting alternate American member of the Stabilization
                            Board, be appointed alternate American member of the Stabilization Board
                            at the same salary which the previous alternate was paid. Until an
                            American member is appointed, Mr. Adler could function as the acting
                            American member of the Stabilization Board. [Morgenthau.]</p>

                        <p>1147. For the Secretary of the Treasury from Adler.</p>
                        <p>TF–63. Had an informal conversation with Dr. Kung covering work of Board,
                            current economic situation, and Sino-American financial relations.</p>
                        <p>1. Re work of Board, Dr. Kung expressed the hope that we were adopting as
                            lenient a policy as possible in granting exchange for commercial
                            imports.</p>
                        <p>I answered in the affirmative, pointing out that amounts involved were
                            very small, as the only routes from India were by air and via Tibet. He
                            raised possibility of Board’s granting exchange for commercial imports
                            from Russia which is accepting United States dollars for its exports to
                            China. I indicated Board was only too anxious to facilitate imports into
                            China and was sure it would be willing to investigate this possibility.
                            Before Board formally takes up the question, therefore, I should
                            appreciate your letting me know whether you approve in principle the
                            Board’s granting United States dollars exchange for commercial imports
                            from Russia.</p>
                        <p>2. Re current economic situation, Dr. Kung agreed China’s main problem
                            now not military or political but economic. <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>He felt drastic budgetary curtailment was essential. (In this
                                    connection, Dr. T. F. Tsiang, head of the Political Department
                                    of the Executive Yuan, informed me yesterday that cuts in
                                    expenditures to the extent of 6% to 8% could and should be made
                                    in the draft 1943 budget the Executive Yuan was now working
                                    on.[)]</item>

                                <item>He was inclined to think universal price ceiling scheme
                                    impractical in China.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
                                <item>In order to mop up <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> in pleasing of
                                    public, he was considering establishing a free gold market and
                                    reducing the maturity periods of the various United States
                                    dollar-backed securities the Chinese Government has
                                    issued.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Re Sino-American financial relations, Dr. Kung indicated that in
                            accordance with his promise to consult you on the uses of the American
                            loan to China, he would take no action on 2 (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)
                            above until he had officially consulted you, which he intended doing
                            shortly.</p>
                        <p>The amount of gold Dr. Kung is contemplating using for internal sale is
                            about United States dollars 20,000,000 or roughly that amount, he
                            informed me, as he had just repaid the Treasury in settlement of 1937
                            stabilization arrangement. Once he had obtained your consent he would
                            purchase in such event gold from the Treasury—presumably with funds from
                            the 1942 American loan.</p>
                        <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0550"/>
                        <p>He then raised the question referred to in part II (<hi rend="italic"
                                >b</hi>) of your 834 of September 14, again indicating he intended
                            officially consulting you on the matter in the near future before taking
                            action.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Finally Dr. Kung brought up the difficulties
                            foreigners were experiencing as a result of rising prices. He was
                            particularly anxious to alleviate the lot of the United States Army. The
                            only special exchange rate he appeared to be considering was one for the
                            United States currency the United States Army in China is in receipt of.

                                arrival in the United States from Hong Kong and my regret that he
                                has resigned his position as alternate member of Stabilization Board

                                that you recommend Mr. Solomon Adler, the acting alternate American
                                member of the Stabilization Board, be appointed alternate American
                                member of the Board at the same salary as paid to the previous
                                alternate, until an American member be appointed. I am therefore

                            our cable No. 834, dated September 14, 1942, requesting study of
                            magnitude of foreign exchange transactions in Free China. Treasury is
                            anxiously awaiting this study and would be pleased to receive the
                            information as soon as possible. The Treasury would also appreciate
                            receiving in the immediate future your preliminary findings and views on
                            this problem, and will treat and consider them as preliminary.

                                overvalued. Since July 1941 prices, in Chungking have more than
                                trebled. Rate of one <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> equals United
                                States cents l¼-2½ would be much more equitable whether in terms of
                                foreigners’ cost of living in China or of international prices of
                                China’s exports and imports. But (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) China’s
                                unsettled condition renders question of change of rate relatively
                                less urgent from point of view of China’s internal economic
                                position, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Ministry of Finance is strongly
                                opposed to any change of official rate on above ground and on ground
                                that it would further undermine internal confidence in <hi

                            <item>However special exchange rate for utilitarian purposes also has
                                disadvantages. Difficulty is that if special rate granted for one
                                agency [—]e. g., army—only, agencies not covered would protest
                                against it; and if it is granted for all purposes for promulgating
                                dollar transactions, it would have to be granted for sterling and
                                other currency transactions too. In this eventuality, official
                                exchange rate would become a fiction. Moreover a wide discrepancy
                                between special rate and official rate would be liable to be
                                injurious to internal confidence in <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> as
                                an equivalent change in official rate.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>It would appear therefore that if any change in rate were to be
                                made, a change in official rate would be preferable to a special
                                rate or rates.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>But in view of situation here, it could not be originated at initiative
                            of board. Because of undesirability both of frequent small changes in
                            rate and of too drastic an adjustment at one stroke in view of possible
                            adverse internal repercussions, suggest rate to aim at is 40 <hi
                                rend="italic">fapi</hi> to one United States dollar. Striking at
                            even that rate which would still leave <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> over
                            valued, might be difficult of attainment. [Adler.]</p>

                            preferred an outright subsidy to United States Army in China. With
                            respect to latter he said external value of Chinese currency has
                            attained lowest point in history; any further reduction in rate would
                            render it valueless. The only concession he would consider was to

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose as of
                            possible interest to the Department, copies of memoranda<note n="95"
                                xml:id="d437fn1">None printed.</note> on the price problem in China
                            prepared for the Chinese Government by Dr. Arthur N. Young, the American
                            advisor to the Ministry of Finance, who, in making the copies available
                            to me requested that should they be communicated to the Department they
                            be treated as strictly confidential as to their source. I ask that that
                            request be respected.</p>
                        <p>While exact measurements of the price rise in China are difficult because
                            of faults in available data and widely varying conditions, it is
                            conservatively estimated that in Free China the <hi rend="italic"
                                >average</hi> price level is now at least 35 times the 1937 level.
                            The figure for Chungking in August 1942, is given as 5627; while for
                            Kunming, in Yunnan Province, the August level was 9843—the highest
                            recorded in any area. The rate of increase in prices is tending to grow;
                            prices have increased about threefold in the past year. This rate of
                            increase is described as alarming. Dr. Young anticipates that if the
                            rate of increase does not slacken, average prices throughout China will
                            reach 100 times the 1937 level before the summer of 1943 and 200 times
                            that level by the last quarter of 1943. In the memorandum sent as
                            enclosure 1 with this despatch, Dr. Young compares this situation with
                            that which existed in Austria, Germany, Hungary and Russia during and
                            after the First World War. He points out the dangers to be feared from a
                            similar situation in China.</p>
                        <p>Enclosure 1 discusses the combination of causes which has brought about
                            this increasingly dangerous situation in China. Dr. Young states that
                            the total National Government deficit in the first five years of the
                            Sino-Japanese war was $26,470,000,000<note n="*" xml:id="d437fn2"
                                >Chinese currency [Footnote in the original.]</note> while the
                            increase in note issue was $21,568,000,000<note n="*" xml:id="d437fn3"
                                >Chinese currency [Footnote in the original.]</note>—or over 80% of
                            the deficit. Other <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0556"/>chief causes
                            are the issuance of new currencies by the Japanese and their bogus
                            regimes, the shortage of goods, enemy interference with internal trade
                            by seizure and destruction of goods and means of production and by
                            blockade of roads, rivers and railways; and the blockade of
                            international trade.</p>
                        <p>In discussing remedial measures, Dr. Young points out that (1) the best
                            psychological check to inflation in China would be the reopening of
                            Burma, while in China, for example, the recapture of Ichang would reopen
                            the flow of goods over to important inland trade route; (2) there must
                            be every possible curtailment of government expenditure—involving
                            re-examination particularly of the military items in the budget and
                            expenditures on civil projects not essential to the war effort; there
                            should be an efficient and honest tax service; and the sales of bonds
                            and savings certificates should be pushed; (3) the sale of gold might be
                            undertaken on an experimental basis; (4) care should be taken to avoid
                            holding rice and other food supplies off the market; (5) effort should
                            be made to increase the production of essential goods; and (6) there
                            should be a relaxation of restrictions on internal transport.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Young asserts that but little can be expected from measures of price
                            control and he discusses this subject in his second memorandum
                            (enclosure no. 2). Following press reports of price control action in
                            the United States there has been an indication that the Generalissimo
                            desires that similar measures be adopted in China, where the situation
                            is such as to promise no substantial results. China is not organized
                            administratively to permit of the successful employment of the western
                            technique of price control, price ceilings, et cetera.</p>
                        <p>The third memorandum accompanying this despatch has to do with the
                            financial situation in Yunnan, where the price index has reached the
                            highest recorded in any province of Free China (wholesale price index at
                            Kunming in August, 9843; retail price index for September, 11, 908).</p>
                        <p>In my conversations with Dr. Young he has particularly emphasized that
                            the most important measure that can be taken to meet the China situation
                            is the recapture of Burma and the reopening of this route for
                            international trade. This, of course, is a problem involving military
                            considerations the importance of which cannot be overestimated. It is my
                            opinion that while the Japanese may have, for the time being, postponed
                            any projected offensive against India or Australia, they are
                            nevertheless prepared to resist in force any attempt to retake Burma and
                            reopen the land route to China. There are various reports current that
                            consideration is being given to retaking Burma with Chinese and Indian
                            forces from India. Viewed from Chungking, the possibility of success in
                            any such move is remote unless the British can <pb n="547"
                                xml:id="pg_547" facs="0557"/>concentrate an overwhelming force, with
                            naval and air support, for that purpose. Such overwhelming force with
                            necessary naval and air support does not appear to exist at this time in
                            the Indian-Burma theater of the war.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Chinese Government on October 15 opened a week’s campaign to
                            encourage and increase the sale of the above-mentioned bonds and savings
                            certificates. The local press devoted editorials to the subject, and an
                            appeal for the increased sale of the bonds was made to the people by the
                            Bond Solicitation Committee of the Ministry of Finance. That appeal
                            stated that it was the duty of each citizen to the nation at war to buy
                            bonds, that it was to the advantage of the buyer as a means of saving
                            and that it presented a means of hastening the victory. Slogans adopted
                            by the Committee appealed for the purchase of the bonds on the grounds
                            of patriotism, stabilization of prices and currency and the buyer’s own
                            advantage, and emphasized the United States dollar backing for the bonds
                            and the terms of repayment in United States currency.</p>
                        <p>Dr. H. H. Kung, Minister of Finance, in his report to the Third People’s
                            Political Council enumerated as one of the five points toward the
                            accomplishment of which the Ministry of Finance will exert its full
                            efforts the enforcement of compulsory subscription to public bonds in
                            order to effect an equitable distribution of the economic burden and
                            also to absorb floating capital. Editorials in the Chinese press made
                            vague references to the enforcement of compulsory subscription to the
                            bonds, and there has reportedly been much discussion concerning the
                            establishment of some compulsory purchase program. <pb n="548"
                                xml:id="pg_548" facs="0558"/>At the end of the campaign the Bond
                            Solicitation Committee announced its Measures Governing the Solicitation
                            of 1942 Allied Victory Bonds, according to which compulsory purchase of
                            domestic bonds was to be effected by an allotment plan while the sale of
                            the United States dollar bonds and savings certificates was to be
                            continued by solicitation. The allotment plan is to be made applicable
                            only to Chungking, and in view of its complicated provisions is not
                            likely to be effective.</p>
                        <p>The campaign has apparently done little to increase the sale of the bonds
                            and savings certificates, for the total sales of the Savings
                            Certificates up to October 29 were US$5,498,000 or CN$109,960,000. It is
                            impossible to obtain any figures for the sale of the Allied Victory
                            Bonds, but it is understood that the total sales of that issue are
                            approximately CN$10,000,000. The Ministry of Finance is apparently
                            reluctant to release any statistics because of the small sales of these
                            bonds.</p>
                        <p>The sale of the issues secured by the American loan has contributed
                            little as an anti-inflationary measure. It is generally felt that
                            investors who are able to secure considerable profits from commercial
                            transactions under present inflationary conditions are not attracted by
                            the small return to be derived from the interest on these bond issues.
                            The negligible sales of the Allied Victory Bonds is ascribed to the long
                            term thereof, and even the backing provided by the American loan has not
                            served to make these issues sufficiently attractive to Chinese investors
                            to make them invest therein in appreciable quantities. The continued
                            small sale of the bonds and savings certificates may therefore be
                            ascribed primarily to the present opportunity offered investors of
                            obtaining large profits from speculation and commercial transactions and
                            secondarily to the lack of confidence in the Chinese Government’s fiscal
                            policy and the long term of the Allied Victory Bonds.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Joseph Beech was for many years President of the West China Union
                            University at Chengtu, Szechuan, China, and now that he has retired,
                            still retains some connection with that institute.</p>
                        <p>Among other remarks, Dr. Beech said that he felt there was something
                            wrong in a situation which compelled the missionary organizations <pb
                                n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0559"/>in the United States remitting
                            money to the West China Union University to make their remittances
                            through the Bank of China and receive for their drafts between $18 and
                            $19 Chinese national currency, when the same drafts sold in the “black
                            market” would yield in the neighborhood of $100 Chinese national
                            currency. It seemed to him, as a layman, that somebody must be making an
                            unwarranted profit out of funds contributed by Americans for the
                            assistance of the Chinese. For example, Dr. Beech said he had heard of a
                            case where a Chinese was given a draft in American currency to pay his
                            travel expenses from China to the United States and through the
                            assistance of a Chinese friend (presumably in banking circles) had sold
                            the draft, purchased the transportation, and still had American money in
                            his pocket when he arrived in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Beech permitted Mr. Peck to retain a copy of a letter dated October
                            14, 1942,<note n="97" xml:id="d439fn97">Not printed.</note> from Dr.

                        <p>1114. To Adler from Secretary of the Treasury. Information has come into
                            the Treasury that persons in the United States are transferring funds to
                            persons in unoccupied China under General License No. 75 and then
                            sending instructions by letter or cable to these persons in unoccupied
                            China directing them to forward the funds to persons in occupied
                            China.</p>
                        <p>The Treasury is considering whether or not the sending such instructions
                            should be prohibited on the grounds of being contrary to Treasury’s
                            General Ruling No. 11 which prohibits direct and indirect transactions
                            involving trade or communication with the enemy and enemy occupied
                            territory and nationals thereof.</p>

                                the many difficulties resulting from war and invasion.</p>

                                would prefer to have this arrangement continue in effect or whether
                                you would prefer to have it terminated. Of course, if the Government
                                of China does not request its renewal, the 1937 arrangement <pb

                            should be made at the black market rather than the official rates. I
                            doubt that he would get very far with either the Treasury or the Chinese
                            Ministry of Finance with any such argument.</p>
                        <p>Telegrams from China over the past few months indicate that the present
                            official rate of approximately 20 yuan to the dollar overvalues the yuan
                            by at least 100% and possibly by 200 or 300%. Naturally this is a very
                            unhappy state of affairs for foreigners in China. The situation came
                            first to FD’s attention in a telegram to the <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552"
                                facs="0562"/>Secretary of the Treasury from Currie, dated July 31,
                            1942, in which Currie stated that he had indicated informally to Dr.
                            Kung the “growing resentment of our diplomatic and military and
                            charitable organizations over declining purchasing power of United
                            States dollar in China.” Currie raised the question of leaving the
                            official rate untouched but giving a special rate for special purposes
                            and suggested to the Secretary of the Treasury that he make inquiry of
                                Adler<note n="*" xml:id="d444fn2">American alternate on the
                                Stabilization Board of China [Footnote in the original].</note> what
                            if anything was being considered. Treasury requested Adler for a report
                            and since early in August there have been a number of interchanges of
                            telegrams on the subject. Adler has indicated that a rate of 40 yuan to
                            the dollar would “very roughly” approximate the purchasing power of the
                            United States dollar in China to that of a year ago. Adler has remarked
                            that both the United States Government officials and missionaries have
                            found that their living expenses doubled.</p>
                        <p>Apparently Adler has found in conversations with Kung that the Chinese
                            Government is strongly opposed to special rates of exchange as suggested
                            by Currie. Kung is also skeptical of the desirability of a substantial
                            reduction in the official rate. Adler has reported that Kung prefers an
                            outright subsidy to the United States army in China to the institution
                            of a special rate and was reluctant to consider any concessions other
                            than continued winking at black market sales of U. S. currency notes.
                            Apparently such sales of notes are largely by army personnel.</p>
                        <p>It would appear from the foregoing that the plight of the missionaries
                            and charitable organizations is bound up with major Chinese financial
                            questions such as the proper official rate for the yuan, control of
                            black market operations, etc., which are currently being discussed
                            between the Chinese Treasury and our own Treasury. Mr. Friedman of the
                            Treasury informs me that it is his impression that the Chinese are
                            relatively indifferent to the plight of the charitable organizations. It
                            would appear to FD somewhat dubious that the plight of such
                            organizations should be made a controlling factor in the situation. A
                            decision to devalue the yuan further is a complicated question which
                            presumably must be decided on broader grounds. Kung apparently feels
                            that since there is so little trade the psychological ill effects of
                            devaluation of the yuan or the institution of a broad system of special
                            rates may well offset the advantages of further devaluation.</p>
                        <p>FD believes that if RC<note n="99" xml:id="d444fn3">Division of Cultural

                        <p>1425. Following information from British Financial Attaché (Hall-Patch)
                            who is leaving soon for London en route thence to Washington:
                            Negotiations for utilization of the British credit of 50 million pounds
                            have been at a standstill for some time. Chinese have made proposals
                            unacceptable to the British because inconsonant with British requirement
                            that credit be used for purchases within [sterling area?] and for the
                            period of the war only. Recently Wellington Koo<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d445fn1">Chinese Ambassador in the United Kingdom.</note>
                            made a “personal” approach to British Embassy with the knowledge of the
                            Minister of Finance suggesting (1) credit be used to finance transfer of
                            ships and machinery to China when near conclusion of war made it evident
                            that Britain could spare ships and machinery useful to China, or (2)
                            credit be used to take over loans to China secured on the Chinese
                            customs. Neither proposition it appears was acceptable to the British,
                            and no agreement has been reached for using the loan. Soong is
                            non-communicative on the subject but hope is entertained that, when he
                            makes his reported visit to London after his return to Washington, he
                            may be able to work out a practical arrangement.</p>

                                    remittances to occupied territory as long as they are made via
                                    unoccupied China for following reasons: (1) Foreign exchange
                                    does not fall into enemy hands, (2) remittances have succeeded
                                    to maintain circulation of <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> in
                                    occupied areas in which enemy is trying to prohibit both the
                                    receipt of remittances from unoccupied China and the circulation
                                    of <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi>. Moreover enemy acquired so much
                                        <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> in Shanghai and elsewhere that
                                    there is no question of such remittances increasing Japanese
                                    supply of <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> to an undesirable extent.
                                    (3) In many areas in Kwangtung enemy occupies only towns and
                                    communication points but not countryside to which a substantial
                                    part of remittances are sent. (4) He states overseas Chinese

                        <p>Section I: Economic situation in Northwest.</p>
                        <p>1. Kansu and Sinkiang, previously two of most backward provinces of
                            China, have made considerable economic progress in recent <pb n="555"
                                xml:id="pg_555" facs="0565"/>years. In Kansu, Central Government has
                            initiated forestation, irrigation, and animal husbandry projects, and a
                            number of industrial plants have been opened, both by Government and
                            private enterprise, of which most striking is Central Government’s
                            opening of Yumen oil field this year. It is now producing 250,000
                            gallons per month, gasoline having octane content of 40–45; main problem
                            lack of refining equipment and drums. In Sinkiang, Provincial
                            Government, apparently with Soviet assistance, has made substantial
                            advances in improving breeds of livestock and quality of wheat and
                            cotton, and in conjunction with private enterprise has made a start in
                            developing a few light industries. Last year Tusan oil field began
                            production; output now 150 tons crude oil a day. Acute shortage of
                            imported goods in both provinces. There has recently been an increasing
                            tendency for both Provincial Government authorities to introduce
                            regulation and control of private trade and industry to an extent which
                            has already had unfavorabe repercussions in Kansu and which may do so in
                            Sinkiang.</p>

                                    still lower in rural areas, as all large cities constitute
                                    “pockets of inflation”. Even so, Lanchow prices over three times
                                    higher than in November, 1941. Retail prices in Lanchow, October
                                    1942: general, 4300; food, 3420 (Farmer’s Bank, January–June
                                    equals 100). Rate of increase from July to October, 15 to 20%
                                    per month. Prices of imported goods have risen most and of goods

                                <item>Operation of Kansu Provincial Government price control,
                                    initiated 2 years ago, presents a discouraging picture of
                                    excessive mercantilist regulations cramping individual
                                    initiative. Nine commodities controlled, and their official
                                    prices often set below cost of production to manufacturers and
                                    cost of purchase to merchants. Authorities have confiscated
                                    large stocks of goods—sometimes on minor technicalities—without
                                    releasing them to market; thus Bank of China had, in dollars, 70
                                    million of goods confiscated from its go-downs 4 months ago, but
                                    they were merely transferred to Provincial Government go-downs.
                                    Result is that private factories are curtailing production,
                                    banks curtailing loans, and merchants moving their capital to
                                    less controlled area with consequent intensification of wartime
                                    scarcities. Control fully operative only in Lanchow.</item>

                                    fixed at 3.20 to the United States dollar for trade purposes
                                    with Russia, no United States dollars actually being used. At
                                    end of October 1942 by agreement between Dr. Kung and Governor
                                    Shen, Sinkiang dollar fixed at SK dollars 4 equals 1 customs
                                    gold unit note (i. e. 20 <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi>), which was
                                    admitted into circulation in Sinkiang for first time; this rate
                                    undervalues SK dollar sign. It was also agreed that Central Bank
                                    should open branch in Tihwa (Urumchi) in near future. Amount of
                                    SK dollar sign in circulation reported in Chungking to be SK
                                    dollar sign 32 million but this may be underestimate. Provincial

                                that China be permitted to purchase for earmarking $50 million of
                                gold out of the $300 million still remaining to the credit of China
                                on the books of the Treasury. Dr. Kung has indicated that he might
                                agree to 30 or 40 million dollars of gold, if the Treasury so
                                desires. The Treasury is now considering this proposal and would

                                issued by the Chinese Government on March 24, 1942

                        <p>2. There is some confusion here as to status both of savings certificates
                            at time of maturity and of checks or drafts which it is intended to
                            issue in lieu of or in exchange for savings certificates when they are
                            presented in New York at due date. Some quarters in Chinese Government
                            feel (it would appear to me mistakenly) that both certificates and
                            checks or drafts would not be frozen in view of general license 60, (2).
                            In view of subsequent telegram with respect to applicability of general
                            license 60, (2), general ruling number 5, and public circular number 2
                            and in view of fact that banks are holding up printing of checks and
                            drafts pending clarification of their status, replies to following
                            questions would be appreciated: <list>

                        <p>3. Chinese Government shares your view that transactions described in
                            number 1 of your 1082<note n="5" xml:id="d449fn5">November 14, 3 p.m.,

                            would appreciate your assistance through use of general ruling number 5.
                            I am informed that Bank of China, Kunming, had sold $100,000 of savings
                            certificates to American nationals (presumably mostly soldiers) up to
                            the beginning of November. From a number of inquiries it would appear
                            that the scale on which American nationals outside Kunming have bought
                            certificates is quite small, partly due to lack of confidence in their
                            convertibility in New York.</p>
                        <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0569"/>
                        <p>I fully agree with you on undesirability of such transactions and suggest
                            that the matter be taken up with the War Department in Washington. It
                            should be noted that contemplated issue of checks or drafts in lieu of
                            or in exchange for certificates might complicate problem of control.</p>
                        <p>4. For your information, a number of established foreign business houses
                            have been purchasing saving certificates with <hi rend="italic"
                                >fapi</hi> acquired in the normal course of business. It is felt
                            that such purchases are different in character from purchases of
                            certificates made by residents of the United States temporarily in China
                            before their departure, but your opinion on their desirability would be
                            appreciated. [Adler.]</p>

                            of currency notes plus allowance for traveling expenses. This regulation
                            was subsequently abrogated as Chinese Government wished to encourage
                            movement of <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> into occupied areas, and there
                            are at present no restrictions. As there is some movement of United

                            purposes, revival of the old regulation with respect to foreign
                            currencies would appear to be in order.</p>

                            Conversations with Dr. Kung and Ministry of Finance officials reveal
                            that on the whole they feel that black market for United States dollar
                            notes could and should be dried up by cessation of their import by the
                            United States Air Force in China. They themselves do not want to take
                            initiative, as they realize that existence of the black market acts as
                            safety valve for the United States Air Force’s vocal discontent with
                            official exchange rate. But my impression is that they would
                            nevertheless welcome remedial action by United States authorities.</p>
                        <p>My own view is that such action should be taken especially as American
                            soldiers’ recourse to black market is leading to ugly rumors and to bad
                            feeling on part of British soldiers who receive their allowances only in
                                <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> converted at official rate. Main
                            drawback to prohibition of United States Air Force import of United
                            States dollar notes is that it would remove safety valve for Army’s
                            dissatisfaction with official rate. But on the other hand: <list>

                            <item>In a conversation with me this morning Dr. Kung after some
                                background discussion said he was willing to renew the 1937
                                arrangement unconditionally and to accept any decision you make as
                                to the amount of gold China should purchase for the Treasury,
                                whether it be 20, 30, 40 or 50 million dollars. The reason he had
                                suggested 50 million was that as that was the amount purchased in
                                1937 on your advice he would like to retain the same sum on earmark
                                primarily <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0573"/>as a friendly
                                gesture to you but also to have China’s gold holdings on the same
                                level as in 1937. Throughout the conversation it was apparent that
                                he was most anxious to cooperate fully with the Treasury.</item>

                            <item>Dr. Kung made no reference to possible need for importing gold in
                                conjunction with the scheme for establishing free gold market here,
                                a question which I understand is still pending.</item>

                            <item>China still has 10 million dollars unobligated gold in New York.
                                She could therefore bring her gold holdings in New York up to 50
                                million by purchasing 40 million gold from the Treasury. This
                                purchase could be made entirely independently of renewal of 1937
                                arrangement. [Adler.]</item>

                                decision which the Treasury may wish to make as to the amount of
                                gold China should purchase from the Treasury, whether it be 20, 30,
                                40, or 50 million dollars. In view of the considerations given
                                below, the Treasury feels that the already agreed-to U. S. $20
                                million would be the more appropriate amount. <list>

                                        would require the raising of funds by the U. S. Treasury
                                        with which to purchase the additional gold. The U. S.
                                        Government would have to pay interest on these funds at a

                        <p>Secretary Morgenthau announced that the stabilization arrangement of July
                            14, 1937 under which the Central Bank of China has been enabled to
                            obtain up to 50 million in U. S. dollar exchange has been extended for a
                            period of six months beyond December 31, 1942.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Morgenthau also announced that the Government of China had
                            completely liquidated all obligations which it had incurred in the past
                            under the 1937 arrangement. China’s favorable record under this
                            arrangement, the Secretary declared, was another example of China’s
                            creditable dealings with the United States.</p>

                    <p>At his press conference last Friday, Mr. Welles<note n="2" xml:id="d457fn2"
                            >Sumner Welles, Under Secretary of State.</note> was asked whether there
                        are any prospects of concluding a lend-lease agreement with China in the
                        near future and Mr. Welles’ reply was non-committal.</p>
                    <p>This suggests that immediate consideration should be given to negotiating a
                        lend-lease agreement with China along the lines of the agreement with the
                        United Kingdom signed on February 23.<note n="3" xml:id="d457fn3">Department

                        setting forth in general terms why it is believed that all lend-lease
                        agreements should so far as practicable be similar to the British lend-lease
                        agreement. It is believed that these general principles are fully applicable
                        in the case of China. Particularly it is believed that the terms of a master
                        lend-lease agreement with China, in view of the importance of that country’s
                        role in the war, should be no less favorable than the terms of the British
                        agreement.</p>

                    <p>It was generally agreed that a lend-lease agreement with China on the British
                        model would be desirable and that TA should collaborate with DE in preparing
                        a draft of such an agreement. This draft is attached.<note n="11"

                    <p>Mr. Johnson raised the question whether payments to China for strategic
                        materials exported to this country might be precluded by the proposed
                        agreement, thereby interfering with the procurement of such materials. He
                        was assured that such payments would not be precluded.</p>
                    <p>It will be noted that the second paragraph of the preamble of the attached
                        draft agreement with China does not appear in the British lend-lease
                        agreement. This paragraph appears in the attached draft as it was
                        recommended for inclusion in the master lend-lease agreement with Australia

                        whether the specific reference to the Atlantic Charter in this paragraph
                        would be appropriate in a lend-lease agreement with China, since China is
                        not an Atlantic power and since there has been some talk of a “Pacific
                        Charter”. It was suggested that this question might be avoided by dropping
                        the last part of the paragraph, beginning with the words “embodied in the
                        Joint Declaration …”</p>
                    <p>From the point of view of this Government the question of the scope of the
                        Atlantic Charter was raised, and answered by the President, on January 2,
                        the day following signature of the United Nations Declaration. The President
                        replied to a question at his press conference <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568"
                            facs="0578"/>that day, in regard to a possible pact relating to the
                        Pacific, to the effect that the Atlantic Charter covered the whole world
                        (Department’s Radio Bulletin No. 1, January 2). The President is also
                        reported to have said that the Charter got its name only from the place of
                        its signature. The language of the Charter itself, of course, indicates that
                        it is world-wide rather than regional in scope.</p>
                    <p>From the Chinese point of view there would seem to be no reason to believe
                        that any serious question would be raised by that Government in regard to
                        the specific reference to the Atlantic Charter in the preamble of the
                        proposed lend-lease agreement. The language of the entire last part of the
                        proposed paragraph, beginning with the words “subscribed to a common program
                        …”, is identical to the language of the preamble of the United Nations
                        Declaration which was signed for China by her Foreign Minister.<note n="14"
                            xml:id="d458fn14">T. V. Soong.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>It seems highly desirable that this paragraph be included in the lend-lease
                        agreement with China, and in all lend-lease agreements with signatories of
                        the United Nations Declaration, in order to emphasize by reiteration the
                        importance which our Government and “other governments of like mind” attach
                        to the principles of the Charter, and in order to reemphasize that the
                        principles of the Charter are not in any sense limited in geographic scope.
                        It may be added that the addition of this paragraph does not represent a
                        difference of substance as compared with the British agreement; the British
                        Prime Minister was one of the two original signers of the Atlantic Charter
                        and there was therefore no need to include such a reference in the preamble
                        of our agreement with the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>A question was raised by Mr. Currie in Mr. Hamilton’s office as to the
                        appropriateness in the case of China of the reference to the “reduction of
                        tariffs” which occurs at the end of the first paragraph of Article VII of
                        the British lend-lease agreement and the attached draft of the proposed
                        agreement with China. This question was raised by Mr. Currie on the ground
                        that China may have a great industrial development after the war and may
                        wish in this connection to impose tariffs as a means of protecting her
                        infant industries in that period. He felt that a commitment by China in
                        regard to the “reduction of tariffs” might, as a result of pressure by
                        American exporters, tend to become a cause of irritation between the two
                        Governments and even preclude the imposition of tariffs by China to protect
                        her infant industries.</p>
                    <p>The “infant industry” argument in support of protective tariffs is virtually
                        as old as the tariff question itself and has led more often than not to
                        excessive protection of inefficient industries. Presumably, however, Mr.
                        Currie did not have in mind that it would be in China’s interest <pb n="569"
                            xml:id="pg_569" facs="0579"/>to impose excessive tariffs which would
                        unduly burden that country’s consumers and her foreign trade.</p>
                    <p>It is not believed that the words which Mr. Currie questioned would in any
                        sense preclude the imposition by China of such tariffs as were not excessive
                        or discriminatory and this was pointed out to him. It was also pointed out
                        that Article VII is not in itself conclusive; on the contrary, it lays down
                        broad principles which require implementation. As Mr. Hamilton has
                        subsequently indicated, the second paragraph of Article VII deals with the
                        question of implementation and states specifically that the best means of
                        attaining the desired objectives shall be determined “in the light of
                        governing economic conditions.” Such factors as the future industrialization
                        of China would of course be taken into account in any discussions or
                        negotiations for the purpose of implementing the principles laid down in
                        Article VII; for example, the Chinese Government has recently and in the
                        past expressed an interest in negotiating a trade agreement with the United
                        States. It was pointed out to Mr. Currie in this connection, that Article
                        VII, being reciprocal in its terms, would commit this Government in
                        principle to the reduction of its tariffs and that this commitment would be
                        desirable from the Chinese point of view, particularly since that Government
                        has expressed an interest in trade agreement negotiations. Under our trade
                        agreement policy, in return for concessions granted by this country, we
                        would seek reductions or bindings of Chinese tariffs only on products of
                        particular interest to us; in regard to other tariffs we would seek only
                        nondiscriminatory treatment.</p>
                    <p>Finally, it was pointed out that the omissions of a reciprocal commitment
                        involving the possibility of tariff reductions from the proposed lend-lease
                        agreement with China would be open to misunderstanding and misinterpretation
                        which would in all probability have a more serious and permanent adverse
                        effect on our relations with China than the inclusion of this commitment
                        could possibly have.</p>

                    <p>In order to meet Mr. Currie’s point, however, I suggest the following brief
                        statement which might, if desired by the Chinese, even be made the subject
                        of an exchange of notes at the time of the signature of the agreement:

                            <p>The proposed agreement is in the same terms as similar agreements
                                between the United States of America and others of the United
                                Nations. Article VII makes reference to reduction of tariffs. It is
                                recognized that the tariffs in effect in China are already, in
                                general, low. General reductions in Chinese tariffs are therefore
                                not expected, and some increases may be appropriate. All these
                                matters are to be the subject of further discussion and agreement,
                                as Article VII indicates, to the end that production and employment
                                in both countries may be expanded by increased trade in both
                                directions between them, and between each of them and other

                    <p>It is suggested that you ask the Counselor of the Chinese Embassy (Mr. Liu
                        Chieh) (the Ambassador is absent and will be away until June 2) to call and
                        that you hand to the Counselor the ribbon copy, with one carbon, of the
                        attached draft of a proposed lend-lease agreement between the United States
                        and China.<note n="18" xml:id="d460fn18">Draft not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In so doing it is suggested that you might care to inform the Counselor that
                        with the exception of a few minor phraseological changes the draft follows
                        the language of the lend-lease agreement concluded between the United States
                        and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with only one
                        substantive change, namely, the inclusion of one additional statement which
                        appears as the second “Whereas” clause. This new “Whereas” clause takes
                        cognizance of and makes express reference to the Declaration by United
                        Nations and the declaration known as the Atlantic Charter. This Government
                        proposes, because of its obvious political significance, to include it in
                        all further lend-lease agreements. You might hand the Counselor a copy of
                        the text of the agreement with the British Government (copy attached).</p>
                    <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0581"/>
                    <p>You might inform the Counselor also that this Government has desired to
                        include the Chinese Government among the first Governments which we have
                        approached in the matter.</p>
                    <p>You might inform the Counselor that officers of the Department will be
                        available to confer with officers of the Embassy at any time in regard to
                        any technical aspects of the draft and you might suggest that I will hold
                        myself in readiness to arrange such a conference upon receipt of word from
                        the Chinese Embassy that such a conference is desired.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Liu Chieh, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy, telephoned. He referred to
                        the text of a proposed lend-lease agreement between the United States and
                        China, a draft of which the Secretary of State handed to Dr. T. V. Soong and
                        to him on May 27.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Liu said that Dr. Soong had received a telegram from Generalissimo Chiang
                        Kai-shek authorizing Dr. Soong to sign as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Dr.
                        Soong suggested that the agreement be signed tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>I said that I understood from this that the text as presented to Dr. Soong
                        and Mr. Liu Chieh on May 27 was satisfactory to the Chinese Government. Mr.
                        Liu replied in the affirmative.</p>
                    <p>I commented further that the Chinese Government had acted in this matter with
                        gratifying speed. I said that I did not know whether <pb n="572"

                    <p>Mr. Hayter<note n="6" xml:id="d464fn6">First Secretary of the British
                            Embassy.</note> of the British Embassy called at his request. He said
                        that he wished to communicate information in regard to a situation <pb
                            n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0584"/>which had been unpleasant but which
                        had ended satisfactorily. He then proceeded to say that, some time ago when
                        the S. S. <hi rend="italic">Tulsa</hi> was at Rangoon, the Governor of Burma
                        had information indicating the likelihood of an imminent Japanese air
                        attack; that consequently the Governor of Burma felt it important that the
                            <hi rend="italic">Tulsa</hi>, which carried American Lend-Lease goods
                        consigned to China, be unloaded as rapidly as feasible and that the goods be
                        not left on the wharves but be transported promptly to some inland place
                        where they would be less exposed to Japanese air attack; that Colonel
                        Twitty, American Army officer at Rangoon, had been consulted by the Governor
                        and had expressed agreement; that it was very difficult to get in touch with
                        representatives of the Chinese Government; that the only Chinese official
                        with authority and a willingness to make decisions was ill; and that the
                        Lend-Lease goods of the <hi rend="italic">Tulsa</hi> were by order of the
                        Governor unloaded from the <hi rend="italic">Tulsa</hi> and removed inland.
                        Mr. Hayter continued that the Chinese Government and Chiang Kai-shek, when
                        they heard of this, had been quite upset; that T. V. Soong<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d464fn7">Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> here had
                        seen Prime Minister Churchill; and that Prime Minister Churchill had sent
                        out telegrams in regard to the matter.</p>
                    <p>I commented that from the reports which I had seen of the case it was my
                        recollection that there had been involved Lend-Lease materials in addition
                        to those on the S. S. <hi rend="italic">Tulsa</hi> and that these Lend-Lease
                        materials had been taken over by the British. Mr. Hayter was rather vague on
                        this point. He mentioned that General Brett<note n="8" xml:id="d464fn8">Maj.
                            Gen. George H. Brett, Chief of U. S. Air Corps.</note> and General
                            Wavell<note n="9" xml:id="d464fn9">British Commander in Chief in
                            India.</note> had been passing through Rangoon about this time and that
                        they had indicated concurrence in the procedure adopted by the Governor of
                        Burma. Mr. Hayter said that the American Army officers in Burma had
                        indicated a willingness to go farther in the matter of taking action with
                        reference to China Lend-Lease supplies than the Governor of Burma.</p>
                    <p>I told Mr. Hayter that this Government’s attitude was that Lend-Lease
                        supplies consigned to China should go forward to China and that no
                        interference or diversion of such supplies should be made except after and
                        on the basis of full consultation with the Chinese Government. Mr. Hayter
                        said that that also represented the attitude and policy of the British
                        Government. He said that the British Government had sent instructions to the
                        British Ambassador at Chungking to inform Chiang Kai-shek that the British
                        Government would of course not interfere with Lend-Lease supplies consigned
                        to China, except in a case of great emergency where the safety of the
                        supplies or the safety of a situation of vital interest to all was urgently
                        involved. <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0585"/>I commented that we
                        thought it very important that the Chinese Government be treated in every
                        way possible as a full equal and that it seemed preferable to me, rather
                        than to state an exception in the way which Mr. Hayter had outlined, to
                        suggest some affirmative measure which would take care of a vital emergency
                        situation. I said that I understood that our Army authorities had suggested
                        to Chiang Kai-shek that he arrange to have some representative in Burma who
                        could, in the event of there developing an acute emergency situation, confer
                        on behalf of Chiang Kai-shek with appropriate British and American officers
                        there and make decisions. Mr. Hayter said that that was also their idea.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hayter concluded by saying that yesterday afternoon T. V. Soong had told
                        him that he now considered the matter closed.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Hayter telephoned to Mr. Mackay and, after referring to his conversation
                        with Mr. Hamilton on January 15 in regard to the attitude of the British
                        authorities in Burma toward American Lend-Lease supplies consigned to China,
                        said that as the Chinese Government had been made aware of the various
                        factors which had occasioned the removal by the British authorities of
                        Lend-Lease supplies consigned <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0586"/>to
                        China, and as in consequence thereof misunderstanding and ill-feeling on the
                        part of the Chinese had been dissipated, the British Government, contrary to
                        its original intention, had decided that it was no longer necessary or
                        advisable to approach General Chiang Kai-shek in regard to the matter and
                        that therefore no such approach would be made.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Mackay thanked Mr. Hayter for bringing this development to the attention

                        via India can be maintained by air.</p>
                    <p>The whole plan seems altogether practical and I am sure we can make it a
                        reality in the near future. Roosevelt.”</p>

                                cause. Second, if planes necessary to defend India, etc., why not
                                take from lot assigned to Russia or Britain who are receiving
                                thousands from America instead of from paltry few designated for

                            B. McCabe, Deputy Lend-Lease Administrator.</note> We are glad to hear
                        of your safe arrival in Chungking.</p>
                    <p>In view of the critical shipping situation from India to China, the large
                        amount of material in storage in India and the increasing stockpile in the
                        United States, it has been necessary to reassign all standard and critical
                        material and equipment originally earmarked for China for immediate use by
                        our own and other allied forces. This has been carried out for all
                        Lend-Lease material. Tires and tubes for existing vehicles in China and
                        2,366 tons of oils and lubricants are to be held in storage for shipping at
                        the earliest possible moment. Arsenal material, except copper which has been
                        reassigned to the War Department for the fabrication of 7.92 mm and other
                        ammunition, is to be held in storage until either there is a critical need
                        for it by our own forces or routes are opened for shipment to China. Cotton
                        goods and blankets are likewise to be held in storage for China. All
                        tractors procured for China have been released to the War Department for
                        reassignment.</p>
                    <p>War Department procured items have been reassigned elsewhere by the War
                        Department and a 3,500 tons a month program for China has been substituted.
                        Third and fourth quarter allocation of raw materials for China have been
                        made with the understanding they will not <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583"
                            facs="0593"/>be claimed unless shipment into China can be made. Such
                        items as tire retreading plants and oil reclaiming plants are the only
                        orders being expedited through Treasury Procurement.</p>
                    <p>Cash purchases for China have been limited to items of direct military
                        importance. All orders already placed are to take their normal course
                        through production without an increase of ratings, until such time as routes
                        are open or Air freight facilities are increased.”</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Alling</hi>: Sometime ago, it was brought
                        to our notice that, on account of the current shipping shortage and its
                        effect on the United States programme of aid to China, the Administration
                        wished us to consider the practicability of supplying some of China’s needs
                        from resources in areas closer to China. The examples of materials that
                        could thus be supplied were saltpetre, acetone, benzol, glycerine, asphalt
                        and tar, tyres and tubes, leather, shellac, canvas duck and webbing, mica,
                        cement, linseed oil, iron and steel products. India being one of the areas
                        near to China, I made inquiries from my Government as to the extent to which
                        they had already helped or could help. They have informed me that the
                        Chinese already have a Purchasing Agency in India, representative of A. J.
                        Bell of the Peking Syndicate, through which orders for textiles, canvas and
                        cotton yarn, of the aggregate value of 1¼ million pounds sterling have
                        already been placed in India. In addition, the Government of India have
                        supplied small quantities of textiles machinery and accessories of paper
                        machinery, chemicals and drugs, mica, graphite, brass sheets, paints and
                        varnishes, emery cloth, copper wire, manila ropes and sundry machinery. In
                        addition, the needs of the Chinese Government are under constant
                        investigation of Mr. Bell in close co-ordination with the Supply Department
                        of the Government of India and India would be able to supply shellac,
                        cement, linseed oil, leather other than of the higher qualities and limited
                        quantities of leather belting, insulated copper wire and bensol. Acetone,
                        glycerine, asphalt, tar, tyres and tubes, iron and steel products are not,
                        unfortunately, available. I am passing on this information as it may prove
                        of some interest to you.</p>

                    <p>845. I learn from a reliable source that Central Broadcasting Administration
                        has sent a long telegram to T. V. Soong requesting assistance in obtaining
                        15 million United States dollars worth of radio equipment under Lend-Lease.
                        Message is stated to have been sent by Chen Kuo Fu, head of Administration,
                        and to have had the approval of Wang Shih Chieh, Minister of Information of
                        Kuomintang. Chen Kuo Fu is one of leaders of so-called “CC”<note n="27"
                            xml:id="d477fn27">Chen brothers, Chen Li-fu and Chen Kuo-fu.</note>
                        clique, the reactionary wing of the party.</p>
                    <p>I am told the administration now has adequate equipment in use and in reserve
                        and the request being made is designed to provide equipment for political
                        use after war, advantage being taken of Lend-Lease to obtain additional
                        equipment at this time without cost.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that if this request is put forward by Soong it should be
                        referred to Chungking for checkup before action thereon is taken. A survey
                        of actual needs could be made by Lusey or Brown, radio engineers sent out by
                            COI<note n="28" xml:id="d477fn28">Coordinator of Information.</note>
                        Lusey at present in East China and Brown has not yet arrived but both of

                    <p>878. For McCabe from Ray. Replying to your 657, July 22.</p>
                    <p>1. There is serious need for arsenal materials in China second only to acute
                        need for supplies for maintenance of and expansion of American air force.
                        Visits to seven representative arsenals and three talks with General Yu Ta
                        Wei convince me that arsenal materials need for rest of 1942 can be almost
                        completely met by (1st) using inventories now at arsenal and (2d) moving
                        supplies now at Yunnan to the arsenal.</p>
                    <p>2. Priority on air freight movement into China of CDS supplies as distinct
                        from American Army supplies are set by the Chinese Board per my last
                        telegram. As stated therein first priority has been assigned to rifle
                        powder, copper, zinc, and bullet cups, all for making small arms ammunition.
                        None of these items shipped into China during July as all available eastward
                        space devoted to supplies and personnel for American air force here. This
                        condition is likely to continue during third quarter.</p>
                    <p>Present stocks of priority arsenal materials in India appear sufficient for
                        several months of freight movement into China when started. You may
                        therefore wish to resume shipment of arsenal materials from America to
                        replenish stockpile in India only when movements into China have commenced
                        which is unlikely before October.</p>
                    <p>3. Forecast of air transport space available to move CDS supplies into China
                        is impossible because of unpredictability of space to be preempted by
                        American air force supplies.</p>
                    <p>(Greater strategic importance of latter causes constant pressure to expand
                        same despite resulting postponement of arsenal material shipments!)</p>
                    <p>4. Will report actual July air freight movements by Army and CNAC<note n="32"

                    <p>Mr. Ashley Clarke of the Foreign Office sent a letter to Dr. Hornbeck on July
                            7th<note n="33" xml:id="d480fn33">Stanley K. Hornbeck, Adviser on
                            Political Relations; letter not found in Department files.</note> in
                        which, among other things, he referred to the question of air communications
                        between India and China. In this letter Mr. Clarke said that the Foreign
                        Office were still awaiting further details about the rate at which the
                        transport aircraft carrying supplies between India and China were actually
                        operating.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Clarke has now written to the Embassy saying that some further
                        information on the subject has been received from India which would seem to
                        indicate that the quantities of supplies to be carried will be slightly
                        higher than those previously indicated by General Brereton. Mr. Clarke has
                        suggested that the State Department might be interested to have this
                        additional information. It is to the following effect.</p>
                    <p>The total number of aircraft operating at present is twenty-one, including
                        twelve of the United States of America Ferry Command. Flights have been
                        irregular owing to monsoon conditions. By the end of the year it is
                        estimated that possibly seventy-five aircraft of the Ferry Command will be
                        operating plus twenty-five to be operated by C. N. A. C. with a frequency of
                        one trip per aircraft per day.</p>
                    <p>The freight for China consists of war stores ordered according to priorities
                        laid down by General Stilwell. Exact tonnage figures are not available, but
                        air headquarters in India estimate that the present twenty-one aircraft when
                        fully employed could carry 130 tons per week during the monsoon, while after
                        the monsoon twelve tons per aircraft per week would be a reasonable target.
                        The freight which is at present being carried from China to India consists
                        of tin and tungsten.</p>
                    <p>The main factors at present limiting the development of the service are the
                        monsoon conditions and signal facilities, which are, however, now being
                        improved. As regards aerodromes, it is hoped that if expected progress is
                        made in construction the aerodrome capacity should be sufficient for the
                        estimated number of aircraft.</p>
                    <p>In his letter to the Embassy Mr. Clarke pointed out that it may well be that
                        more up-to-date or more exact figures and estimates are in the possession of
                        the United States authorities. Should that be the case the Foreign Office
                        would be very interested to be informed of these figures. The Foreign Office
                        would also, Mr. Clarke emphasises, be very glad to know if there are any
                        ways in which the State Department think that they could assist in this
                        question of improving the means of air communication between India and
                        China.</p>

                    <p>Reference is made to the British Embassy’s memorandum of August 10, 1942 in
                        regard to the question of air communications between India and China.</p>
                    <p>It is the understanding of this Department that operating conditions on the
                        India-China route are subject to so many vicissitudes of weather and
                        military and other developments that statistics in regard to these
                        operations are subject to frequent change. We are informed that the United
                        States Army Ferry Command supplies current reports to the United States War
                        Department and that these reports are available to the Combined Chiefs of
                        Staff.</p>
                    <p>The Department has noted the Embassy’s statement that the Foreign Office
                        would be very glad to know if there are any ways in which this Department
                        considers that the Foreign Office could assist in the question of improving
                        the means of air communication between India and China. Although the
                        question of assuring adequate supplies to China involves primarily
                        considerations of a military nature, it is believed that officials concerned
                        with Far Eastern political relations can be of considerable assistance to
                        the military and other agencies which are most directly charged with
                        responsibility in this matter. In our opinion, the furnishing of supplies to
                        China through India is a matter of important significance to the war effort
                        of the United Nations and constitutes a problem the solution of which
                        involves continuing and increasing cooperative effort among this Government,
                        the British Government, the Government of India, and the Chinese
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>The cooperative spirit manifested in the British Embassy’s memorandum under
                        reference is appreciated.</p>

                        received numerous requests from various agencies in China to ship cash
                        purchase material now being stored here to India. Although tonnage involved
                        is greatly in excess of air transport capacity each agency has assured us
                        that it will be able to arrange air transport into China.</p>
                    <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0598"/>
                    <p>Will it be possible, in China, to investigate the possibility of clearing all
                        such requests through a central agency or through Air Transport Priority
                        Board for approval subject to limitations of emergency air program?</p>
                    <p>It is the policy of the War Department that unless it can be put into
                        operational use in the near future no stock pile of material shall be
                        accumulated in India. We follow War Department’s policy. Before additional
                        indirect military supplies will be shipped from the U. S. we must receive
                        indications of ability to move material into China. This is necessary in
                        view of the large stockpile in India.</p>
                    <p>Will you be able to supply information regarding Air Priority Board as
                        follows: 1—Membership; 2—How it functions; 3—General priority list?</p>

                    <p>We are interested in having accurate monthly reports covering air cargo
                        shipments between China and India with an indication of the type of cargo.
                        From what source can we get this information?</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose for the
                        information of the Department, copy of a confidential memorandum submitted
                        to me by Mr. John S. Service, Third Secretary of the Embassy, reporting
                        observations made during his recent trip to the northwest, on the alleged
                        misuse and misappropriation of lend-lease and relief supplies sent to
                            China.<note n="36" xml:id="d483fn36">Not printed. It reported evidence
                            of Red Cross cloth and quinine being improperly sold, jeeps in use by
                            persons not in military uniform, aviation tools for sale, and lack of
                            care of lend-lease trucks.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Soon after the fall of Burma to the Japanese, it was reported here that in
                        the haste and confusion of evacuating Rangoon and other points in Burma and
                        of endeavoring to move deeper into China the large quantities of lend-lease
                        and relief supplies accumulated at Rangoon and other points—including places
                        inside the Chinese border—quantities of equipment and supplies were
                        abandoned or fell into private hands and were being offered for sale in
                        Kunming and <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0599"/>other places in Free
                        China. It was reported, for example, that lend-lease motor cars, trucks and
                        “jeeps” could be had at Rangoon for the asking or taking, and that all
                        manner of supplies were similarly available to those who could or would move
                        them to prevent their falling into the hands of the Japanese.</p>
                    <p>For a time there was considerable comment and criticism on this subject heard
                        at Chungking; but the Embassy is not in possession of information to confirm
                        that any substantial volume of equipment or supplies came into the
                        possession of private persons. Lend-Lease operations in China at that time
                        were under the supervision of Brigadier General John Magruder, U. S. A.,
                        head of the American Military Mission. No information on the subject was
                        communicated to the Embassy by General Magruder.</p>
                    <p>There have also been reports from time to time that medical supplies provided
                        by the American Red Cross and other American relief organizations have
                        gotten into private hands and were being sold at extortionate prices. The
                        Military Attaché, when he returned recently from a visit to the
                        Chekiang-Kiangsi front, informed me that while there were no medicines or
                        medical supplies for the troops, quinine and such drugs were being sold on
                        the streets of the cities and towns, at very high prices. I know that the
                        American Red Cross and other relief organizations have been alert to the
                        rumors circulating from time to time that medicines intended for relief
                        purposes were being sold privately. I have no doubt that they have taken and
                        will continue to take all possible measures to prevent supplies reaching
                        private hands for sale; and I do not believe that the more responsible
                        Chinese organizations to which supplies are distributed are parties to such
                        misappropriation.</p>
                    <p>In a country such as China, and with large quantities of supplies being
                        handled, it is not surprising that some supplies may be stolen or
                        misappropriated and sold for private gain.</p>
                    <p>In transmitting the enclosed memorandum from Secretary Service, I do not wish
                        to suggest that any serious situation exists as to lend-lease and relief
                        supplies; but it is well to record the reports which have reached the
                        Embassy from time to time as well as the observations made by Mr. Service on
                        his trip to the northwest.</p>
                    <p>In connection with this general subject, I might mention that some months ago
                        the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> local correspondent at Chungking,
                        who is somewhat inclined to exaggeration and to a florid type of reporting,
                        filed a message to his paper stating that lend-lease and relief supplies
                        from Burma were being sold privately in Free China, that steps had been
                        taken by the Chinese authorities to detect the unauthorized possession of
                        such goods, and that the measures taken were so drastic that in Chungking
                        persons appearing in “shorts” <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0600"
                        />fashioned of a cloth supplied only for military purposes were being made
                        by the police publicly to remove the garments and hand them over.</p>
                    <p>This telegram appears to have slipped past the censors and to have been
                        published in New York with a resulting sharp complaint from Dr. T. V. Soong
                        to the Generalissimo. Dr. Hollington Tong, Vice Minister of Information, in
                        charge of press cable censorship, was held accountable for the report having
                        been passed by the censors. Dr. Hollington Tong telephoned to the Embassy
                        and asked that I be informed that he proposed to withdraw the
                        press-telegraph card of the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>
                        correspondent. I advised quietly against any such action, pointing out that
                        the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> was most friendly and favorable to
                        China in its editorial and news policy, and that the withdrawal of
                        facilities accorded to its correspondent would not serve the best interests
                        of China. I suggested that if the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent
                        had transmitted a false report and was unwilling to correct it, the matter
                        might appropriately be taken up with the <hi rend="italic">New York
                            Times</hi> through this Embassy or the Chinese Embassy in Washington. I
                        heard nothing more of the matter. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>
                        correspondent did not approach the Embassy in regard to it, nor was he
                        informed of the approach made by Dr. Tong and the advice given.</p>
                    <p>I cite this incident merely to indicate the supersensitiveness of the Chinese
                        to criticism of misappropriation of lend-lease and relief supplies. Such
                        misappropriation undoubtedly exists, but I am unable to say that it has at
                        any time reached any substantial volume.</p>

                    <p>302. I was informed by the Chinese Ambassador<note n="1" xml:id="d484fn1"
                            >Shao Li-tzu.</note> last evening that his Government has proposed to
                        the Soviet and British Governments that war supplies should be sent into
                        China by way of Iran, the Caspian Sea and the railroad leading therefrom to
                        Tashkent and thence overland via the Urumchi route and that this proposal
                        has also been brought to the attention of our government. He said that
                        inasmuch as the difficulties of transportation by this route are recognized
                        the Chinese Government had limited its request to 4,000 tons of supplies a
                        month.</p>

                    <p>350. My 302, April 10, 2 p.m. The Chinese Ambassador stated today that the
                        question of the supply lines was still under consideration by the Soviet
                        authorities and I expressed the personal opinion that the Soviet Government
                        was reluctant at this time to facilitate the movement of supplies to China
                        through the Soviet Union for fear of provoking the Japanese.</p>

                    <p>527. During a conversation with Political Vice Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs<note n="3" xml:id="d486fn3">Foo Ping-sheung.</note> on Wednesday
                        I learned that China has been endeavoring for some time to arrange for
                        movement of oil and supplies through Iran and Soviet Russia for transport
                        thence by the northwest route into China, that the Russians have been
                        procrastinating in the matter, that China sought British assistance, that
                        Britain has suggested to China that as Russia is in need of tin it would be
                        desirable that China offer Russia tin which China cannot now ship to the
                        United States, and that the British mission in Washington and Chinese
                        Embassy are taking up this matter with our Government to obtain release of
                        tin earmarked for the United States. Vice Minister hoped that this might
                        lead to Russians consenting to transport Chinese supplies over Turk-Sib
                        Railway but has no assurance to that effect. He says that for the first few
                        months China could move about 4,000 tons a month by northwest route and
                        later increase tonnage to 8000. He expressed hope that American Government

                        the concern of the American Government in the matter.</p>

                    <p>627. Department’s 424, May 23, 6 p.m. The overland route from China to the
                        USSR begins at Lanchow, Kansu, and ends at Alma Ata in Russian Turkestan.
                        The distance is about 3000 kilometers (distance from Lanchow to Chungking is
                        1734 kilometers). Main termini moving westward are Suchow, Hsinghsinghsia
                        (on Sinkiang border), Hami, Tihua (Urumchi), and Hoerhkuossu (on Sinkiang
                        border). Chinese report road in good condition. There are airfields at
                        places named. In the past Hsinghsinghsia has been junction for Russian and
                        Chinese transport but Chinese now express preference for Hami as
                        junction.</p>
                    <p>Since outbreak of Russo-German hostilities, amount of cargo moving over route
                        has been negligible. Based on initial monthly transport of 5000 metric tons,
                        Chinese Communications Ministry has worked out plans as follows:</p>
                    <p>One thousand trucks operating between Hami and Lanchow would carry something
                        over 3000 tons monthly. There are now some 500 serviceable trucks at
                        Lanchow; 500 [not?] in use at Kunming should be transferred to Lanchow.
                        Carts and camels can transport somewhat less than average 2000 tons monthly
                        from Hami to Lanchow. Alma Ata to Hami haul would require about 1500 trucks
                        for 5000 tons monthly. Chinese assume that Russia would provide trucks for
                        this haul. (Actually there are believed to be sufficient trucks—estimated
                        between one and 2000 not now in use in Kunming area that could be used in
                        Sinkiang.)</p>
                    <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0606"/>
                    <p>Gasoline for trucks would be laid down by transport planes operating out of
                        Alma Ata at Hami and other points en route. There is no air service now.
                        Estimate 20 American planes DC–3 type could transport monthly requirement
                        1500 tons gasoline for trucks. Chinese request that Russians furnish China
                        gasoline against delivery to Russia of gasoline at some other designated
                        place is reported to have been refused. Chinese envisage transport of
                        materials and supplies to Alma Ata from Persian Gulf to Caspian Sea and
                        thence over Turk-Sib railway.</p>
                    <p>Transport of strategic materials from China over same route would require
                        long haul in as much as most of the materials—tungsten, tin, silk,
                        bristles—originate in south.</p>
                    <p>The Alma Ata-Lanchow trucking route appears to be most practical. Possible
                        alternate air transport routes Lanchow-Ninghsia-Urga-Irkutsk (1500
                        kilometers) and Kabul through South Sinkiang to Suchow, Kansu.</p>
                    <p>Two major factors are involved, (1) Russian assent to transit of war
                        materials for China and agreement to transport materials to Alma Ata and (2)
                        supply of gasoline for truck operation between Alma Ata and Lanchow. Other
                        problems such as supply of trucks, spare parts, and tires, et cetera can
                        probably be solved once factors above are resolved.</p>
                    <p>Embassy will report further on situation as any additional information
                        becomes available.</p>

                        partial data have been obtained through conversations between the Chinese
                        Military Attaché, Major General Kuo, and Colonel Michela:<note n="8"
                            xml:id="d492fn8">Millitary Attaché in the Soviet Union.</note>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>By way of preliminary General Kuo stated that estimated shipments
                                over the Burma Road into China had run to approximately 17,000 tons
                                a month. He expressed the opinion that if quantities of materials
                                shipped in by other routes now that the Burma Road is closed should
                                not fall below 10,000 tons a month this would be adequate to replace

                                Road to a sufficient degree to “keep China going”. General Kuo
                                discussed the following overland routes (reference is made in this
                                connection to the Department’s 224, May 15, 2 p.m.); Sergiopol
                                (Ayaguz)–Usu–Hami; Alma Ata–Kuldja–Hami; Osh–Kashgar–Ansi; and
                                Osh–Kashgar–Yarkand–Khotan–Ansi. General Kuo stated that each of
                                these roads has a capacity of 300 3-ton trucks daily in either
                                direction and that the last two (more southerly) routes were the
                                best as food and water were more readily available. So far as China
                                is concerned, gasoline depots could be set up without special
                                difficulty on all the roads. From Hami to Lanchow, he added, it is a
                                2 weeks’ trip one way.</p>
                            <p>General Kuo also referred to the rail route from Karachi to
                                Rawalpindi, thence to Srinagar, from which point there is a pack
                                trail to Aze into the road between Yarkand and Khotan. Pack animals
                                in quantity are available here, he said, and such materials as
                                ammunition could be carried into China over this route.</p>
                            <p>The General referred further to the Karachi–Zahidan–Ashkhabad route
                                and also the Karachi–Peshawar (rail)–Kabul–Termez (road)–Bukhara
                                (rail) route, connecting at Bukhara with the Ashkhabad–Osh
                                Railway.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>From the foregoing it appears that there are plenty of routes available for
                        the shipment of upwards of 10,000 tons a month of essential materials into
                        China and that the real crux of the situation is the attitude of the Soviet
                        Government with respect to the utilization of its transport facilities for
                        this purpose. Three ships a month putting in at Karachi, Basra and/or
                        Archangel with supplies for China would amply meet the requirement set forth
                        and it is believed that the rail and road transport means could be made
                        available.</p>
                    <p>As regards the air route Alma Ata–Chungking, reference is made to Military
                        Attaché’s report to War Department number 1981, November 10, 1941.<note

                        known of the Irkutsk–Hami air route but it is the opinion of Michela that
                        this would be practicable in summer. The northern river routes mentioned in
                        Department’s telegram under reference have not been investigated for the
                        reasons stated above but in view of the short time which these are open it
                        is feared that they may remain little more than academic for the
                        present.</p>

                        Soviet Government could not discuss the question of the exchange of Soviet
                        gasoline for Chinese tin until the Chinese Government had settled certain
                        tin and wolfram commitments made under former Soviet-Chinese trade
                        agreements which had not been fulfilled. To this the Chinese Ambassador
                        replied that since these products could no longer be exported to the Soviet
                        Union by sea but had to come by truck, and in view of the shortages in China
                        of gasoline and spare truck parts, it would be impossible for China to
                        fulfill the commitments in question until it had received sufficient
                        quantities of gasoline and spare parts.</p>
                    <p>The Counselor stated that although no progress has been made in the
                        discussions relative to transit shipments to China the Soviet Government
                        continues ostensibly to desire to keep the question open. He is of the
                        opinion that the refusal of the Soviet Government so far to grant transit
                        rights is based on political and not technical considerations and believes
                        that the Soviet position is attributed not only to a reluctance to provoke
                        Japan but also to a policy, which the Soviet authorities consider
                        politically unwise to alter at this time, of not permitting military
                        supplies to pass in transit through the Soviet Union. This policy was set
                        forth in an order of the Commissariat <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599"
                            facs="0609"/>for Foreign Trade, dated March 18, 1941, prohibiting the
                        transit shipment of arms, munitions, military supplies, et cetera through
                        the Soviet Union, and was reported to the Department at that time.</p>
                    <p>As I intend to continue to impress upon the Soviet authorities the interests
                        of my Government in the question of the movement of supplies to China, I
                        would appreciate receiving any recent information on this matter, and
                        especially whether it came under discussion during Molotov’s visit.</p>

                    <p>166. Your 544, June 18, noon. We took advantage of Molotov’s presence here in
                        order to impress upon him on several occasions how important it is to the
                        common cause that military supplies be allowed to pass in transit through
                        the Soviet Union to China. Although Molotov listened with interest to the
                        remarks made to him on this subject he did not commit the Soviet Government
                        in any way. He promised, however, to discuss the matter with Stalin.<note

                    <p>787. My 627, May 29, 9 a.m. According to Transport Control Board, present
                        total capacity of northwest route to Russia using both motor and animal
                        transport is about 2800 tons per month. Bureau has 600 vehicles at present
                        but only 300 can be operated at one time. If 400 trucks are transferred from
                        Burma road and an additional 400 placed in operation as well the total
                        capacity of the road may be increased to 4400 tons per month. Last figure
                        also allows for cargo to be carried by pack animals and carts but it does
                        not include fuel consumed by trucks en route.</p>

                    <p>232. Department’s 217, May 9, 8 [<hi rend="italic">7</hi>] p.m. In my
                        conversation with Stalin yesterday, I also took up the question of transit
                        supplies to China through Soviet territory. I stated that my Government felt
                        that it was highly important that China as one of the United Nations should
                        continue in the war but that unless it was able to obtain military supplies
                        from the outside, it would be unable to continue the struggle. I stated that
                        the United States was now flying supplies and munitions into China, that
                        these apparently were not adequate, that Chinese Government desired to
                        obtain supplies either through Iran or Karachi and that eventually these
                        supplies would have to be carried on railroads through Soviet territory.</p>
                    <p>In answer to Stalin’s question as to exactly what supplies were involved, I
                        stated that I was unable to give him any details, that these would have to
                        be given by the Chinese. I added that my Government was particularly
                        concerned in having him give sympathetic consideration to the Chinese
                        requests for transit facilities and I was given the impression that he would
                        do so.</p>

                        have now approached us in regard to two other routes.</p>

                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>These routes are both air routes whose terminal point in China would
                            be in the neighborhood of Kashgar. The first would go via Gilgit to a
                            suitable point in India near Peshawar, and the second via Kabul to India
                            or Iran. His Majesty’s Government were asked to grant facilities to
                            survey the first route and to approach the Afghan Government in regard
                            to the second.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Our Ambassador at Chungking is informing the Chinese Government that
                            the first route is impracticable for aircraft other than stratosphere
                            types, but that the Government of India are prepared to give all
                            necessary facilities towards the establishment of a route from Northern
                            India (Risalpur) to Sinkiang as soon as the requisite <pb n="601"
                                xml:id="pg_601" facs="0611"/>planes are available. A survey flight
                            by an American plane which happened to be available in India at the time
                            was arranged for June 23rd and 24th, but we have not yet heard whether
                            this actually took place.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>As regards the Afghan route, our Ambassador is informing the Chinese
                            Government that as a flight from Sinkiang to Kabul would have to cross
                            the Hindu Kush, this route offers no operational advantages over the
                            direct route between India and Sinkiang, in regard to which facilities
                            have already been offered. The Afghan National Assembly in November 1941
                            passed a resolution that “the use of land or air routes in or through
                            Afghanistan must in no circumstances be conceded”, and the Afghan
                            Government therefore seems certain to refuse the request for facilities.
                            For these two reasons the Chinese Government are being informed that His
                            Majesty’s Government do not propose to pursue further the question of
                            the Afghan route.</item>

                        <item>It was thought that the above information might be of interest to the
                            United States authorities.</item>

                    <p>3972. In discussing the Far Eastern situation with Ashley Clarke<note n="17"
                            xml:id="d500fn17">Head of the Far Eastern Department, British Foreign
                            Office.</note> he told us of a telegram received recently from the
                        British Ambassador <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0612"/>at Chungking.
                        The latter reported that the flock of current “peace rumors” now circulating
                        in China, which he said is customary in periods of Japanese military
                        success, should not be taken seriously. He said that there were no
                        indications of any early Chinese collapse or of any further deterioration of
                        Chinese morale; on the contrary the improvement in the food situation as
                        this summer’s abundant crops came on the market has been helpful.</p>
                    <p>Ashley Clarke expressed the view that other than the obvious attempt to
                        prevent possible Allied use of bases in China for operations against Japan
                        and the important occupation of the entire Hankow-Canton railway there were
                        no clear indications of intended future Japanese moves. Both for military
                        reasons and internal Japanese political reasons, a termination of the “China
                        incident” is most important but there are no signs that any such development
                        is likely in the visible future or exactly what plans Japan may have to
                        bring it about. There are likewise no signs, he said, of important
                        defections on the Chinese side though the loyalty of a number of Chiang
                        Kai-shek’s supporters—he mentioned the Governor of Hunan specifically—may
                        bear watching.</p>
                    <p>In spite of some increase in Japanese forces in Manchukuo there are no
                        important signs, he said, that any move against Siberia is imminent. Like
                        most British officials he is inclined to think that the Japanese will
                        carefully observe German progress in her Russian campaign before grasping
                        any longed for opportunity to remove the threat of Vladivostok from her back
                        door.</p>
                    <p>We inquired whether any progress had been made in eliciting Russian
                        cooperation in the matter of supplies and supply routes to China. He replied
                        that the question was one on which the Foreign Office is doing all that it
                        can but so far without success. In the light of other recent developments,
                        he said, the Foreign Office is not in a strong position to insist with the
                        Russians without exposing itself to embarrassing rejoinders. There is no
                        doubt, he went on, that from the long-term point of view Russia realizes its
                        vital interest in the maintenance of Chinese resistance to Japan. From the
                        short-term point of view, however, the lack of greater Russian cooperation,
                        he said, is probably due to several factors. First and most important of
                        these is Moscow’s desire to avoid any move which may irritate Japan or tend
                        to tip the scales of Japanese policy toward an attack on Russia’s Far
                        Eastern rear. A second factor presumably is that the urgent and immediate
                        attention of all those in authority is concentrated on the growing German
                        threat to Russia’s armies and the existence of the régime. A third reason,
                        he said, is a probable Russian desire to keep every available inch of
                        transport space for supplies she so badly needs herself; and the same holds
                        true with respect <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0613"/>to Russian
                        assistance in fuel or motor transport diverted to China. Besides, he
                        concluded, the Russians being “very practical people” probably feel that the
                        small amount of arms and war material which could be made available to the
                        Chinese under the circumstances and over the proposed routes would weigh
                        little in the balance of Chinese resistance or collapse—an argument which of
                        course takes no account of stiffening of morale which might result from even
                        a trickle. Ashley Clarke indicated that the Foreign Office is, however,
                        quite conscious of the importance of China to the United Nations victory
                        prospects and will lose no opportunity to help bolster the
                        Generalissimo.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, he said, in spite of Tibetan pride in their country’s
                        autonomy and their rather anti-Chinese sentiments, arrangements are now
                        being concluded for a pack-mule route from India to China over the Tibetan
                        mountains which should provide small quantities of gasoline, medical
                        supplies and other badly needed materials; it is hoped to get the first
                        mule-train started soon. (The Tibetans have declined to permit the passage
                        over their territory of ammunition, machine guns or other arms.)</p>

                        has given Embassy following information in confidence: Although a formal
                        agreement for exchange of Russian for Chinese products by Sinkiang has not
                        yet actually been concluded, such exchanges <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604"
                            facs="0614"/>will take place. Exchange will be on simple tonnage
                        basis—about 2,000 tons of Russian gasoline for 2,000 tons Chinese strategic
                        materials during remainder this year—exchange to take place at Hsinghsinghai
                        on Kansu border or Hami, probably former.</p>
                    <p>With regard to transit of Lend-Lease material through Russian Turkestan to
                        China via Sinkiang, Russians are being evasive.</p>
                    <p>With regard to air transport recent CNAC<note n="19" xml:id="d502fn19">China

                    <p>In order to facilitate the supply of war material to China from India His
                        Majesty’s Government have, as the United States Government are aware, been
                        considering among other routes one which would go from Karachi via Eastern
                        Persia and Meshed to Ashkhabad, and thence via the Turksib railroad to Alma
                        Ata and across Northwest China to Lanchow and Chungking.</p>
                    <p>2. His Majesty’s Ambassador to Moscow has for some time been endeavoring to
                        obtain the consent of the Soviet Government to the use of the Soviet section
                        of this route, in support of a <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi> previously
                        made to the Soviet authorities by the Chinese Ambassador. In view of the
                        close association of the United States Government with China’s war effort,
                        it is hoped that the State Department might also consider the possibility of
                        instructing the United States Ambassador in Moscow to make parallel
                        representations to the Soviet Government.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Durbrow</hi>: The Chinese are very anxious to
                        get our cooperation in the development of a supply route by trucks from
                        Karachi <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0615"/>to Meshed. This will
                        require the Russians to undertake a short truck haul to the Turk-Sib Railway
                        and then by rail to Sergiopol.</p>
                    <p>What they are trying to do is to get the Russians to handle about 100 tons a
                        day.</p>
                    <p>The British Ambassador in Moscow has apparently been asked by the British
                        Government to approach the Russian Government to support the request being
                        made by the Chinese Ambassador in Moscow. The Chinese are anxious to have
                        similar instructions sent to Ambassador Standley.</p>
                    <p>While I think the Russians may hesitate to grant this request, there is no
                        question but what it would be a real help to China and I can see nothing to
                        be lost by our giving them a little help.</p>
                    <p>There, of course, may be other reasons which would make it unwise to send
                        these instructions to Ambassador Standley.</p>

                        yesterday the Chinese Ambassador informed me that the Soviet authorities had

                        Union in transit to China. He said that they had indicated to him that a
                        conference to discuss the details of such an arrangement would be necessary
                        and that he had requested his government to designate the Chinese delegates

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Hopkins</hi>: I refer to your letter of
                        September 22 addressed to Mr. Elbridge Durbrow of this Department relative
                        to the desire of the Chinese Government to develop a supply route from
                        Karachi through Iran and the Soviet Union to China.</p>
                    <p>In this connection you may recall that the Department in a telegram dated May
                        9 requested Admiral Standley to urge the Soviet authorities to give
                        sympathetic consideration to the Chinese proposal to send supplies to China
                        through the Soviet Union. The Admiral in a telegram dated July 3 informed
                        the Department that he had discussed this question with Stalin and had
                        received the impression that sympathetic consideration would be given to the
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>On September 21 the British Embassy left an <hi rend="italic"
                            >aide-mémoire</hi> at the Department indicating that the British
                        Government had instructed its Ambassador in Moscow to support the Chinese
                            <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi> to the Soviet authorities for permission
                        to transit war materials over the Soviet railroad line from Ashkhabad to
                        Alma Ata and suggested that the Department might desire to instruct Admiral
                        Standley to use his good offices in support of this Chinese request. On
                        September 22 a Secretary of the British Embassy telephoned to say that it
                        would no <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0617"/>longer be necessary to
                        telegraph Admiral Standley since the British Foreign Office had just
                        informed the Embassy that the Soviet Government had agreed to the
                        proposal.</p>

                            <item>The development of the road route from Nok-Kundi to Meshed via
                                Zahidan will be completed up to a capacity of 10,000 tons a month
                                provided the Soviet Government agrees that 60% of the supplies
                                delivered at Meshed over this route will be destined for China and

                                delivered at Meshed will be consigned to the Soviet Union. As a

                        to source.</p>
                    <p>Replying to questions seriatim: 1. Condition of northwest highway is
                        satisfactory. 2. There are only about 300 serviceable trucks in Sinkiang
                        available to Chinese. Hope entertained that Russians might be persuaded to
                        provide trucking facilities. 3. Chinese consider it impracticable to divert
                        gas producers or other trucks from China proper to Sinkiang. 4. Very limited
                        amount of Russian materials (gasoline) now being delivered to Kansu border
                        by Russian trucks and amounts of Chinese cargo (strategic materials) moving
                        toward Russia even more limited. 5. See Embassy’s despatches Nos. 443 and

                            printed.</note> giving some details of Sinkiang oil output forwarded by
                        pouch last week.</p>
                    <p>Responsible Chinese consider that maximum amount of materials that can be
                        moved across Sinkiang to destinations in China is 2,000 tons monthly
                        exclusive of gasoline for transport which they estimate at 1,000 tons
                        monthly. Russians have agreed in principle to transit of materials over
                        Turkish-Siberian railway and will undertake truck transportation across
                        Sinkiang if Chinese will provide materials at Hsinghsinghsia on
                        Sinkiang-Kansu border for return trip. Chinese will find it extremely
                        difficult to provide 2,000 tons monthly having been unable so far to promise
                        more than 500 tons.</p>
                    <p>Transportation across Sinkiang is the bottleneck. Movement of materials in
                        excess of 2,000 tons monthly to Alma Ata in expectation that it would be
                        moved into China would be impracticable and prove wasteful resulting simply
                        in concentration at Alma Ata. With reference to mention of Sergiopol Chinese
                        consider Alma Ata as logical Turkish-Siberian terminus for shipments to
                        China.</p>
                    <p>Chinese express hope that Lend-Lease trucks in India on consignment to China
                        be assembled and form first shipment via Iran and Turkish-Siberian to China
                        loaded with materials if possible. They anticipate using these trucks in
                        northwest China proper rather than in Sinkiang, however.</p>
                    <p>Until Chinese have solved problem of transport across Sinkiang it would be
                        premature to commence movement of any volume of Lend-Lease materials to Alma
                        Ata.</p>

                                assist China in the matter of transit trade and left to Mikoyan the
                                discussion of details. Mikoyan promised to refer the draft to his
                                government and said that his representative in Kuibyshev would give
                                the Soviet answer to the Chinese Chargé d’Affaires. Mikoyan
                                expressed the opinion that the success of the transit scheme depends
                                upon the willingness and ability of the British to repair and
                                improve the railway between Quetta and Zahidan and to provide trucks
                                for the highways between Quetta and Ashkhabad and between Alma Ata
                                and Hami. He added that the Soviet Union would not agree to the
                                shipment of transit goods for China through Iranian ports [since
                                route through?] Iran was already congested with Soviet war
                                materials. The British had promised to deliver to the Soviet Union
                                80,000 tons monthly through this route but were bringing only 35,000
                                tons monthly.</item>

                                depended to a large extent on the ability of the Americans to
                                deliver the required amount of trucks in the near future at Karachi.
                                He understood that the matter had already been taken up in
                                Washington; that trucks were available; but that there might be some
                                difficulties with regard to vessels for transport. He also suggested

                                latter was to furnish gasoline and oil between Alma Ata and

                                    that 2,000 tons of petroleum products will be required to move
                                    15,000 tons of supplies over stretch A. If Russians will not
                                    furnish fuel, a tremendous amount of carrying capacity will be
                                    consumed in transporting it from Iranian gulf ports to Zahidan

                            that if the British attempt to send any appreciable amount of supplies
                            over the eastern route to China just as soon as the Railroad is repaired
                            considerable confusion may result unless the Soviet Government shows a
                            livelier interest in Chinese transit trade than it has in the past. The
                            Russians have thus far not answered questions put to them in writing on
                            October 13 by the British regarding transport over stretch B and
                            assistance which might be required over stretch C. They may desire that
                            for period following the reopening of the railroad the eastern route
                            will be used exclusively for their benefit while they are negotiating
                            with the Chinese and the British with regard to various questions which
                            must be settled before goods destined for China can begin to

                            through Ashkhabad and Alma Ata and said that it would be appreciated if
                            the Soviet Government would keep the Embassy informed regarding such
                            progress as might be made towards the opening of this traffic. Lozovski
                            replied that certain conversations had taken place between the Soviet
                            Government and the British and Chinese Governments and were still going

                            reduction of oil to 600 tons monthly but request it not be included in
                            2000 tons. There the matter appears to rest.</item>

                            Chinese, and Russians are apparently anxious that this stipulation be
                            met. National Resources Commission will endeavor to deliver 500 tons

                            will be doing well if they deliver 1000 tons.</item>

                    <p>1255. 1. Mr. Currie on behalf of the Lend-Lease Administration has informed
                        the Department that a member of the British supply organization in
                        Washington has stated that the British and Soviet Governments have concluded
                        an agreement by which (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the Soviet Government is to
                        deliver to the Chinese Government monthly 2,000 tons of American Lend-Lease
                        supplies to be moved into China by trucks over the northwest route and (<hi
                            rend="italic">b</hi>) the Soviet Government is in addition to supply
                        monthly to the Chinese Government 600 tons of petroleum products for
                        transportation by truck of the foregoing 2,000 tons over the northwest
                        route. The British official referred to also stated that successful
                        operation of the agreement was dependent upon the United States supplying a
                        large number of trucks to China under Lend-Lease. Representatives of China
                        Defense Supplies have informally raised the question of shipping to Karachi
                        a large number of trucks in order to carry out the foregoing
                        arrangement.</p>
                    <p>2. The Department assumes that the foregoing relates to the proposed route
                        for sending Lend-Lease supplies to China by way of Karachi, Baluchistan,
                        Iran, the Soviet Union and Sinkiang by succeeding rail and truck routes. The
                        Department has understood that the proposed agreement between the British
                        and Russians relating to this route included terms of the kind set forth in
                        the preceding paragraph and a further provision that of the supplies
                        entering the Soviet Union from Iran over this route sixty percent would be
                        destined for China and forty percent would be retained by the Soviet Union.
                        However, the Department’s information has heretofore indicated that the
                        agreement was contingent upon Chinese ability to supply the Russians with
                        2,000 tons a month of supplies produced in China and that the Chinese have
                        been and are likely to continue to be unable to supply such an amount.</p>
                    <p>3. The Department requests that, unless you perceive objection, you inquire
                        of the Chinese Government whether the agreement mentioned in paragraph (1)
                        has been communicated to the Chinese Government and whether the Chinese have
                        reached agreement with the Russians on the matter of providing Chinese
                        supplies to Russia. If any such agreement has been reached between the
                        Chinese and the Russians the Department would like to be informed as to
                        pertinent details.</p>
                    <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0630"/>
                    <p>4. We have instructed our Embassy at Kuibyshev to ascertain officially from
                        the Soviet Government whether or not the agreement mentioned in paragraph
                        (1) has been concluded and, if it has, to ask for the terms of the
                        agreement. We are also instructing the Embassy to make inquiry as to whether
                        agreement has been reached between the Chinese and the Russians with respect
                        to the provision of Chinese supplies to Russia. We are making similar
                        inquiries of the British Embassy here.</p>

                        <item>The chief of the American section of the Foreign Office informed me
                            that matters relating to Chinese transit traffic across the Soviet Union
                            should be discussed with Lozovski, Assistant Commissar for Foreign
                            Affairs, who is handling them. Lozovski told me yesterday that there was
                            no agreement with Great Britain on the subject; there had not even been
                            negotiations with the British since the subject was clearly one for
                            direct negotiations between the Soviet and Chinese Governments; that the
                            Soviet Government had agreed in principle to the shipment of merchandise
                            to China across the Soviet Union from Iran; that technical discussions
                            with the Chinese in this regard thus far had resulted in no agreement;
                            that arrangements for equipment such as trucks for use in this transit
                            traffic must be arranged by China rather than by the Soviet Union. I
                            said that it was my understanding that since the British Government
                            would be responsible for delivering the merchandise at the Soviet
                            frontier the British were interested parties and had been discussing
                            with the Soviet Government and that the conversations had touched upon

                            need. Lozovski again denied that such discussions had taken place,
                            insisting that the Chinese rather than the Soviets should negotiate
                            matters relating to British and American equipment necessary for the
                            carrying on of the traffic. Lozovski had been informed in advance of the
                            nature of the questions which I intended to ask. I am therefore at a
                            loss to understand his apparent lack of knowledge of the negotiations
                            which have certainly been taking place between the British and the
                            Russians.</item>

                                <item>They are confident that no agreement or understanding had as
                                    yet been reached between the British and Soviet Governments with
                                    regard to Chinese transit traffic. Conversations on the subject
                                    had been taking place between the Ambassador and Molotov and
                                    between the British Embassy in Kuibyshev and Mishustin, Chief of
                                    the Trade Treaty Department of the Commissariat for Foreign
                                    Trade. They doubted that the British Government was planning to
                                    enter into any formal agreement with the Russians with regard to
                                    this subject. They thought that the British aim was merely to
                                    come to an informal understanding with the Russians which would
                                    permit foods to go forward from Iran to China. On November 8
                                    Misnustin ad written a letter to Gifford stating that on the
                                    10th of September, the Soviet Government had informed the
                                    Chinese Government that it had decided in favor of the
                                    transportation of goods from India to China via Iran and the
                                    Soviet Union. Attached to this letter was a list of equipment
                                    which would be necessary in order to transport 2000 tons of
                                    Chinese goods monthly from Sary-Ozek (the railhead near Alma
                                    Ata) to Hsinghsinghsia (a point about 200 kilometers east of
                                    Hami). The letter in referring to the list requested that “the
                                    respective British competent authorities should as urgently as
                                    possible consider the abovementioned specifications and state
                                    the date of delivery”. Among the equipment listed by the
                                    Russians in the enclosure to the letter (a copy of which has
                                    been given to us by the British Embassy) are 1120 Dodge auto
                                    trucks T–203–1; two mobile motor transport repair stations types
                                    A and B; one mobile battery charging station; one special mobile

                                <item>It was probably this letter which had prompted Currie to
                                    approach Lend-Lease. The British can do little [more in?]
                                    discussions here until the question of trucks has been decided.
                                    Early in December they suggested to the Russians that in view of
                                    congested traffic conditions in the Near East it might be
                                    advisable to ship trucks for use east of Alma Ata from the
                                    United States via Vladivostok. The Russians replied that they
                                    did not have ships for this purpose. The British therefore were
                                    planning to inquire whether the United States Government could
                                    not transfer bottoms to the Russians for the transportation of
                                    trucks to the Soviet Far East.</item>

                                    would not be able to transport more than 2000 tons monthly to
                                    China over the Russian railroad, the British were inclined to
                                    agree to allow the Russians temporarily more than 40 per cent
                                    and up to 50 per cent of merchandise shipped through Meshed
                                    provided the Chinese received their 2000 tons monthly.</item>

                                        <item>The Chinese Embassy last week, upon instructions from
                                            its Government, had replied that the Chinese Government
                                            preferred Hami as the delivery point since
                                            Hsinghsinghsia was a small village without the
                                            facilities, including water, which a transshipment point
                                            should have. The Chinese reply did not touch on the
                                            differences regarding the volume of petroleum products.
                                            It contained, however, a suggestion that in order to
                                            test the route an effort be made to send an initial
                                            shipment of 500 tons at once without awaiting the
                                            arrival of trucks or other equipment. (The Chargé has
                                            requested that information regarding this suggestion be
                                            kept especially secret.) The Russians, without formally
                                            replying to this suggestion, pointed out that they had
                                            no means of transporting any supplies beyond Alma

                        <item>It is my feeling that if we seriously desire goods to proceed in the
                            near future to China via the Near East and the Soviet Union, we should
                            begin at once, without waiting for the conclusion of any definite
                            understandings or formal agreements, to send trucks together with
                            equipment for assembling and repairing them and spare parts to points in
                            the Near East where they could most easily be delivered to Zahidan for
                            use in Iran and to Ashkhabad for use east of Alma Ata. In any event it
                            is almost certain that many misunderstandings and differences will arise
                            in connection with the shipment of goods across this route since
                            obviously the Russians in view of their own difficult military situation
                            are not anxious to make the sacrifices in shipping space, oil products,
                            and personnel which they will be called upon to contribute. My
                            impression, based on talks with Chinese officials <pb n="623"
                                xml:id="pg_623" facs="0633"/>here, is that there is more doubt than
                            they will admit of the ability of China to make prompt deliveries of any
                            appreciable quantity of raw materials to the Russians. I nevertheless
                            feel that it would make an unfortunate impression on both the Russians
                            and the Chinese if the project should be allowed to drop because of lack
                            of American trucks.</item>

                        Ilia Tolstoy and Lieutenant Brooke Dolan, are being sent on a mission via
                        India and Tibet to General Stilwell<note n="1" xml:id="d522fn1">Lt. Gen.

                    <p>This office, therefore, requests that the State Department should instruct
                        the head of its diplomatic mission in New Delhi, India, to expedite the
                        obtaining of a permit from the British authorities in India for Ilia Tolstoy
                        and Brooke Dolan to enter Tibet, by way of India, and to be allowed freedom
                        of travel in Tibet in so far as the British are able to grant it without the
                        necessity of returning to India.</p>
                    <p>Our military authorities in India will verify and confirm this mission to the
                        State Department representatives in New Delhi in order that negotiations
                        with the British authorities, civil and military, may be facilitated.</p>
                    <p>This mission is of strategic importance and we hope will prove of long term
                        value in the furtherance of the war effort in the Asiatic theatre.</p>
                    <p>We are keeping this project <hi rend="italic">most secret</hi> and we feel it
                        desirable to avoid any mention of the military status of these two men in
                        any negotiations. When they personally contact American State Department and
                        Military authorities in India, the matter can be discussed and arranged in
                        fullest confidence with the British. Certain British authorities in India
                        are already informed as to the nature of their mission.</p>

                    <p>Colonel William J. Donovan, Director of the Office of Strategic Services, is
                        sending two members of his organization on a special and confidential
                        mission to China via India and Tibet. It is believed that the work of the
                        mission in Tibet would be greatly facilitated if you were to provide it with
                        a letter of introduction to the Dalai Lama of Tibet. A draft of such letter
                        is attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d523fn2">
                            <hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>, as signed.</note> The letter is addressed
                        to the Dalai Lama in his capacity of religious leader of Tibet, rather than
                        in his capacity of secular leader of Tibet, thus avoiding giving any
                        possible offense to the Chinese Government which includes Tibet in the
                        territory of the Republic of China. It is understood that Colonel Donovan is
                        getting in touch with your office with regard to the form of delivery of the
                        letter, if approved by you.</p>

                        and widely famed city of Lhasa. There are in the United States of America
                        many persons, among them myself, who, long and greatly interested in your

                        twenty-seven other countries, are now engaged in a war which has been thrust
                        upon the world by nations bent on conquest who are intent upon destroying
                        freedom of thought, of religion, and of action everywhere. The United
                        Nations are fighting today in defense of and for preservation of freedom,
                        confident that we shall be victorious because our cause is just, our
                        capacity is adequate, and our determination is unshakable.</p>

                    <p>592. The British Embassy has informally supplied the Department with a copy
                        of a telegram from the British Foreign Office<note n="3" xml:id="d525fn3"
                            >Not printed.</note> in which it is stated that, in reply to further
                        representations by the Government of India, Tibet has definitely refused
                        permit for passage of supplies to China on the ground of desire to stay out
                        of the war; that if necessary the British Government is prepared, in
                        association with the Chinese, to speak plainly to Tibet and to threaten
                        economic sanctions in order to change the Tibetan attitude, but feels that
                        prior thereto the Chinese Government should do its part to facilitate
                        Tibetan acquiescence, as Tibetan reluctance is believed to be largely due to
                        fear of Chinese penetration; that the British Government asked Ambassador
                            Seymour<note n="4" xml:id="d525fn4">Sir Horace James Seymour, British
                            Ambassador in China.</note> to suggest to the Chinese Government that it
                        give definite and public undertaking of intention to respect Tibetan
                        autonomy and to refrain from interfering in Tibet’s internal administration;
                        that, if the Chinese would do this, Great Britain would be ready to
                        cooperate with them in exercising joint pressure; that it was pointed out
                        that the British Government was asking no more of the Chinese in relation to
                        Tibet than the Chinese had already strongly recommended to the British in
                        relation to India, namely, free and willing cooperation in the joint
                        struggle against aggression; and that subsequently Seymour reported that he
                        had approached the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs,<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d525fn5">Foo Ping-sheung.</note> who had seemed at first sight
                        to see nothing contrary to Chinese policy in the proposed declaration and
                        who said that he would consider the matter and communicate again. For your
                        information, it may be added that the telegram refers in two instances to
                        Tibetan “independence” and in another instance to Tibetan “autonomy”. It is
                        not clear whether these words are used interchangeably or not.</p>
                    <p>We should appreciate receiving such information as you may have or be in
                        position discreetly to obtain with regard to the difficulties of supply via
                        Tibet referred to by the British and such comments and suggestions as may
                        occur to you. We of course desire that a practical solution be found of any
                        existing difficulties. As you are aware, the Chinese Government has long
                        claimed suzerainty over Tibet, the Chinese constitution lists Tibet among
                        areas constituting the territory of the Republic of China, and this
                        Government has at no time raised question regarding either of these
                        claims.</p>

                    <p>835. Department’s 592, July 3, 10 p.m. Inquiry by Embassy discloses that the
                        Tibetan authorities have agreed to the passage through Tibet of non-military
                        supplies for China. The term “non-military” will not be strictly
                        interpreted. Technical details have not yet been worked out. Transit through
                        Tibet is practicable by pack animal trains making one trip a year but the
                        amount that can be transported (maximum estimates place it at 3000 tons
                        annually) renders the project of minor importance as a supply route to
                        China. The round trip requires 6 months and about half of the year travel is
                        impracticable.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese have abandoned whatever plans they may have had for constructing
                        a motor road and for stationing troops in Tibet, the former because the road
                        would have no early value to the war effort due to the time required for
                        construction and the latter because Tibetan opposition would certainly be
                        encountered.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese plan to station technicians along the route to facilitate
                        transportation. The Tibetan authorities are being assured that these
                        technicians will not engage in any political activities; that they will be
                        instructed to confine themselves to the matter of supervising transport. The
                        Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs states that this is as far as the Chinese
                        Government is prepared to go in response the British suggestion mentioned in
                        the reference telegram. The Vice Minister said there was no occasion for
                        giving assurances regarding “autonomy”; that Tibet was considered a part of
                        the Republic of China; but that China had no intention of altering the
                        situation whereby internal administration in Tibet is in fact
                        autonomous.</p>

                        questions relating to Tibet.</p>
                    <p>It would appear from Chungking’s reference telegram that the Tibetan
                        authorities have agreed to the transit of non-military supplies for China
                        through Tibet, and that a strict interpretation will not be made of the term
                        “non-military”. It is believed that this information <pb n="628"
                            xml:id="pg_628" facs="0638"/>should be brought informally and orally to

                    <p>It is further believed that we might orally and in strict confidence
                        communicate to Mr. Hayter the information contained in and the views of the
                        Chinese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed in the last paragraph of
                        the reference telegram. We might at the same time mention that suzerainty
                        over Tibet has long been claimed by the Chinese Government, and that Tibet
                        is listed in the Chinese constitution among areas constituting the territory
                        of the Republic of China, adding that this Government has at no time raised

                    <p>In my recent conversation with Dr. T. F. Tsiang, Director of the Political
                        Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan, the question of transportation of
                        materials for China via Tibet was briefly touched upon.</p>
                    <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0639"/>
                    <p>Dr. Tsiang told me in confidence that the matter had been discussed that
                        morning at the weekly meeting of the Executive Yuan. He said that there
                        seemed to be general agreement to eliminate from the transport project
                        political considerations and factors. With this idea in mind it had
                        apparently been decided to accede to the Tibetan request that no materials
                        of war (munitions et cetera) be shipped in transit through Tibet from India
                        to China. Dr. Tsiang said that, considering the annual capacity of the
                        route, which he placed at 1,000 tons, the amount of direct war materials
                        that could be brought in would be unimportant and that it would be just as
                        well to utilize this route to transport medical supplies, gasoline, and
                        other materials essential to the prosecution of the war. He explained that
                        his figure of 1,000 tons a year was lower than the original estimate of
                        3,000 tons but that investigation had revealed that the previous figure had
                        been much too high. (In a conversation with Mr. Richardson, an Englishman
                        attached to the Indian Agent-General in Chungking, who is familiar with
                        transport conditions in India, I was told that maximum annual capacity for
                        transit materials would probably not exceed 700 tons.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. Tsiang recommended that, in order to overcome Tibetan fears that the
                        transit of materials would be used as an excuse for Chinese political
                        penetration, a commercial company be organized to handle transport and that
                        Tibetans and Indians as well as Chinese participate in the company. He
                        indicated that his recommendation was favorably received by the Executive
                        Yuan. It was preferable, he thought, to the British proposal that a joint
                        Anglo-Chinese-Tibetan commission be organized to handle transport.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Tsiang was interested in telling me of remarks Dr. Kung<note n="8"
                            xml:id="d529fn8">H. H. Kung, Chinese Minister of Finance.</note> had
                        made at the Executive Yuan meeting in regard to Tibet. Tsiang said that, at
                        a recent committee meeting in regard to transit of supplies through Tibet,
                        he had made the remark, in regard to Tibetan political status, that it was
                        about time that Chinese relations with Tibet were put on a realistic footing
                        and that Tibet be recognized for what it was—a “self-governing dominion”. At
                        the Executive Yuan meeting, Dr. Kung had taken up the same theme. He had
                        gone back into the classic period of Chinese history and ended with
                        reference to the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen to support his recommendation
                        (identical with that of Dr. Tsiang) that Tibet be considered and treated in
                        the Chinese political system as a self-governing dominion.</p>

                    <p>Government of India have been informed by the Chinese Commissioner there that

                        arms, ammunition and explosives); that they have selected the Gyalam as the
                        supply route with Batang as delivery point; and that they appeared to think
                        that contract with Tibetan transport firm must be negotiated by special
                        representative of the Ministry of Communications.</p>

                        <item>The above, taken along with the Chinese attitude towards the suggested
                            formal declaration of Tibetan autonomy, which His Majesty’s Ambassador
                            at Chungking has been informed “would present numerous difficulties”,
                            and their proposal to station Ministry of Communications experts to
                            organise the service along the Tibetan section of the route, would seem
                            to indicate that the Chinese are more anxious to extend their influence
                            in Eastern Tibet than to obtain supplies which in any event they do not
                            estimate at more than a maximum of 3,000 tons a year. Nevertheless we
                            are pursuing organisation of the route and have decided not to press for
                            the declaration suggested. Our attitude of support for Tibetan autonomy
                            still stands and we propose to continue to consult the Tibetan
                            Government as and when necessary regarding detailed arrangements
                            necessary in respect of the Tibetan section. In particular the Chinese
                            proposal to appoint supervisors appears unnecessary, apart from the
                            political objections involved, and it has been suggested to the Chinese
                            Commissioner that any difficulties which might arise could be solved by
                            joint intervention by the British and Chinese representatives at
                            Lhassa.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The present position is that the Tibetan Government have now agreed
                                <hi rend="italic">during the current year only</hi> to the despatch
                            from India for China of non-military supplies, preferably via the
                            Changlam to Jye-kundo, avoiding Lhassa, and as they cannot undertake to
                            handle transport themselves they suggest that a contract should be made
                            with a Tibetan firm for this year only. As regards the appointment of
                            Chinese technicians or experts, no such request has, they state, been
                            received from the Chinese representative at Lhassa and if made will be
                            refused, since in the Tibetan Government’s view neither British nor
                            Chinese supervisors should travel up and down the supply route in
                            Tibetan territory.</item>

                        <p>[In a memorandum dated September 15, 1942, the Chief of the Division of
                            Far Eastern Affairs (Hamilton) made the following comment: “It will be
                            recalled that on July 21, 1942, Mr. Hayter of the British Embassy was
                            informed orally and in strict confidence by Mr. Smyth of FE that
                            suzerainty over Tibet has long been claimed by the Chinese Government,
                            that Tibet is listed in the Chinese constitution among areas
                            constituting the territory of the Republic of China, and that this
                            Government has at no time raised question concerning either of these
                            claims. (See endorsement on attached FE memorandum of July 18, 1942.) It
                            is accordingly believed that we need make no comment to the British
                            Embassy at the present time with regard to the attitude of the British
                            Foreign Office on the subject of Tibetan autonomy.” 893.24/1445a]</p>

                    <p>This Government in collaboration with the British is endeavoring to ascertain
                        the availability of raw materials for joint defense needs during 1942 and
                        subsequent years. Consequently, you are requested to use your best efforts
                        to obtain and report by telegraph at the earliest possible moment at least
                        preliminary answers to the questions hereunder enumerated. The Department
                        realizes this involves some repetition of effort but confirmation of figures
                        already furnished the Department is nevertheless requested. In your
                        discretion, you may approach the appropriate department of the Government to
                        which you are accredited and request official assistance in obtaining the
                        data wherever this might be of help. In addition, you are authorized and
                        instructed to make the fullest possible use of any representatives of the
                        Bureau of Mines, the Federal Loan Agency or the Maritime Commission who
                        might be available.</p>

                            This estimate should indicate the total production of the country,

                        requested to telegraph a preliminary reply within a week. It is realized
                        that the complexities of questions 3 and 4 will limit such reply to the

                    <p>9. Department’s circular telegram of December 27, 6 p.m.</p>
                    <p>1. During 1942 there will be available 8,000 tons of tungsten, 5,000 tons of
                        antimony, and 7,000 tons of tin for shipment to the United States. Total
                        production during 1942 will amount to 12,000 tons of tungsten, 7,000 tons of
                        antimony, and 11,000 tons of tin. Of this amount 4,000 tons of tungsten,
                        2,000 tons of antimony, and 4,000 tons of tin are committed to the Soviet
                        Union under the Sino-Soviet barter agreements. Domestic consumption is
                        negligible.</p>
                    <p>Regarding quality, the tungsten ore contains an average of no less than 60
                            [<hi rend="italic">65</hi>]% of WO3, no more than 1.5 of tin and no more
                        than 0.2% of arsenic. The antimony regulus is of two kinds, about 2,000 tons
                        can be made 99.6% pure with no more than 0.1% of arsenic and the remaining
                        qualities are largely of 99% with no more than 0.3% of arsenic and a small
                        part 98%. Of the tin available, about 25% to 30% are of 99.75% purity and
                        the others of 99%. No accurate estimates can be made at present as to the
                        quantities of minerals that can be moved to the port of exportation as it
                        involves the question of transportation facilities as well as the supply of
                        gasoline. <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0644"/>The Minister of Economic
                            Affairs<note n="2" xml:id="d532fn2">Wong Wen-hao.</note> took up the
                        question of transporting these minerals with the Generalissimo<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d532fn3">Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Chinese Executive
                            Yuan (Premier).</note> and was assured by General Chiang Kai-shek that
                        priority would be given to the transportation of minerals destined to the
                        United States for defense purposes. Politics is a most important factor in
                        transportation and without the full cooperation of the Generalissimo we will
                        have difficulty in obtaining the minerals due to the transportation
                        factor.</p>
                    <p>2. At present there are 1,000 tons of tungsten, tons of antimony 4,000 and
                        1,500 tons of tin on hand. These ores are at the place of production. There
                        is some tin in Rangoon waiting shipment and according to the Ministry of
                        Economic Affairs the American ship <hi rend="italic">Tulsa</hi> now at
                        Rangoon has refused to load ores due to the recent air raids on Rangoon.</p>
                    <p>3. The production of minerals can be increased by 5,000 tons during 1942 if
                        conditions are favorable. No estimate can be obtained regarding increases
                        during years subsequent to 1942 but it is doubtful if the increase would be
                        appreciable.</p>
                    <p>4. In order to transport the 20,000 tons of minerals available for shipment
                        to the United States in 1942 from the point of production to the port of
                        export the supply of about 2½ million gallons of gasoline is necessary.
                        There are sufficient trucks to transport all these minerals to the port of
                        exportation provided they are given priority. The Chinese are very
                        apprehensive about sending materials to Rangoon at present for storage. It
                        is proposed to send the minerals to Calcutta via Rangoon rather than have
                        them stored at the latter port. The Chinese Government is taking up this
                        matter with the British authorities and the Minister of Economic Affairs
                        requested that the American Government also approach the British Government
                        in this matter.</p>
                    <p>In the event that future conditions make it impossible to export minerals
                        through Rangoon, the Minister of Economic Affairs suggested that the United
                        States supply cargo airplanes to transport minerals between Kunming and
                        Calcutta.</p>

                        the opinion that this amount could be made available at Rangoon during 1942
                        for export to the United States.</p>
                    <p>In view of estimate of 12,000 tons as 1942 production in paragraph 1 of your
                        telegram under reference, it would be helpful to the Department if you would
                        indicate sources of your estimate and if you would comment upon K. C. Li’s
                        estimate.</p>
                    <p>Assuming that K. C. Li’s estimate is over-optimistic, it occurs to the
                        Department that if ways could be found for sending practical mining experts
                        to China current tungsten production might be increased to some such figure
                        as Li has estimated. In any event, in view of importance of tungsten to our
                        war effort it might be desirable to send such experts in an endeavor to
                        increase tungsten production whatever the actual production of tungsten
                        would otherwise be.</p>
                    <p>Please give us the benefit of your views as to whether such a plan would be
                        practicable and useful and in the event of affirmative reaction on your part
                        indicate desirable qualifications of experts and the number of such experts
                        who might best be sent, and how best to fit them into the general
                        picture.</p>
                    <p>It has seemed to us that the transportation question involves two principal
                        stages: (1) transportation from the point of production to Kunming and (2)
                        transportation from Kunming to Lashio. According to our best information
                        here transportation of as much as 20,000 tons of tungsten per annum from
                        Kunming to Lashio should not, under present conditions, require any change
                        in existing transportation practices. This is based on assumption that
                        sufficient empty space is currently available in outward bound trucks and
                        that gasoline needed for these trucks is already provided for. The
                        Department assumes therefore that your reference paragraph 4 to gasoline
                        needs has reference to the stage of transportation from point of production
                        to Kunming and understands from your statement as to trucks that there are
                        sufficient trucks for this stage of the transportation as well as for the
                        journey from Kunming to Lashio. We have understood, however, that
                        transportation from point of production to Kunming is in large part by
                        coolie back, and we wonder to what extent trucks and gasoline need be used
                        for that transportation.</p>
                    <p>It would be helpful to us if, in your furnishing of estimates of
                        transportation and gasoline needs, you would, as requested above for your
                        estimates of mineral production, inform us of the sources of the
                        estimates.</p>

                    <p>40. Department’s 14, January 10, 3 p.m.</p>
                    <p>1. The information contained in my No. 9, January 2, 3 [<hi rend="italic"
                            >2</hi>] p.m., was obtained direct from Wong Wen-hao, Minister of
                        Economic Affairs who is concurrently Chairman of the National Resources
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>2. Upon being informed of K. C. Li’s estimate regarding the production of
                        tungsten, Wong gave the following explanation: a new agreement has been made
                        within the past few days between the Government of China and the
                        Import-Export Bank whereby China agrees to supply 15,000 tons of tungsten to
                        the United States during 1942. This agreement was made by H. H. Kung<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d534fn4">Chinese Minister of Finance.</note> acting on
                        behalf of the Chinese Government in his capacity as Vice President of the
                        Executive Yuan. Following an exchange of telegrams between Kung and Li and
                        T. V. Soong,<note n="5" xml:id="d534fn5">Chinese Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs.</note> the National Resources Commission was instructed to
                        increase the production of tungsten and that a minimum of 15,000 tons will
                        be available for the United States this year and to endeavor to supply
                        20,000 tons for the United States. Consequently the National Resources
                        Commission has had to revise its entire [plan] for mineral production during
                        1942. Figures given by Li certainly are far over optimistic. They were
                        supplied to him by Kung and not by the National Resources Commission.</p>
                    <p>We doubt that tungsten production in 1942 will be on a scale to make
                        available 20,000 tons for shipment to the United States and 15,000 tons
                        seems a high figure.</p>
                    <p>3. Wong who is himself a mining engineer did not respond favorably to the
                        suggestion that American experts be sent to China in an endeavor to increase
                        production. He claims that mining methods are so primitive that American
                        engineers could do nothing to assist but added that such experts would be
                        received well if we care to send them. I agree that American experts could
                        do little to increase production but believe it might be advisable to send
                        out one or two such engineers for the purpose of estimating the amount of
                        tungsten that can actually be produced. I regret to say that I do not think
                        we can rely on any figures given by the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>4. Wong now claims to have been misinformed about [gasoline] and was under
                        the impression that an additional 2½ million <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637"
                            facs="0647"/>dollars [<hi rend="italic">gallons</hi>] were required but
                        has since been advised that sufficient [fuel] will be available. Tin is the
                        only mineral transported by coolie back and that for short distances
                        only.</p>

                    <p>49. Department’s 14, January 10, 3 p.m. The Department understands through K.
                        C. Li that word has been received from Dr. H. H. Kung to the effect that,
                        because of prior commitments of 1 or 2,000 tons to Great Britain and 4,000
                        tons to the Soviet Union, the maximum shipments of wolframite to this
                        country, including the <hi rend="italic">Tulsa</hi> shipment, will be 15,000
                        tons. Dr. Kung added, however, that the National Resources Commission had
                        been directed to exert every effort in production toward attaining a 1942
                        goal of 20,000 tons for the United States.</p>

                        in the production of metals in China since my telegram No. 40, January 15, 1
                        p.m.</p>
                    <p>Due to the military situation in Burma, no metals have been sent there this
                        year for export to the United States. If metals cannot be exported from
                        China, it is feared that production will decrease appreciably.</p>
                    <p>Minister of Economic Affairs again stressed the necessity for establishing a
                        cargo air service between China and India.</p>

                    <p>174. The Government is most anxious that every possible step be taken to
                        assure the movement out of China of various strategic materials urgently
                        needed in this country. The War Department has suggested that the problem be
                        submitted to General Stilwell,<note n="8" xml:id="d538fn8">Lt. Gen. Joseph
                            W. Stilwell, Commanding General, United States Army Forces in China,
                            Burma, and India.</note> who is charged with the movement of goods into
                        China.</p>
                    <p>You are accordingly instructed to confer with General Stilwell or an
                        appropriate member of his staff and to impress upon him the great importance
                        of transporting the strategic materials out of China and of coordinating
                        this movement with the movement of goods into China.</p>
                    <p>The materials in question, listed in the order of importance in so far as
                        their movement from China is concerned are tungsten, tin, silk, bristles,
                        antimony and tung oil.</p>
                    <p>The tungsten, tin and antimony production are covered by contracts between
                        Metals Reserve Company and National Resources Commission. If these materials
                        are to be moved by air transport, it is possible that some adjustment may
                        have to be made to cover the additional cost involved. However, in view of
                        the fact that these materials are urgently needed in the war effort and are
                        covered by contracts with <pb n="639" xml:id="pg_639" facs="0649"/>a
                        governmental agency, could it not be arranged with General Stilwell to
                        transport them in government owned planes without additional cost. If this
                        is not possible, please advise urgently, giving your views as to excess
                        costs and other matters standing in way of prompt shipment.</p>
                    <p>No direct contracts have been made by a governmental agency covering the
                        purchase of bristles and tung oil, but such contracts could be arranged if
                        it would expedite the transportation of larger amounts of these materials
                        than would otherwise be moved to the United States. Please telegraph the
                        Department if you believe such contracts advisable. In such event, please
                        advise whether matter should be discussed with Chinese representatives here
                        or by the Embassy in Chungking. In the latter event please state quantities
                        and prices involved so that necessary approval may be obtained from
                        Reconstruction Finance Corporation subsidiary here.</p>
                    <p>The comments made above concerning air transportation are equally applicable
                        to bristles and tung oil.</p>
                    <p>With respect to silk, no immediate problem is foreseen from the point of view
                        of the United States Government. The War Production Board have agreed to the
                        British proposal that no United States purchases of silk be made for the
                        present, thus leaving the way open to the British to purchase without
                        competition from the United States. Accordingly you are requested to advise
                        your British colleague that the United States Government does not intend for
                        the present to make any silk purchases. However, if you believe that the
                        British cannot buy and transport all of the raw silk available, please
                        telegraph your views as to the procedure which should be followed in order
                        that the greatest amount of silk can be moved out of China.</p>
                    <p>The Department assumes that any action taken in conjunction with General
                        Stilwell, looking to the movement of materials out of China, will be
                        coordinated with continued movement to this country, either through
                        representatives of General Stilwell’s Mission or through representatives of
                        the Maritime Commission. In the latter connection, McKay, a representative
                        of the Maritime Commission, is on his way to Chungking to confer with
                        General Stilwell. (See Department’s 145 of March 3.<note n="9"
                            xml:id="d538fn9">Not printed.</note>)</p>
                    <p>Please advise the Department urgently of any obstacles which may stand in the
                        way of prompt movement of these materials, and also please keep the
                        Department advised as to developments.</p>

                        <item>General Stilwell appreciates the importance of coordinating the
                            movement of strategic materials out of China with the movement of
                            materials into China, and expresses the desire to cooperate in
                            facilitating such coordination subject to any possible prior demands of
                            an immediate military character. His mission will be in control of
                            transport planes but he has no assurance that such planes will be in
                            operation by April. He approves Myitkyina and Yunnanyi as points at
                            which stocks of materials now in Burma and China should be assembled by
                            the Chinese [apparent omission] and eventual land transport to Ledo

                            transportation of future stocks to designated points. The anticipated
                            production for 1942, besides stocks now available, is: tungsten 15 to
                            20,000 metric tons and tin 7,000 tons. There are no figures on antimony
                            as the Chinese are non-producing because they do not plan to make
                            shipments. There is apparent some lack of appreciation on the part of
                            Chinese officials of the need for energetic action. The Embassy, bearing
                            this in mind, will tactfully exert pressure for action.</item>

                            indications of Chinese disinclination to undertake responsibility for
                            arrangements for and supervision of transport through India and possibly
                            Burma. It may be necessary and advisable for us to assume that

                        <item>Embassy believes that direct contracts by a Governmental agency should
                            serve to expedite transportation of bristles and tung oil and suggests
                            that the contracts be made in America with the Fooshing representative
                            Universal Trading Corporation for f. a. s. delivery Bombay in effort to
                            induce Chinese to complete Indian organization. There are 50,000 tons of
                            tung oil and 310 tons of bristles in stock and 140,000 tons of tung oil
                            and 1,250 tons of bristles to become available during the year. The
                            Chinese will be urged to move stocks to points on the road for
                            transportation by air in the case of bristles, and by truck in the case
                            of tung oil, when transportation to Assam becomes possible.</item>

                        <item>The matter of silk has been discussed with the British Embassy which
                            had radioed London for advice as to the quantities desired. There are
                            now 200 bales in stock and 5,000 bales will be available during the
                            year. The British will no doubt meet with difficulty in arranging for
                            transportation of such quantities as they desire. The Department will be
                            informed of this Embassy’s views when the British position is
                            clarified.</item>

                        <item>[<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] With regard to new roads, [it] is hoped
                            that the section between Lungling and Myitkyina will be completed within
                            2 months and that an all weather road from Myitkyina via Tinghai to Ledo
                            will be completed by August. The completion within these time limits is
                            largely a matter of speculation, and is dependent primarily upon the
                            energy with which work is pressed.</item>

                        <item>McKay, who has cooperated in obtaining the foregoing information,
                            requests that substance of this telegram be communicated to Maritime
                            Commission.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>It is clear from the foregoing that the principal obstacle to prompt
                            movement of the materials is the lack of either land or air transport
                            through to Assam. Trucks cannot proceed to Assam until roads are
                            completed and transport by air must await arrival of planes from the
                            United States. There are now no planes available for transport of cargo.
                            Embassy will exert every effort to have the Chinese assemble the stocks
                            where they can be transported to Assam when facilities become available,
                            and will keep the Department advised as to developments.</item>

                        <item>The Department is gratified that General Stilwell will make
                            arrangements for the coordination of the exports of materials from China
                            with the imports of materials into China. You are requested to keep the
                            Department informed as to the plans for the use of transport planes,
                            especially as to (1) the amounts of materials which these planes will be
                            able to transport monthly outward from China; the estimates if possible
                            to be given by months for 12 months from the date the service will
                            start, and (2) the points which will be covered by this air service. The
                            Department understands from your 251 that the present plans are that
                            these points will be Sadiya, Myitkyina and Yunnanyi. It is assumed that
                            rail transport will be used from Sadiya across India to Bombay and
                            Karachi. Please keep the Department informed fully as to this whole
                            transportation program.</item>

                        <item>Tungsten. The Metals Reserve Company has made contracts with the
                            National Resources Commission whereby 75 percent of the purchase price
                            of tungsten will be paid in cash to the Chinese Government, the other 25
                            percent being applied on the Export-Import Bank loans. It is understood
                            that this purchasing program is producing the maximum amounts of
                            tungsten. Please report your latest estimate as to the total amounts
                            which will be produced and shipped during the forthcoming year by
                            quarters.</item>

                            Resources Commission to buy an aggregate of 36,000 tons of tin. However,
                            it is understood that the British are taking up in London with the
                            Chinese and Russian Ambassadors there a proposal to divert to Russia the
                            total production of 1942 tin in China in consideration of a
                            corresponding reduction in the amount of tin which the United States and
                            Great Britain will make available to Russia during 1942. If this plan
                            should go through the export of tin to us by the air route may be
                            disregarded. Please telegraph the estimated tin production of China for
                            1942.</item>

                            acquiring the 310 tons of bristles in stock and the 1,250 tons of
                            bristles to be produced during 1942. The Reconstruction Finance
                            Corporation is currently discussing this with the Universal Trading
                            Company here.</item>

                        <item>Silk. It seems obvious that if we can provide the transportation and
                            the British cannot it would be desirable for us to acquire the silk and
                            bring it out of China. We will require, however, full information as the
                            quality of the 200 bales in stock and the 5,000 bales to be available
                            during the year. A preliminary report of the War Production Board here
                            informs the Department that yellow Chinese silk coming from Szechwan
                            province is as good silk as any white silk which is produced. Are the
                            stocks and production to which you refer in your telegram from this
                            province and are they of high grade? If not what is their comparable
                            quality to high grade Szechwan yellow silk? If your report as to quality
                            is satisfactory the Reconstruction Finance Corporation will decidedly
                            want to acquire it. With whom should the negotiations be

                            shipped and on quantities that could be produced and shipped. If you
                            agree with Mr. McKay, please telegraph whether such investigators may be
                            obtained in China or whether it is necessary to send them to China from
                            the United States. Please also state your recommendations as to how many
                            men should be required and what their qualifications should be.</item>

                    <p>380. Reference paragraph 1 of the Department’s 258, April 4, 7 p.m. There are
                        no planes available for transport of materials from China and there is as
                        yet indefinite information in Chungking regarding when transport planes will
                        arrive from America for duty. Ground work on fields to enable regular
                        operations will not be completed before June 1st. With regard to (1) General
                            Magruder<note n="15" xml:id="d542fn15">Gen. John A. Magruder, head of

                        on the basis of present information to estimate amount of outward cargo
                        planes will be able to transport monthly. With regard to (2) the
                        Department’s understanding is correct with the modification that fields in
                        Assam will be about equi-distant from Sadiya and Ledo near railhead. The
                        Department’s assumption regarding rail transport across India is

                            Kwangtung can without much difficulty find its way into Japanese hands
                            and if shipment out of China to the United States is impossible it is
                            not unlikely that, rather than stopping production, [producers?] may
                            connive in smuggling wolfram through to the coast for sale to the
                            Japanese.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Chairman of N. R. C. has stated that he will find it difficult to justify
                        continued government financing of mineral production in the face of
                        prolonged interruption of transport facilities and impossibility of sale to
                        us. Having in mind his position and believing it desirable to prevent
                        tungsten and possibly other minerals from falling into Japanese hands,
                        Embassy suggests for consideration a plan whereby we might purchase the
                        Chinese production of tungsten, tin and possibly antimony for delivery and
                        storage at such convenient and safe points as Kunming or Yunnanyi and
                        Lingling along the Chinese section of the Burma Road where they would be
                        ready for transport out of China when facilities become available. For such
                        a plan, it would be advisable to have a man such as described in paragraph 3
                        above. McKay himself, Embassy believes, would be qualified. It would also be
                        advisable to have one experienced mining engineer. There is in Chungking
                        Sergei Lavrov, American, whom Embassy believes to be well qualified. He has
                        prepared for the Embassy a very useful memorandum on strategic minerals in
                        China which is being forwarded to Department by air mail. These two
                        Americans or others with semi-war qualifications would be sufficient either
                        to carry out the plan outlined above and/or to do the work suggested by
                        McKay.</p>

                            Much of this information is, no doubt, known to you, but we repeat it

                            bales are at Kunming, 500 bales are at Kyeiyang, and 500 bales at
                            Chungking; and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) for the whole of the 1942 crop
                            of same grades, which it is estimated would amount to 5,000 additional

                            the British Silk Control’s arrangement for purchase. Especially is this
                            true since we are informed that the British Silk Control has a group of
                            experts in Chungking who have been carrying on these
                            negotiations.</item>

                        <item>However, the question of the transportation method referred to in
                            paragraph 1 of the Department’s 258 must be considered in this
                            connection. All silk is subject to the order of the Combined Raw
                            Materials Board sitting in Washington which allocates silk as between
                            the British Empire and the United States in accordance with their
                            respective war needs. It accordingly makes little difference who buys
                            the silk. However it is understood that the decision has been made that
                            only goods owned by the United States Government will be covered by the
                            method referred to in paragraph 1 of the Department’s 258.</item>

                        <item>With respect to the whole question of transportation referred to in
                            the Department’s 258 insofar as it affects all strategic materials to be
                            brought out of China, the question of cost must be considered and the
                            Department requests that you telegraph whether the transportation of the
                            materials from China to the point where the service referred to in the
                            first paragraph of the Department’s 258 of April 4 will end would be
                            without charge. The desirable solution would be to have the Chinese
                            producers carry the cost of transportation up to the point of delivery
                            to the place of departure of the services referred to above and to have
                            payment made by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, f. o. b. that
                            point. If this can be arranged, the existing contracts between the
                            Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the National Resources Commission
                            and other agencies of the Chinese Government will be modified
                            accordingly. Please telegraph fully on this point.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>In connection with the foregoing, it will also be necessary to know

                    <p>466. Paragraph 4 of Embassy’s 425, April 17, 3 p.m. The National Resources
                        Commission has approached the Embassy with the request that Myitkyina and/or
                        Yunnanyi be agreed upon as points of delivery for Chinese strategic metals.
                        The N. R. C. is anxious to avoid cost and risk of shipment across India and
                        wants payment for delivery alongside planes at the above mentioned points.
                        It will provide personnel for handling forwarding through India if we desire
                        but wishes to avoid financial responsibilities. General Magruder of the
                        American Military Mission expressed the opinion some time ago that United
                        States Army personnel in India which is organized to handle incoming war
                        materials could handle forwarding of outgoing strategic materials. The N. R.
                        C. requests an early reply and states that details may be worked out with
                        its Foreign Trade Office representative in New York.</p>
                    <p>The N. R. C. request has been foreshadowed in the attitude of the Chairman of
                        the Commission recently. It is motivated by a desire to obtain prompt
                        payment for metals and by an apparent lack of confidence in the prospective
                        arrangements for transportation through Burma and India.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy has again urged the N. R. C. to make haste in transporting stocks
                        of strategic metals in Burma and at Wanting to Myitkyina and those in China
                        to Yunnanyi for air transport when planes are available.</p>

                            642</ref>.</note> British Embassy has been notified by London that they
                        are not to compete with us in buying bristles. However, there are more
                        bristles on the <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0658"/>market and in
                        prospect than mentioned in the Department’s reference and the Universal
                        Trading Corporation does not control all stocks. The Russians are also in
                        the market for bristles. British Embassy suggests that unified policy of
                        efficiency might be achieved if trained persons in Jardine Matheson’s office
                        here were charged with the task of procuring bristles for all Allies under
                        the direction of the Embassy.</p>
                    <p>2. Reference paragraph 6 of Department’s 258 [and] 3 of its 295.<note n="17"

                            645</ref>.</note> The silk stocks so mentioned come from various parts
                        of China and are not of uniform grade. Jardine Matheson on behalf of British
                        authorities has already purchased 1000 bales of silk, is negotiating for
                        another 1000 and plans to take all of this year’s crop that is acceptable.
                        The silk mentioned in Embassy’s 251, March 20, is included in the foregoing
                        stocks.</p>
                    <p>3. Embassy knows of no decision that only materials owned by the United
                        States Government would be carried on transport planes to Assam. In fact
                        when the matter of transport was discussed with General Stilwell (paragraph
                        1 of Embassy’s 251) it was understood that transported stocks would be
                        property of Chinese Government agency until arrival at Indian ports. The
                        discussion was then in regard to strategic metals, but it is not believed
                        that a different rule would apply ex-British owned silk.</p>
                    <p>4. Paragraph 6 of Department’s 295. The transport planes insofar as Embassy
                        is informed will be operated by the United States Army under General
                        Stilwell who has indicated that if charges are to be made arrangements
                        therefor should be made in Washington. The Embassy concurs in the opinion
                        that China should bear transportation costs to points alongside planes and
                        purchaser bear costs thereafter. (See paragraph 4 of Embassy’s 425, April 17
                        and its 466 of April 26.)</p>
                    <p>5. After careful consideration of all factors and circumstances, including
                        attitude of interested Chinese authorities, Embassy has come to the
                        conclusion that solution of the problem lies in formation of joint
                        purchasing agency in China with a limited but technically proficient
                        personnel to operate in behalf of all Allies. This agency should be headed
                        by someone experienced in dealing with Chinese officials. Embassy might be
                        able to obtain the services of a qualified American businessman now in
                        China. Under the agent there should be a technician to supervise purchase of
                        metals (Embassy has suggested Lavrov as qualified) and a technician to
                        supervise purchase of silk, bristles and possible tung oil (local staff of
                        Jardine Matheson is qualified for this task). The purchasing agent would
                        conduct negotiations with the Chinese for purchase of materials and their
                        forwarding to places for air transport and maintain close contact with
                        American military authorities in control of transport planes. Appointment of
                            <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0659"/>agent as officer of this
                        Embassy might facilitate his work. The British Embassy approves this
                        suggested organization and would give the agent full cooperation. The Soviet
                        Embassy might wish to have representation in the organization or at least
                        maintain liaison with it.</p>
                    <p>6. It is obvious that the course of military events in Burma will have a
                        decisive bearing on the transport problem. However, even should transport
                        out of China be impossible for a time it is believed that materials should
                        be purchased and held in storage until transportation is possible.</p>

                        <item>With respect to tungsten, Metals Reserve Company is prepared to
                            consider favorably modification of its agreement with the National

                            should be subject to reconsideration by Metals Reserve Company when

                            is understood that of the estimated potential tin production of 10,000
                            tons (see your 425, paragraph 2), 6,000 tons per annum have been
                            allocated by the Combined Raw Materials Board in Washington to Russia
                            and will be delivered direct to Russia. A proposal to allocate the
                            entire production of Chinese tin to Russia is being examined, but a
                            decision has not yet been made. In the meantime please inform the
                            Department (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) whether an agreement to accept tin
                            against delivery alongside planes would increase the amount of tin which
                            would be delivered to the Metals Reserve Company, assuming the
                            allocation of the balance over 6,000 tons per annum to Russia does not
                            take place; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) if so by how much estimated
                            tonnage per annum; and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) whether there is any
                            preclusive factor in making such an arrangement, namely, whether such an
                            agreement would divert to Metals Reserve tin which might otherwise go to
                            the enemy.</item>

                        <item>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Inasmuch as the British are leaving to us
                            purchase of Chinese bristles, it is suggested that you may wish to
                            consult with the Soviet Embassy with a view to an understanding whereby
                            Russians would not enter bristles market beyond the possible purchase of
                            a certain <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0662"/>stipulated quantity.
                            It would also be desirable to effect an arrangement for the coordination
                            of prices. Defense Supplies Corporation is specifying “assortment No.
                            27” for which $3 per pound is regarded as fair price. Please report as
                            to feasibility of effecting any understanding as above described.</item>

                        <item>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Negotiations are proceeding here between
                            Defense Supplies and Universal Trading Corporation for purchase of
                            bristles, but prices asked are regarded as too high. Defense Supplies
                            has also discussed bristles purchase here with a Vice President of
                            Jardine Matheson, who has agreed to submit offers. Pending further
                            developments, purchasing agent in China is not regarded as necessary,
                            but the Department would be glad to be informed of any American suitable
                            for this purpose in case such agency should later be found
                            desirable.</item>

                            please reply more specifically, if possible, to the questions asked in
                            the Department’s 258. What the Department desires to know in brief is
                            whether there are stocks of silk which, although not of the high grade
                            being bought by the British as suitable for parachutes, might
                            nevertheless be purchased by the American Government for powder

                            agency alongside planes. It is also our understanding that an
                            arrangement is being made where title of British purchased silk would be
                            transferred to Defense Supplies and retransferred to the British upon
                            arrival of silk in India.</item>

                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>With reference to your recommendation for a joint purchasing agency in
                            China, the existing situation, as known to the Department, is as
                            follows: Metals Reserve Company already has 5-year contracts covering
                            purchase of tungsten, tin, and antimony, c.i.f. USA. Combined Raw
                            Materials Board has already decided to divert direct to Russia 5000–6000
                            tons of Chinese tin, and it is possible entire Chinese tin production
                            will be thus diverted. See Department’s no. 349, Paragraph 2. There is
                            at present no intention to make new arrangements regarding antimony
                            although the question is being studied. No contract has been made
                            covering wood oil and difficulties of transport and other considerations
                            rule out this commodity at present. Silk is to be purchased by the
                            British and bristles are to be bought as described in Paragraph 1 above.
                            Thus it appears that all of the commodities in which we are interested
                            are being purchased either by the British <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653"
                                facs="0663"/>or ourselves. In these circumstances, we feel that a
                            joint purchasing agency is hardly necessary, but will be glad to
                            consider any further observations on your part. However, it is
                            recognized that some sort of organization of our own is necessary in
                            order to supervise reception and transportation of materials as well as
                            to pass upon technical matters. It is for this reason that the
                            Department is interested in the possible employment of McKay and Lavrov,
                            as outlined in our no. 349 Paragraph 4.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>The Department heartily agrees with your conclusion in regard to the
                            acquisition and storage of materials; for it is obvious that we must
                            endeavor at this time, not only to give all reasonable material
                            assistance to the Chinese, but also every moral encouragement to their
                            war effort.</item>

                    <p>402. Your No. 523, May 7, 1 p.m. and No. 534, May 9, noon. Do you consider
                        that there is a danger either that stocks of tin within China may fall into
                        enemy hands or that the tin mines themselves are threatened? If so, the
                        Department would be glad to receive any suggestion as to the better
                        safeguarding of the stocks and mines and in particular your opinion on the
                        desirability of amending existing tin contracts with China so as to provide
                        for full payment by the United States upon the delivery of tin to points
                        within China to be specified by the Embassy from time to time as either safe
                        or preferably as safe and suitable for subsequent shipment to Russia.</p>

                            inquires whether he would be prepared to delay trip sufficiently to
                            complete arrangements with National Resources Commission regarding
                            procedures for weighing, sampling, storage, etc., and also to arrange
                            for representation for Metals Reserve in his absence. Since it would be
                            difficult to arrange for transportation to China of a qualified

                            him select such a substitute in China. It is understood here that McKay
                            will not be available in China until after June 15 at earliest as War
                            Shipping Administration requires him in India.”</p>

                        <item>Embassy’s object in suggesting that we purchase tin alongside plane in
                            China was to prevent reduction in production because of Chinese
                            inability to deliver for purchase outside of China due to transport
                            interruption. It would seem reasonable, if tin is to be delivered to
                            Russia, for Russians to arrange purchase in China, we placing at their
                            disposal such transport facilities out of China through India as we may
                            have available if transport via that route is contemplated. However, if
                            existing contracts and understanding with Russia render purchase by
                            United States preferable, Embassy recommends purchase in China. Metals
                            Reserve is no doubt aware that, due to artificially high rate at which
                            Chinese dollar is pegged to the United States dollar and to very low
                            internal value of Chinese dollar, price of tin in Kunming is about three
                            times higher than New York quotations.</item>

                            <p>“With further reference to the subject matter of our telegram of May
                                15, 1942, No. 391, Defense Supplies Corporation has purchased 4,000

                                facilities for onward transportation are available. At latter point
                                Waddell will take possession for Defense Supplies and arrange for

                                If this plan feasible, Embassy or Consul should obtain certificate
                                and warehouse receipt simultaneously and cable advice, to that

                        approached Embassy with offer to transport tin or tungsten from Kunming to

                        involved would not be large. Metals Reserve may wish consider offer.
                        American military transport planes are now taking out limited quantities of
                        tin and will start moving tungsten soon.</p>

                    <p>626. Reference paragraph 1 of Department’s 391, May 15, 3 p.m. Embassy has
                        learned from Russian trade representative here that Russian bristles
                        requirements for 1942 are not expected to exceed 300 tons of an estimated
                        Chinese production of 1500 tons. Russians are understood to have purchased
                        from Fooshing recently 900 cases of no. 27 for delivery to Lanchow.
                        Representative considers $3 alongside plane Kunming a fair price for no. 27
                        assortment. He was favorably disposed toward suggestion of an understanding
                        with regard to stipulation of quantities and coordination of prices but felt
                        that such understanding might be more expeditiously reached in

                        <item>The Department has had in mind that first priority for outgoing
                            airplane shipments to India should be given to tungsten, silk, and
                            bristles, without preference of one over the other, it being expected
                            that mixed cargoes of these three materials would be the most effective
                            method of transport. In view of limited extent of this service, the
                            Department has not counted upon export of tin, antimony, or other
                            Chinese products by air to India.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Combined Raw Materials Board has decided to allocate to Russia entire
                            exportable surplus of Chinese tin from now until June 30, 1943. Present
                            plan (which has not yet been fully worked out) contemplates that Metals
                            Reserve Company will modify existing tin contracts with the CNRC—in a
                            manner similar to that followed with the tungsten contracts—so as to
                            provide for the purchase of the tin in storage points in China to be
                            agreed upon by the Chinese and Soviet authorities, subject to your
                            approval. Tin would then be made available to Soviet Russia under
                            provisions of Lend-Lease and Soviet authorities would undertake
                            transport of tin from points of purchase by northwest caravan route to
                            Russia. These arrangements are being perfected and you will be kept
                            informed of their progress. If successfully completed, this arrangement
                            would seem to obviate danger of reduced production referred to in your
                            paragraph 2.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>In view of Japanese tin holdings, there seems no preclusive aspect in
                            purchase of this metal. However, should plan above outlined prove
                            abortive (which it is believed is unlikely), the Department will
                            nevertheless give consideration to purchase of tin at suitable points in
                            China in the hope that India air service may become sufficiently
                            extended or that other means of transport may eventually be found. Your
                            opinion on this point is desired, as well as any comments you may have
                            to offer on the plan in general.</item>

                        <item>The Department desires that you do all in your power to see to it that
                            no available space is unused on outgoing planes. As has been stated
                            above first priority must be given to tungsten, bristles and <pb n="658"
                                xml:id="pg_658" facs="0668"/>silk and you are accordingly requested
                            to use every effort to fill up all available space with these products,
                            disregarding where necessary formalities as to inspection as well as
                            other technicalities. If despite your efforts in this regard there still
                            remains empty space, tin may be loaded but this should be done only as a
                            last resort and after every effort has been made to fill the space with
                            tungsten, bristles and silk.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>It is to be assumed that the amount of available outgoing plane space
                            from China will increase. You are accordingly requested to do everything
                            possible to coordinate the delivery of tungsten, bristles and silk to
                            points alongside planes so that all of the available cargo space will be
                            utilized to transport these commodities. You are requested to inform the
                            Department fully as to the plans for this coordination of shipments and
                            to telegraph the Department generally on the whole subject covered by

                    <p>817. Your 603, July 7. The answer to inquiry in second paragraph is
                        affirmative. Embassy has not been able to ascertain what part of this year’s
                        production earmarked for Russia is actually ready for export to Russia.
                        Transportation to Lanchow is, as with other materials, the principal
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>Irrespective of commitments to Russia, there are now in and near Kunming,
                        according to information given Yincent while he was in Kunming by Director
                        of Foreign Trade Office of National Resources Commission, actually 75 tons
                        (rather than 35 tons as mentioned in Embassy’s 691, June 11) readily
                        available for export to United States. The Director has made an offer in
                        writing to sell this mercury to us f. o. b. plane Kunming for United States
                        dollars 194 per flask and has suggested that, due to difficulty opening and
                        sealing flasks, sampling be done in New York and arrangement be made to
                        accept gross weight in Kunming as provisional basis for payment of 65% of
                        the agreed price.</p>

                        Japanese hands. If the Russians acquire these stocks, please suggest that
                        they be transported by northwest route at early date. Keep the Department
                        informed.</p>

                        and, (3) price.</p>
                    <p>Kwok states that present stocks more than ample, considering limited
                        transport facilities in China, for shipments to Russia via Sinkiang.
                        National Resources Commission hopes to be able to deliver some 2,000 tons of
                        tin and tungsten to Hami for Russians by the end of this year, but is not
                        confident that available transport will enable it to do so.</p>
                    <p>In view of the limited air transport facilities out of Kunming (about 75 tons
                        a week now with prospects of increase uncertain) it seems to Embassy that
                        decision regarding purchase of tin depends on whether tungsten or tin is
                        more urgently needed. Preclusive or psychological factors should not play
                        part in decision.</p>
                    <p>Kwok requests information regarding purchase arrangements 51 tons of tin
                        shipped from Kunming in June (see Kunming’s telegram 39).</p>

                    <p>1032. Department’s 736, August 15, 8 p.m. National Resources Commission is
                        becoming increasingly concerned that it will not be able to supply
                        sufficient quantities of wolfram at Kunming to load outgoing planes which
                        took lot 670 tons in August (624 tons of wolfram) and which may have space
                        in September for 1000 tons and perhaps more in October. Director of NRC
                        undertakes to provide wolfram as rapidly as possible but desires that
                        arrangement be made for shipment of tin if wolfram in sufficient quantity is
                        not available. There are now 1000 tons of refined tin available at Kunming.
                        Embassy has informed NRC that matter has been referred to Metals Reserve.
                        Embassy assumes that, if Metals Reserve agrees to take tin, terms with
                        regard to price, quality, etc., will be settled in Washington and that
                        authorization will be given for CNAC to transport tin to Dinjan for $750 per
                        ton as in the case of wolfram.</p>

                    <p>1085. Department’s 838, September 15, midnight. Small quantity of silk
                        shipped from China due to inability of British to obtain <pb n="665"
                            xml:id="pg_665" facs="0675"/>supplies. There is no accumulation of silk
                        at Kunming awaiting shipment. Shipment of mercury, which was urgently
                        required by Russia, at no time interfered with shipment of silk. Only 40
                        tons were involved. It would appear that maximum amount of silk which the
                        British may be able to obtain remainder of this year will not exceed 100
                        tons. Air freight space for this quantity will be readily available.</p>

                    <p>854. With reference to your no. 1032 of September 14, 9 a.m. Metals Reserve
                        refers to the increase in available plane space from Kunming and to the
                        possibility of its exceeding tungsten ore ready for shipment, Company
                        desires to have your comments and those of Mr. Fritz as to any measures that
                        might serve to increase the incentive for the National Resources Commission
                        to move tungsten ore to Kunming.</p>
                    <p>If the available plane space is as great as indicated Metals Reserve assumes
                        that some tin will be shipped as production of tungsten ore is presumably
                        not at present running at an annual rate of 12,000 tons. However, the
                        tungsten is so much preferred to tin that the company wishes to insure that
                        all available tungsten is moved. Any suggestion for action by the Metals
                        Reserve will be very much appreciated. In particular do you think that
                        tungsten supplies could be increased (1) if the price were raised to $22.60
                        a short ton unit instead of $19.50 (price would probably have to be limited
                        to this maximum because of commitments to other countries) (2) if the
                        percentage paid for tungsten ore in warehouses were increased from the
                        present 65% to say 80%.</p>
                    <p>Thus far as stated in the Department’s 823 of September 11 company has
                        informed National Resources Commission that it is not prepared to modify
                        contract regarding purchase of Chinese tin. This contract provides for
                        payment only after tin is delivered at New York.</p>
                    <p>However, Combined Raw Materials Board has recommended that Chinese tin be
                        allocated to India to the extent of 1,100 tons per annum or to Russia.
                        Therefore tin contract probably should be modified so as to provide for
                        payment F. O. B. Dinjan. In as much as the air freight from Kunming to
                        Dinjan on CNAC planes is almost as much as the value of the tin, it would be
                        preferable if tin were not transported on commercial planes but only by
                        planes of the army.</p>
                    <p>Metals Reserve Company will appreciate your early comments.</p>

                        of year, there does not appear to be much likelihood that available plane
                        space will exceed cargo. Beginning next year it may be advisable to devise

                        discussed several times with Yin of the National Resources Commission
                        amending contract for purchase of tin under which company would accept
                        delivery at a point within China. A letter has been addressed to Yin in the
                        following sense.</p>
                    <p>As air transport facilities from China to India will tend to increase, Metals
                        Reserve has desired to make arrangement which will increase quantities
                        tungsten ore delivered at Kunming airport and which will provide basis for
                        settling for such tin metal as may utilize plane space not required for
                        tungsten.</p>
                    <p>To attain these objectives company is prepared amend contract as follows: <list>

                    </p>
                    <p>Yin’s initial reaction has not been favorable. He appears to desire
                        arrangement for 60 cents per pound for tin f. o. b. planes Kunming,
                        asserting that China should receive treatment equal to that given Bolivia.
                        As Bolivian tin is being bought at available ocean ports Metals Reserve
                        believes that even if desirable it would not be possible <pb n="668"

                        which would in every sense be equivalent to the treatment accorded to
                        Bolivia.</p>
                    <p>Embassy will note that company has voluntarily stated willingness to increase
                        price of tungsten and also to pay higher proportion of the value of the
                        tungsten when notified that the metal has been delivered.</p>
                    <p>If it is felt desirable Embassy may give foregoing information to National
                        Resources Commission. However, whether or not matter is discussed with
                        members of the Commission, Metals Reserve would appreciate Embassy’s
                        comments. Furthermore company would like to have regular reports of any
                        information obtained in regard to the trend of production of tungsten.</p>

                    <p>1315. Department’s 1017, October 31, 7 p.m. For Metals Reserve. Matters in
                        reference telegram have been discussed with official of National Resources
                        Commission who was already informed regarding proposed alteration of
                        tungsten contract and discussion with respect to tin. Quite naturally he
                        adopted same attitude as Mr. Yin with regard to tin price rather
                        unconvincingly supporting contention that China should receive same price as
                        Bolivia. It is true that Chinese production cost of tin in terms of United
                        States dollars is high but this is due to unrealistic rate between Chinese
                        and United States dollars (20 to 1 when 80 to 1 would be more in line with
                        actual value). Thus production cost of 80,000 Chinese dollars per ton
                        becomes United States dollars 4,000. With regard to your subparagraph 3,
                        Chinese are not in a position to consider making deliveries to ports on the
                        west coast of India.</p>
                    <p>In discussions on tin, it should be borne in mind that it is impracticable to
                        refine Yunnan tin, which forms bulk of Chinese tin, to standard quality of
                        99.8 or even 99.7. The quality varies between 99 and 99.6. Tin produced in
                        Kwangsi (about 2000 tons annually) can be refined to 99.7 and sometimes
                        higher. But the tin which the Chinese contemplate our taking is from the
                        stocks in Yunnan where about 10,000 tons are refined annually.</p>
                    <p>Reference is made to Embassy’s telegrams number 1247, October 31, 9 a.m. [<hi
                            rend="italic">1 p.m.</hi>] and 1293, November 6, 11 a.m.<note n="35"
                            xml:id="d578fn35">Latter not printed.</note> The Russians are anxious to
                        take all the Chinese tin ex-warehouse Kunming that can be transported out by
                        plane. It appears that determination of <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669"
                            facs="0679"/>price to Russians is awaiting the outcome of our
                        discussions, the Chinese maintaining that the Russians should pay. It is
                        suggested that settlement in Washington of question of relative urgency of
                        Russian and our need for tin be settled before proceeding further with our
                        discussions with Chinese regarding tin.</p>
                    <p>Production of tungsten is proceeding at average rate of 1000 tons a month and
                        it is expected that this average will be maintained in 1943. However, until
                        present facilities are improved, we cannot count on delivery to planes of
                        much more than 500 tons a month. Chinese promise to take all available
                        measures to improve transportation. After handling mercury for Russia (about
                        80 tons), silk for Britain (about 15 tons) and whatever amount of long
                        length bristles, we may purchase in the future, tin for Russia and/or for
                        United States would constitute balance of cargo for planes to make up
                        deficiency of tungsten cargo.</p>

                        80 tons of mercury and 750 tons of tin is approved provided that supplies

                    <p>1390. Department’s 1086, November 14, 11 [<hi rend="italic">7</hi>] p.m.,
                        strategic materials. CNRC representative informs Embassy that agreement has
                        been reached in Washington whereby Metals Reserve undertakes to accept tin
                        deliveries f. o. b. planes Kunming in an amount not exceeding 50% of wolfram
                        deliveries. Embassy requests confirmation, and clarification on following
                        point: Is it intended that tin will be accepted irrespective of available
                        plane space for export (that is, for storage if planes are fully utilized
                        for other cargo) or tin not to exceed 50% of wolfram delivered will be
                        accepted only as it is required to fill outgoing plane space? As matters now
                        stand, troops will continue to occupy most of space for several weeks to
                        come. When this operation is completed, accumulated wolfram, and mercury and
                        tin for Russia will fully utilize space for over a month. Hence it is not
                        likely on present priorities that tin shipments for us would be made before
                        February and, since tin is readily available at Kunming, acceptance of
                        deliveries need not commence until that time.</p>

                    <p>1406. Strategic materials. There would appear to be no practical manner in
                        which Metals Reserve might assist, as suggested in your 1148, November 25,
                        10 p.m., in improving transportation of wolfram, although Embassy will
                        mention suggestion to Metals Reserve Company in hope that it might bring
                        forth greater endeavor to organize transport more effectively.</p>
                    <p>Regarding tin it is pertinent to note that even after delivery of 750 tons of
                        tin for Russia (Embassy’s 1247, October 31, 1 p.m.) Chinese fall short of
                        making full deliveries in accordance with 1942 agreement. Sino-Soviet 1943
                        agreement calls for delivery by China of 4000 tons of wolfram, 2000 tons tin
                        and 200 tons mercury. Chinese will endeavor to deliver wolfram to Russians
                        in Sinkiang but it is not <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0682"/>expected
                        that they will organize such overland transport for tin and the Russians
                        desire air transport from Kunming for mercury. Therefore it would seem
                        reasonable to move tin actually contracted by Russia prior to moving tin
                        which we may take under contract for allocation to Russia. Russian tin would
                        be given priority position ahead of our tin and only question arising would
                        be priority position of 1100 tons of tin for India.</p>

                    <p>1182. Your no. 1390 of November 26, 10 a.m. Metals Reserve states that its
                        option provides that tin need not be accepted above an amount equal to 50%
                        of tungsten shipments. However, this does not mean that the tin would be
                        shipped if there were enough tungsten available to take all plane space. The
                        limitation is to apply only at our option in case there is insufficient
                        tungsten to fill plane space.</p>

                    <p>1564. For Metals Reserve. Wolfram deliveries are not coming up to
                        expectations and we are again faced with the prospect of outgoing planes not
                        having sufficient cargo; this despite deliveries of tin in ratio of 1 to 2
                        of wolfram. NRC suggests we accept advance deliveries of tin against future
                        deliveries of wolfram. Embassy proposes to authorize the acceptance of 1,000
                        tons of tin for early delivery against promised delivery of 2,000 tons of
                        wolfram by end of April. Request prompt reply giving Metals Reserve’s
                        reaction to this proposal inasmuch as we should begin acceptances early in
                        January. This plan will meet present situation. Hope that it will be
                        unnecessary to accept further tin deliveries until 2,000 tons of wolfram are
                        delivered and that Chinese will be able to deliver 2,000 tons of wolfram in
                        the 4 months period allowed. However, if Army planes are able to take out
                        average of 1,000 tons a month as now seems possible, it will be necessary to
                        provide an additional 1,000 tons of cargo and Embassy has in mind suggesting
                        that tin under contract to Russia be used to take up slack.</p>

                            American Airways, and Bond of the C. N. A. C. All concerned agree that
                            unfortunate loss of efficiency would probably result from any attempt to
                            change at this time the set-up under which the C. N. A. C. planes are
                            being operated. The China National Aviation Corporation has an
                            outstanding record of efficiency over a long period and its operations
                            afford a shining example of successful international cooperation in the
                            field of communications and transportation. The pilots of the C. N. A.
                            C. have a notable record of loyalty and devotion to their present
                            management, having performed at times almost impossible feats in
                            maintaining communications under very difficult conditions. Any measure
                            designed to change the set-up under which those pilots have been working
                            might have highly adverse effect upon their morale.</item>

                            Chinese authorities, expressing tactfully but clearly the earnest hope
                            of this Government that nothing will be done to change at this time the
                            administrative conditions under which the planes of the C. N. A. C. are
                            so effectively discharging their task of maintaining communications
                            vital to the joint war effort of the United Nations. In so doing please

                            rights but solely by a desire, which we are confident the Chinese
                            Government shares, that an essential enterprise be operated with maximum
                            effectiveness to the advantage of all concerned.</item>

                    <p>In absence of General Stilwell, I consulted General Magruder who asked that
                        name of General Ho be not disclosed and expressed opinion that Chinese would
                        not take action without consulting American interests in advance, in which
                        opinion the Military and Naval Attachés and I do not concur. Yesterday I
                        brought matter orally and informally to the attention of the Political Vice
                        Minister of Foreign Affairs, without indicating source of information, and
                        made the friendly representations outlined in your telegram. Vice Minister
                        said he had no information on matter but would report my representations to
                        the proper quarter.</p>

                    <p>187. For the President and Acting Secretary. I have from M. X. Quinn
                        Shaughnessy, Advisor to the China Defense Supplies, the following signed
                        memorandum: <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0686"/>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Sole movement war supplies to China since fall of Rangoon as
                                follows: Since March 7, army allocated 2 C–39’s by Stilwell to fly
                                freight to China. Two hundred tons urgent medical supplies moved
                                Calcutta for shipment to Lashio. Less than 12 tons were moved by
                                army planes due to pilot illness and maintenance difficulties.
                                During same period Chinese National Airways moved 27 tons aircraft
                                parts and medical supplies from Calcutta in addition to its other
                                war cargo. Chinese National Airways has only 4 planes available, 2
                                of which were allocated to Calcutta–Chungking service.</p>
                            <p>April 8 Chinese National Airways inaugurated service from Dinjan,
                                Assam, to Myitkyina, Burma, with 2 planes moving 16 tons per day,
                                aviation gasoline and ammunition. One of the two army C–39’s
                                (carrying army passengers not freight) lost on flight from Chungking
                                to Kunming, landed 150 miles from Canton near Japanese lines.
                                Probably caused [by?] army pilots having only 300 to 400 hours.
                                Plane wrecked, Chinese National Airways mechanics endeavored to
                                salvage.</p>
                            <p>In February President allocated 100 transports ferry freight India to
                                China, 75 to army, 25 to Chinese National Airways. Three for army
                                have arrived, 6 more due. No planes delivered to Chinese National
                                Airways. Believe this delay forwarding planes due primarily to
                                discouraging reports by the army on operations’ feasibility.
                                Understand army insists on new airports and has advised Washington
                                that little freight can be carried until end of monsoon in October
                                and is making the limited freight movement only as token good
                                faith.</p>
                            <p>We now have 2,000 tons ordnance, aircraft parts, signal equipment,
                                medical supplies urgently requested Stilwell, 700 tons of which now
                                in Assam. China National Airways guarantees to move 10 tons per
                                plane per day. I doubt seriously army will move any. Because of army
                                discouraging report, shipping space from America being taken away
                                for our army now fighting in this field. Present rail movement
                                across India available but duration uncertain. If Stilwell is to be
                                aided and China supported must have improved and experienced
                                operation that will insure freight movement Karachi to China. In the
                                interest of getting the job done, I prefer to see Pan American and
                                China National Airways handle the whole business.”</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>I concur completely in Shaughnessy’s suggestion. After observing parallel
                        operations army ferry command and Pan American across Africa I am convinced
                        that expeditions and vital aid to China can most quickly and most certainly
                        be accomplished by Lease-Lend contract through army to Pan American and
                        China National Airways. Recommended White House direct army make such
                        arrangements Pan American and China National Airways fixing few days time
                        limit for consummation contracts to avoid army red tape and further delay.
                        To aid Stilwell this and the delivery of planes for purpose to China
                        National Airways and Pan American in India immediately most vital.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Welles</hi>: Reference, New Delhi’s telegram 187,
                        April 16, 3:00 p.m. Officers of the Department concerned especially with Far
                        Eastern affairs have been observing this situation very carefully and with
                        great concern. We have had only fragmentary information regarding the
                        operations of the Army ferry command: what we have had, however, has been
                        distressing, and the record of deliveries (or non-deliveries) in China is
                        clear evidence that the efforts of that command have not been effective so
                        far as getting the goods to China is concerned. We know much, however,
                        regarding the efficiency and the effectiveness of Pan American and its
                        associate, China National Airways: we can testify that for a long time and
                        in the midst of many difficulties they have done miracles in “delivering the
                        goods”.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the President would wish, before giving serious consideration
                        to the recommendations made in the telegram to have the statements of fact
                        checked against the records here (in Washington). Dr. Currie is perhaps
                        better prepared than any other one person available to make such a check. We
                        suggest that a copy of this telegram be sent immediately to Dr. Currie or
                        that it be suggested to the President that he ask Dr. Currie to make the
                        desired checkup immediately.</p>

                    <p>The number 25 was set because that is all that General Stilwell stated he
                        could handle at this time with the airway and airdrome facilities in that
                        area. However, it will be noted that we are figuring on sending a total of
                        34, hoping that provisions for utilizing the additional 9 can be made before
                        they arrive.</p>

                    <p>443. Embassy’s 383, April 10, noon. In an informal note received today Vice
                        Minister for Foreign Affairs states in substance that, having referred the
                        matter to the competent authorities, he has received their reply which is in
                        substance as follows: Certain quarters have suggested that, with a view to
                        facilitating improvement in the management of the CNAC, it be transferred to
                        the National Aeronautical Commission, but no decision has been reached and
                        the suggestion has nothing to do with military control.</p>
                    <p>It might theoretically be argued that the Aeronautical Commission is a
                        non-military, that is, non-army, organization. Practically, it is under
                        military control, is subordinate to the Military Affairs Commission, and to
                        all intents and purposes is a military organization.</p>
                    <p>There are now only 6 planes under operation by the CNAC of which 4 are
                        temporarily grounded for repairs or overhaul. The fact that CNAC with its
                        limited equipment cannot meet the many demands upon its services is
                        apparently being seized upon in some Chinese quarters as a pretext for
                        asserting that difficulties (resulting solely from limited equipment) can be
                        overcome by administrative changes. Actually the difficulties can be
                        overcome only by the receipt of additional planes and spare motors and parts
                        from the United States.</p>
                    <p>I shall reply to the Vice Minister reaffirming the position taken during my
                        conversation with him on April 9 which was in accordance with Department’s
                        259, April 4, 7 [<hi rend="italic">6</hi>] p.m.</p>

                    <p>379. Your 443, April 21, 11 a.m. For your confidential information:</p>
                    <p>The Department has been advised by General Arnold that the air service
                        between Calcutta and China and all cargo-type airplanes assigned to that
                        service are under direct control of General Stilwell and may be operated in
                        any way he sees fit and by such crews as he may select. Thirty-four such
                        aircraft have been allotted and as of April 18 six had already been
                        delivered to points east of Karachi. Three were then at Karachi and three
                        more in Africa or the Near East en route. All of these planes were scheduled
                        to have left the United States during April.</p>

                    <p>855. C. B. Joly, [Acting] Inspector General of Customs, informs me that
                        customs affairs are approaching a grave crisis because of decision of
                        government to apply the treasury law to the customs and that apart from
                        removing loan funds from control of Inspector General the step will
                        undermine the inspectorate system and disrupt the service as, under the law,
                        each customs district is treated as a financial entity which will deprive
                        the commissioner and the inspectorate of the flexibility and adaptability
                        essential to successful administration of a modern civil service on national
                        line[s]. Inspectorate would have no control over expenditures in each port;
                        expansion and retrenchment according to trade requirements would be
                        completely localized; staff remuneration and transfers would be subject to
                        local conditions; and the <hi rend="italic">raison d’être</hi> of the
                        inspectorate would disappear.</p>
                    <p>Minister of Finance<note n="2" xml:id="d595fn2">H. H. Kung.</note> has stated
                        he has no authority [to] postpone application of the law to the customs
                        (although there has already been continual postponement for several years).
                        Inspector General says it has not been possible to arrange for application
                        of the law in a form which will not completely undermine inspectorate
                        system. Note continuing efforts to that end but it is expected if he is not
                        successful he will be obliged to point out that there is no room for
                        inspectorate, that administration of service should be placed under direct
                        control of the Ministry of Finance and he and other foreign officers should
                        be paid off as it would be useless to attempt to operate under the law as
                        the service would break down and the foreign officers then would be made
                        scapegoats.</p>
                    <p>Inspector General has made no request for our intervention in the matter but
                        says he considers that the situation should be known to us and to British
                        Embassy. Being without reference library at Chungking, this Embassy is
                        unable to study the matter in the light of any treaty or other stipulations
                        but I do not believe that the existence <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681"
                            facs="0691"/>of any such stipulations would deter the Chinese Government
                        at this time from pursuing whatever course it wishes. Advice or
                        representation from the American or other governments would not likely be
                        well received.</p>
                    <p>The Treasury Law contemplates modern fiscal arrangements along lines of those
                        in well organized government administrations but in present state of China’s
                        administrative organization and development it will, if applied to the
                        customs, disrupt that service which is the one outstandingly efficient
                        organization of the government reasonably free from politics and a service
                        which through control of the customs revenues offered as security for loans
                        and indemnities has established China’s international and domestic credit on
                        a sound basis.</p>

                    <p>663. Your 855, July 20, 1 p.m. Your telegram under reference was received in
                        garbled condition and is not entirely clear. As regards the reference to
                        “the Treasury law”, please inform the Department of the official title of
                        the law in translation and the date of its promulgation, forwarding a
                        translation if obtainable by air mail.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile it is suggested that you talk over this matter informally with the
                        British Ambassador<note n="3" xml:id="d596fn3">Sir Horace James
                            Seymour.</note> and with Mr. Currie<note n="4" xml:id="d596fn4">Lauchlin
                            Currie, Administrative Assistant to President Roosevelt, at this time in
                            China on a special mission.</note> who, as you know, has been specially
                        interested in various aspects of Chinese financial matters and who may
                        assumably discuss some of those matters with Chinese officials. It occurs to
                        us that in connection with such discussions Mr. Currie might, if such action
                        should seem advisable, make comment to Chinese officials which would be
                        helpful in regard to this matter.</p>
                    <p>We incline to the view expressed by you in the third paragraph of your
                        telegram that representations, especially formal representations, might not
                        be well received. We therefore suggest that in any approach that may be made
                        it would be desirable not to adopt a too insistent attitude and to present
                        our views not in legalistic terms or in terms of national or private
                        economic interests but in terms of the fact that the Chinese Maritime
                        Customs as it now functions is a sound institution which has demonstrated
                        its advantages to China and to all concerned over a long period of time.</p>

                    <p>British Ambassador has called on me with Inspector General of Customs
                        regarding this matter. We agreed that any formal or informal representations
                        would be without avail but that we might each take any opportunity that
                        presents from time to time in our conversations with influential members of
                        the Government to express our interest and concern for the continued
                        integrity of the customs service as of outstanding importance to China. We
                        urged Inspector General to continue his efforts to obtain reasonable
                        modification of the application of the law to the customs and have pointed
                        out that the situation does not appear to us to have reached the point where
                        the foreign staff should consider it necessary to ask to be paid off.</p>

                    <p>807. With the return to the United States of Chinese language officers
                        exchanged for Japanese diplomatic and consular officers, I recommend that
                        the Department give consideration to the possible detail of consular
                        officers to Kweilin, Kwangsi, and Sian, Shensi, requesting the Chinese
                        Government to give consent to such assignments in order to provide consular
                        officials near centers of American residence in Free China to look after the
                        interests of our nationals, it being understood of course that these places
                        are not open, and that the stationing of officers there is a temporary war
                        time expedient. The Foreign Office has consented to a British Consul General
                        being sent to the provincial capital of Kwangtung in substitution for the
                        Consul General at Canton. We might designate our officer at Kweilin as
                        substitution for Consul General at Canton, and at Sian as substitute for
                        Consul General at Hankow. These offices should have small staffs only and
                        the officers should be prepared to withdraw in advance of any Japanese
                        offensive. I have not mentioned this proposal to the Foreign Office and
                        await instructions before doing so.</p>

                        appreciate receiving your views, as requested in its telegram under
                        reference, in regard to the question of the possible opening of temporary
                        offices at Lanchow and Chengtu, as well as at Kweilin and Sian as
                        recommended by you. Lanchow, for example, might be of special importance as
                        an observation post. An office at Chengtu would, <hi rend="italic">inter
                            alia</hi>, serve the interests of a considerable number of
                        Americans.</p>
                    <p>It is suggested that, after study of the matter, and unless you <pb n="684"
                            xml:id="pg_684" facs="0694"/>perceive objection, you approach the
                        Foreign Office informally with a view to obtaining its consent to the
                        opening of such of the suggested temporary offices as seem to you advisable,
                        not of course as a matter of right, but purely as a matter of reciprocity
                        and as in the interests of both countries. If the Chinese Government should
                        prefer that any or all of the suggested new offices be considered and listed
                        as merely temporary branch offices of the consular section of the Embassy or
                        of the Consulate at Kunming, this Government would of course be disposed to
                        meet Chinese wishes in this respect.</p>
                    <p>The Department would also appreciate your opinion as to the advisability of
                        raising the Consulate at Kunming to a Consulate General.</p>

                    <p>1063. Your 837, September 15, 11 p.m. I recommend that we move slowly in
                        matter of opening new consular offices in China; two would seem to be quite
                        adequate for time being, one at Kweilin to cover unoccupied areas in the
                        east and southeast, and one at Sian or Lanchow to cover northwest, while
                        Kunming would continue to serve the southwest and west. While Americans at
                        Chengtu have wanted a consular office there for their convenience for
                        limited passport and notarial services, I cannot see the desirability of an
                        office there at this time. I am awaiting the return to Chungking of
                        Secretary Service,<note n="2" xml:id="d600fn2">John Stewart Service, Third
                            Secretary of Embassy in China.</note> now in the northwest, before
                        making a recommendation as between Sian and Lanchow. As to the proposed
                        increase in grade of Kunming office I suggest that this be held in abeyance
                        until plans for new consulates are settled unless, of course, Department has
                        a suitable Consul General awaiting immediate assignment. I have no objection
                        to proposal.</p>

                    <p>1156. Reference my 1063, September 19, 11 a.m. On September 28 I discussed
                        informally with Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs possible <pb n="685"
                            xml:id="pg_685" facs="0695"/>stationing of consular officers at Kweilin,
                        Chengtu, Sian and Lanchow. He promised to consult Generalissimo. Yesterday
                        the director of American Department of Ministry stated that Generalissimo
                        had been consulted and informed Vincent<note n="3" xml:id="d601fn3">John
                            Carter Vincent, Counselor of Embassy in China.</note> orally as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>Kweilin. Since our Consulate General at Canton has ceased to function we
                        might find it feasible to move that office to Kweilin temporarily, in which
                        case Chinese Government would be agreeable.</p>
                    <p>Lanchow. Four years ago Chinese Government refused to accede to Soviet
                        proposal to establish consulate at Lanchow but did agree that Soviet Embassy
                        might station an officer of the Embassy temporarily at Lanchow. Perhaps
                        American Government might follow same procedure, designating officer from
                        Embassy staff to reside temporarily at Lanchow during the war. If so, it
                        would be agreeable to Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>Sian. Ministry feels that if Embassy has staff officer at Lanchow there would
                        be no need for officer at Sian.</p>
                    <p>Chengtu. Stated confidentially that Chinese Government has found it necessary
                        to refuse request of another friendly government (British) to open consulate
                        at Chengtu and does not deem it wise to reopen the question.</p>
                    <p>Director American Department suggested that if arrangement proposed for
                        Kweilin and Lanchow is agreeable, the Embassy might address the Ministry
                        embodying the suggestions in form of proposal of American Government and
                        Ministry would reply affirmatively.</p>
                    <p>I comment that the Chinese are not prepared to do more than concede to us
                        what they have conceded to the British and Russians. I believe however that
                        Kweilin and Lanchow will be adequate to our needs at this time. Service is
                        still absent on his trip, delayed on account of lack of transportation. I
                        believe Lanchow will prove preferable to Sian as former has occasional air
                        service.</p>

                        reported in my 1156. With only a brief treaty regulating the subject, there
                        will be numerous important questions arising affecting our nationals and
                        their interests. Few provincial or local officials will be content to deal
                        with such matters and it is not unlikely that in some instances attempts
                        will be made to exploit the situation. Especially as all mail and
                        telegraphic communication in Free China is now very slow and there would be
                        long delay in our nationals communicating with the Embassy it would be well
                        to have consular officers in the important centers prepared to consult with
                        our nationals, to take any necessary local steps and to determine precise
                        facts and report intelligently to the Embassy. In my opinion it would be
                        well for the Chinese Government at the same time to have Commissioners of
                        Foreign Affairs at the same places competent to advise the provincial and
                        local authorities in the name of the National Government and to effect
                        immediate correction of any improper actions.</p>
                    <p>May I take the matter up with the Foreign Office on the above lines?</p>

                    <p>981. Your no. 1168, October 12, 1 p.m. The Department approves your taking up
                        this matter with the Foreign Office along the lines which you suggest.</p>
                    <p>You may mention to the Foreign Ministry that we have for some time wished to
                        increase our representation in China, especially in view of the close
                        relations between China and the United States; and that in a country of
                        China’s size and importance one consular office (Kunming) is not adequate to
                        care for the varied interests of this country and of American nationals. In
                        the light of the favorable attitude which this Government has adopted and is
                        prepared to continue toward requests of the Chinese Government for the
                        opening of Chinese consular offices in American territory, and of our need
                        for the projected offices in China, it is hoped that the Chinese Government
                        will not perceive objection to the opening of such offices not only at
                        Kweilin and Lanchow but also at Chengtu, where there are important American
                        interests, and at Sian.</p>
                    <p>You may also say that the projected offices may, if so desired, be regarded
                        as temporary and provisional only; that it is contemplated <pb n="687"
                            xml:id="pg_687" facs="0697"/>that each of the staffs will consist of not
                        more than one commissioned officer, one Chinese clerk-interpreter and the
                        necessary messengers or additional minor employees; and that if, as regards
                        Lanchow, the Chinese Government should prefer that the officer temporarily
                        stationed there be an officer of the Embassy rather than a Consul, we should
                        be agreeable thereto.</p>
                    <p>You may in your discretion point out that the opening of the new offices
                        would offer evidence to the public in the United States and China, and
                        elsewhere, of the developing of increasingly close relations between our two
                        countries and of the importance which the Government of the United States
                        attaches to those relations.</p>
                    <p>As you suggest, the forthcoming abolition of extraterritoriality not only
                        provides additional reasons for the opening of the projected new offices but
                        also raises the question whether the Chinese Foreign Office might not wish
                        to detail to or designate representatives at important centers for the
                        purpose of facilitating matters which may be expected to arise in connection
                        with the opening of the offices and their functioning and with readjustment
                        of the affairs of American nationals under the new conditions which will
                        obtain when extraterritoriality is terminated. One of the functions of the
                        new offices would be, of course, to assist American residents and travelers
                        in adjusting their affairs to such new conditions. As the term
                        “Commissioners of Foreign Affairs” may possibly have displeasing
                        connotations to the Chinese Government, it would seem preferable to avoid
                        that or any similar term in suggesting the assignment or designation of such
                        Chinese officials.</p>
                    <p>The Department much appreciates the recommendations and suggestions which you
                        have made in regard to this matter.</p>

                        Central Asian Areas</p>
                    <p>Consideration of the above-mentioned subject poses various pertinent
                        questions. Among these are: (1) the purpose of such representation; (2) the
                        nature of such representation; (3) the areas within which representation
                        might be established.</p>
                    <p>These questions are discussed below.</p>
                    <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">The purpose of such representation</hi>. American
                        consular or other official representatives have not hitherto been stationed
                        in Tibet, <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0698"/>Sinkiang, Outer Mongolia
                        or other central Asian areas, although they have from time to time traveled
                        in certain of these regions. The absence of American official representation
                        in these areas has apparently been due to a want of concrete American
                        interests therein. There appear to be neither American residents nor
                        American property interests in Tibet or Outer Mongolia. A very few American
                        missionaries have resided in Sinkiang, but it is believed that the last of
                        these withdrew from that province in 1940. The number of Americans traveling
                        in central Asian areas has never been large, and in recent years the number
                        has decreased. So far as is known, no American has traveled in Outer
                        Mongolia for several years, and only two Americans are known to have
                        traveled during recent years beyond Gyangtse in Inner Tibet.</p>
                    <p>It may not be inappropriate at this point to discuss the official
                        representation maintained by certain Powers in central Asia:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Great Britain</hi>. The British maintain a Trade Agent at
                        Gyangtse, a few stages across the Indian border on the route to Lhasa, the
                        function of whom it appears to be to keep in contact with the Tibetan
                        authorities. It appears that the Trade Agent has made trips to Lhasa from
                        time to time. It is not known whether the British maintain permanent
                        representation in Lhasa at this time, although it appears that they have not
                        done so in the past. The British have for some years maintained a consular
                        office in Kashgar, heart of the rich oasis country of southwestern Sinkiang,
                        where a few hundred Indian subjects have apparently resided for purposes of
                        trade. In all probability it has been one of the chief functions of the
                        British consular representative at Kashgar to keep the British and Indian
                        governments apprised of internal developments in Sinkiang, and also of
                        Soviet Russian activities in that province. The British maintain no official
                        representation in other parts of Sinkiang Province, nor in any part of Outer
                        Mongolia. The British formerly maintained a consular office in Tatsienlu,
                        but it was withdrawn in the early nineteen-twenties.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Soviet Union</hi>. The Soviet Union does not appear to be
                        represented in Tibet, and few if any Soviet citizens seem to have traveled
                        in that region during recent years. Soviet relations with the province of
                        Sinkiang have been close during the past ten years or so, and it appears
                        that Soviet consular representatives have been stationed in Tihwa, Kashgar
                        and perhaps other cities in Sinkiang. Soviet relations with the Mongolian
                        People’s Government in Outer Mongolia are based on certain treaties
                        concluded between the two governments during the past twenty years, which
                        among other things provide for an exchange of official representatives.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">China</hi>. China considers that Tibet and Outer Mongolia
                        form a part of the territory of the Republic of China and has accordingly
                        claimed <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0699"/>suzerainty over these
                        areas. Great Britain and the Soviet Union have by various treaties concluded
                        with China acknowledged Chinese suzerainty over Tibet and Mongolia, but
                        Great Britain and the Soviet Union have apparently interpreted “suzerainty”
                        to include a wide degree of local autonomy. It is believed, but not
                        definitely known, that there are representatives of the Mongolian and
                        Tibetan Affairs Commission of the Executive Yuan of the National Government
                        of China in Lhasa. It seems probable that there are no other Chinese
                        officials stationed in Inner Tibet unless they are to be found along the
                        Indian frontier. The provincial administration of Sinkiang has been Chinese
                        in composition, but since the establishment of the Republic has been largely
                        autonomous in character. During the last decade Soviet Russian influence
                        appears to have been dominant in the province and there seem to have been no
                        officials of the Chinese National Government regularly stationed there,
                        although a few prominent Chinese officials have made visits to the province
                        from time to time. In this connection, the recent visit of General Chiang
                        Kai-shek to Tihwa indicates that the Chinese Government is beginning to
                        reassert its influence in Sinkiang. A recent radio announcement from
                        Chungking reported the appointment by the Chinese Government of a Special
                        Commissioner for Foreign Affairs in Sinkiang. As regards Chinese relations
                        with Outer Mongolia, it appears that these have been nebulous if not
                        non-existent since the formation of the Mongolian People’s Republic in
                        1921.</p>
                    <p>In the absence of concrete or substantial American interests in central Asia,
                        particularly in the way of residents and property, it appears that the
                        establishment of American representation there would be useful chiefly for
                        purposes of observation and the submission of reports. Present-day world
                        developments, with particular reference to the fall of Burma, the German
                        drive into the Caucasus, and the potential danger of the conjunction of Axis
                        forces in central Asia, suggest for consideration the question whether or
                        not American observers should now be sent to central Asian areas to submit
                        reports relating not only to potential Axis activities in these areas but to
                        the geography, communications, politics, military affairs and economics
                        thereof. The stationing of American observers in Tibet and Sinkiang at the
                        present time might be valuable for purposes of investigating possible
                        transportation routes into China. As to Outer Mongolia, the dearth of
                        material now available in regard to that area and Manchuria and the
                        possibility of a Russo-Japanese military clash point to the desirability of
                        having qualified observers in that area.</p>
                    <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">The nature of such representation</hi>. Representation
                        might be established in central Asian areas on a permanent or a temporary
                        basis. Permanent representation, while perhaps desirable for purposes <pb
                            n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0700"/>of thorough observation and contact
                        with the local authorities, would, if feasible, require the setting up of
                        offices in remote and isolated areas. One of the most difficult problems in
                        connection with permanent representation relates to the question of <hi
                            rend="italic">agrément</hi>. In the case of Tibet and Outer Mongolia, it
                        would appear necessary to obtain the sanction of the Chinese authorities as
                        the sovereign power, while at the same time it would seem necessary to
                        receive the permission of the Tibetan and Mongolian authorities for the
                        stationing of American representatives in these areas. American
                        representatives proceeding to Tibet would probably travel through India,
                        which would require the sanction of the British and Indian authorities.
                        American representatives proceeding to Outer Mongolia would probably travel
                        via Siberia, thus necessitating the approval of the Russian authorities. A
                        formal request for the permanent stationing of American representatives in
                        Tibet and Outer Mongolia might raise embarrassing questions in regard to the
                        political status of these areas.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the complex problem of sovereignty, it is doubtful whether the
                        Tibetan or Outer Mongolian authorities would welcome the establishment of
                        permanent American representation in Lhasa or Ulan Bator (Urga). It is a
                        probability that such a request on the part of the American Government would
                        be rejected, particularly, in reference to Outer Mongolia. As regards Tibet,
                        it may be pointed out that with the establishment of an American mission at
                        New Delhi, American representatives in India are now in a much better
                        position than formerly to observe and report Tibetan developments.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the establishment of permanent American representation in
                        Sinkiang, it is believed that endeavors to carry this into effect at the
                        present time would prove a source of embarrassment to the Chinese
                        Government. While the Chinese Government appears to be regaining a certain
                        amount of influence in Sinkiang, the Chinese-Soviet relationship in Sinkiang
                        remains a delicate one.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that temporary assignments, which might be more accurately
                        described as in the nature of occasional visits or trips, would appear to
                        offer a more satisfactory means of observing and reporting on conditions in
                        central Asian areas. It is believed that temporary visits could be made to
                        certain of these areas without raising troublesome and complex issues of
                        sovereignty. It seems likely that the granting of permission for temporary
                        visits, at least to certain areas of Tibet and Sinkiang, could be arranged
                        on short notice and on an informal basis. It seems likely, too, that
                        temporary visits of American representatives to central Asian areas would
                        occasion much less speculation in various official quarters as to American
                        motives than would be raised by American endeavors to seek permanent <pb
                            n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0701"/>representation. Temporary
                        assignments or visits would result in economies of staff and expenses. The
                        policy of excluding third-power nationals, apparently followed in the past
                        by the Soviet and Mongolian authorities, renders it highly unlikely that
                        American observers will be permitted to visit Outer Mongolia in any
                        capacity.</p>
                    <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">The areas within which representation might be
                            established</hi>. Areas in central Asia within which American
                        representation might be sought comprise Tibet, Sinkiang and Outer Mongolia.
                        Each of these areas is discussed below in the light of its availability as
                        an area in which American representation might be established:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Tibet</hi>. Under existing conditions there appears to be
                        little reason for the permanent stationing of American representatives in
                        Tibet. Rather than endeavor to establish permanent American representation
                        in Tibet at this time, it would perhaps be preferable to explore the
                        possibility of sending American representatives from time to time on
                        observation trips into Tibet. Representatives sent from India would probably
                        be in the best position to obtain permission to travel in Tibet and they
                        would be most accessible to Lhasa, capital and heart of the country. Travel
                        from Chungking or Kunming into Tibet would involve formidable difficulties
                        and would probably not be warranted under existing conditions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Sinkiang</hi>. With the loss of the Burma Road, Sinkiang
                        has assumed increasing importance as a route for the shipment of supplies to
                        and from China. Sinkiang is also a key to the future development of
                        Chinese-Soviet relations. For these reasons it may be desirable to consider
                        the establishment of American representation in Sinkiang. Such
                        representation, it is believed, might be either permanent or temporary. If
                        it is deemed desirable to establish permanent representation, it might be
                        located at Tihwa (Urumchi) or at Kashgar. Of these two cities it would seem
                        that Tihwa, the capital and center of Soviet influence, would offer the best
                        opportunities for political observation, particularly with reference to
                        Soviet activities. Tihwa is an important junction on a highway between Alma
                        Ata and Lanchow and is also a stopping point on the China-Russia air route.
                        At present Kashgar would appear to possess only secondary importance from
                        the point of view of the establishment of American representation. It is
                        probable that it is too remote from Tihwa to be of much value in reporting
                        developments taking place in Tihwa, and at present it is not an important
                        center for the transshipment of supplies to and from China, although it may
                        assume growing importance in this respect.</p>
                    <p>Endeavors to station an American representative at Tihwa in a permanent
                        capacity at this time would, in view of the peculiar political conditions
                        that obtain in Sinkiang, likely meet with Chinese objections <pb n="692"
                            xml:id="pg_692" facs="0702"/>and perhaps with outright refusal. In all
                        probability a proposal to establish permanent American representation at
                        Kashgar would be more favorably received by the Chinese authorities, since
                        both the British and the Russians appear to have consular representatives in
                        that city.</p>
                    <p>Having in mind the potential importance of Sinkiang, it would appear that the
                        periodic detail of an American representative to travel in the province
                        would be adequate to supply the American Government with independent,
                        factual information in regard thereto. In all probability a request made to
                        the appropriate authorities for the travel of American representatives in
                        Sinkiang would meet a far more favorable reception than would a request for
                        permanent representation. The Embassy at Chungking would appear to be in the
                        best position to detail a representative to travel in Sinkiang; or in the
                        event that an officer is to be stationed at Lanchow, he might be available
                        for periodic trips to Hami, Tihwa and other cities in Sinkiang.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Outer Mongolia</hi>. Although the paucity of authentic
                        information at present available to this Government in regard to Outer
                        Mongolia and Manchuria and the possibility of a Russo-Japanese military
                        conflict in the Far East point to the desirability of stationing American
                        representatives in Outer Mongolia, it is believed that endeavors to post
                        representatives in this area, either in a permanent or a temporary capacity,
                        are likely to fail, it apparently having been the standing policy of the
                        Soviet and the Mongol authorities to exclude third-power nationals,
                        including officials, from Outer Mongolia. In view of this attitude on the
                        part of the Russian and Mongolian authorities, it is highly questionable
                        whether it would be advisable that an endeavor should be made to send an
                        American representative to Outer Mongolia. Should it prove feasible on
                        investigation to send an American representative to Outer Mongolia, it is
                        believed that he could best be detailed to proceed from Moscow or
                        Vladivostok, and that he should endeavor to proceed to Ulan Bator, the seat
                        of governing authority. Here again a request for travel in Outer Mongolia
                        would in all probability be more favorably received than would a request for
                        permanent representation.</p>
                    <p>Since travel through Russia would seem to be necessary to reach Ulan Bator,
                        presumably Russian permission would be needed before an American
                        representative could proceed to Outer Mongolia.</p>

                    <p>1252. Reference my 1168, October 12, 1 p.m. and Department’s 981, October 23,
                        8 p.m. regarding additional consular offices in China. I called on Political
                        Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday morning and requested further
                        consideration of the matter along lines of telegrams under reference. During
                        a courtesy call on Foreign Minister Soong, I mentioned that I was proceeding
                        thence to see Vice Minister on a pending matter. He expressed interest and
                        asked me to outline the matter which I did.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday afternoon Vice Minister telephoned to me that Minister Soong agrees
                        to our sending Embassy officers to Chengtu, Sian and Lanchow and asked that
                        Counselor of Embassy attend at the Foreign Office to receive an oral
                        statement on subject from Dr. Chang, Director of American Department who
                        informed Vincent as follows.</p>
                    <p>After reviewing position with regard to Lanchow and Kweilin, Chang stated
                        that he was instructed by Foreign Minister to say that it would be agreeable
                        to Chinese Government if American Government stationed at Sian and Chengtu
                        “officers pertaining to personnel <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0704"
                        />of Embassy to take care of American nationals in those localities during
                        present war.”</p>
                    <p>He then said that “Inasmuch as the Northwest is becoming increasingly
                        important on account of the prospective development of communication,
                        perhaps the American Government may find it practicable to have a consular
                        officer stationed at Tihua for the duration of the war. If so, it would be
                        agreeable to the Chinese Government.”</p>
                    <p>In our conversations with the Foreign Office on the subject of consular
                        offices, we have never mentioned Tihua but the Department may wish to accept
                        the offer of the Chinese Government which is no doubt prompted by recent
                        developments in Sinkiang. The Russians have a consular office in Tihua and
                        the Chinese probably feel that the presence of an American Consular Officer
                        there would be good political strategy. Our immediate interest there now
                        would be in observing development of transport by the northwest route.</p>
                    <p>With regard to representation at Lanchow, Sian and Chengtu, I feel that it
                        would be advisable to accept the proposal as a temporary arrangement with
                        the idea of deferring definitive plans for representation in those cities
                        until the conclusion of the new treaty and until time has given an
                        indication of just what type of representation will prove most
                        effective.</p>
                    <p>The members of the Embassy staff detailed to serve in those centers might
                        also be appointed as Consuls at Kunming which would enable them perform
                        certain essential consular functions. The “consular officer” at Tihua if
                        appointed might also serve in a dual capacity inasmuch as the Chinese
                        Government appears to desire that we have simply a representative there
                        rather than a Consulate.</p>
                    <p>With regard to Kweilin, the Embassy suggests that the consular office there
                        be placed under the supervision of Kunming and that Kunming office might be
                        raised to a Consulate General in charge of an officer of suitable rank and
                        experience.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Government now maintains “delegates for foreign affairs” at
                        Kunming, Kweilin and Lanchow. I mentioned yesterday to Foreign Minister and
                        Vice Minister matter of possible extension of this system. Vice Minister in
                        afternoon told Vincent that he had discussed matter with Dr. Soong; that

                            printed.</note> In view of the longstanding need of the Department and
                        of other agencies of the Government for an expansion of the economic and
                        commercial informational service from Chungking and in the light of the
                        present increasing demand on the Department by other agencies of the
                        Government for specialized information within the economic warfare as well
                        as the general economic field, the Department believes that it is necessary
                        that the Embassy be augmented by an adequately staffed Commercial Attaché’s
                        office if the Foreign Service in China is to fulfill one of its important
                        functions. The Department realizes, of course, that quarters are cramped and
                        facilities in general are meager at Chungking. <pb n="696" xml:id="pg_696"
                            facs="0706"/>We believe, however, that the interests of the Government
                        will be better served by a Commercial Attaché’s office than by an expansion
                        of field personnel representing other Government agencies and operating
                        without the coordinating and other benefits of a single unit within the
                        Embassy. The situation to be met is such, in the Department’s opinion, that
                        the Commercial Attaché should proceed to establish his office as soon as
                        practicable. If necessary he might utilize office and residential quarters
                        on the city side of the river.</p>
                    <p>While it would, of course, be preferable that the Commercial Attaché have a
                        working knowledge of the Chinese language, there are not any China language
                        officers available for this duty. It is believed that Mr. Richards<note
                            n="8" xml:id="d607fn8">J. Bartlett Richards.</note> will not greatly
                        feel the lack of a knowledge of the Chinese language in his contacts with
                        important officials at Chungking, many of whom are understood to speak
                        English; that he will be able to get along with an interpreter in such
                        travel as he may undertake; and that his economic reporting experience,
                        together with a fresh point of view, makes him a suitable choice for the
                        assignment.</p>
                    <p>We should appreciate your recommendations as to personnel and office
                        equipment for the office of the Commercial Attaché. It is our thought that
                        in addition to an Assistant Commercial Attaché (who is expected to be
                        designated shortly) the office will probably require an American
                        clerk-stenographer, a Chinese interpreter-translator, two or three typists
                        and perhaps messengers. It is expected that it will be practicable to
                        arrange for the personnel proceeding from Washington to take with them
                        portable typewriters.</p>

                    <p>55. During the past year the Department has given increasing attention to the
                        desirability of supplementing the aid which this Government has been
                        extending to China, along the lines of what may be conveniently termed
                        cultural assistance, designed, during the emergency, primarily to bolster
                        Chinese morale and secondarily to assist China in many different ways in
                        which American scientific technical, social, educational, industrial and
                        other experience may be of use to China in raising its standard of living,
                        improving the condition of its rural population, assisting in the
                        development of educational, social and administrative programs and thus
                        contributing to China’s war effort. A modest initial allocation of $150,000
                        from emergency funds has just been made for this purpose available until the
                        end of the present fiscal year. Since these funds have been provided on an
                        elastic basis the emphasis can be changed as circumstances may require. In
                        view of the new developments during December, the Department intends to
                        emphasize especially those aspects of its program which will be of the most
                        immediate benefit to China, in strengthening civilian morale and in pursuit
                        of the aims outlined above. The following items have received the
                        Department’s approval.</p>
                    <p>Item 1. Exchange of technical and cultural leaders, $80,000. It is intended
                        to send to China as soon as possible a number of American scholars and
                        others who will also be primarily specialists in various fields of study and
                        activity of essential importance to China, in order to: familiarize
                        themselves with problems in China relating to their field of study; discuss
                        these problems with officials and scholars there; give advice, if desired,
                        regarding short and long term assistance in these fields; submit an
                        exhaustive report of their findings upon their return, together with
                        recommendations; and be available to the Department for consultation for a
                        reasonable period <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0708"/>thereafter. Among
                        the specialties which persons selected for these missions should possess
                        would be: (1) Medical science, including hospital administration, drugs,
                        emergency assistance to the wounded, control of epidemics, etcetera. (2)
                        Public Health. To give advice and assistance as requested regarding general
                        problems of health in China, both urban and rural, especially in matters of
                        preventive medicine, epidemic control, maternity and child welfare,
                        nutrition and social hygiene. (3) Vocational instruction. The persons
                        selected should be competent to give advice regarding this important phase
                        of education; confer on this subject with interested officials and other
                        Chinese; determine how the visual and other aids for vocational instruction
                        prepared by this Government, as well as the experience of our public schools
                        might best be adapted to the needs of the Chinese. (4) Agriculture. Persons
                        sent should visit agricultural schools in free China, discuss with faculty
                        members and Government officials the best means for the United States to
                        assist China to raise the standard of its rural population, both in
                        agriculture and in the field of health, as well as to ascertain how the
                        extensive material in motion picture and pamphlet form prepared by this
                        Government could best be utilized for the assistance of the Chinese farmer.
                        (5) A librarian should be sent to confer with directors of university and
                        other libraries in China to give such advice as may be desired and to
                        ascertain what books, and in what order of priority, are must urgently
                        needed, as well as to report to the Department regarding the relative merits
                        of several different methods of making such books available to the Chinese,
                        including microfilm, offset printing, etcetera. (6) Physics. To advise in
                        connection with the general university discipline, as well as regarding the
                        war time needs of China, and to survey the urgent requirements of the
                        Chinese refugee universities for scientific apparatus. (7) Chemistry. In
                        general the same as Physics. (8) Engineering. To include hydraulic,
                        industrial and communications engineers as well as an engineer competent to
                        give advice concerning administrative and curricular problems of
                        undergraduate engineering instruction. The engineers should be prepared to
                        advise government and university officials as requested and to ascertain the
                        engineering needs of China as well as to determine how best those needs
                        might be served by the United States. (9) A mining engineer should likewise
                        survey the mining field, act as consultant if desired by the Chinese
                        Government, confer with university engineering faculties and report China’s
                        most urgent mining needs. (10) Paper industry. In view of the acute shortage
                        of paper in free China, a specialist in the paper industry might be of
                        assistance to the Chinese Government in giving advice as to the best way of
                        expanding China’s <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0709"/>production of
                        paper. (11) Regional Planning. To explore with Chinese officials and others
                        the feasibility of setting up a plan for the eventual development of certain
                        areas in China on an integrated regional basis, similar in general to that
                        employed by the Tennessee Valley Authority. (12) In addition, persons
                        competent to make to the Chinese Government suggestions in the fields of
                        public administration, fiscal policy, social security and rural credit might
                        also be sent if requested. The sending of not to exceed ten persons in such
                        fields as those indicated above is contemplated during the present fiscal
                        year. Should transportation facilities improve, it is also desired to invite
                        a few outstanding Chinese to lecture widely in this country for the purpose
                        of acquainting Americans with Chinese customs, institutions and
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>Item 2. Aid to certain Chinese students pursuing technical, administrative
                        and educational studies in the United States, $20,000.</p>
                    <p>Item 3. The development of a series of radio programs in Mandarin and the
                        principal dialects designed to acquaint the Chinese with the broad aspects
                        of our culture, institutions, and defense effort, $5,000. These programs
                        would be of an educational nature and, being worked out in close cooperation
                        with the Coordinator of Information, would of course in no wise compete with
                        the latter’s essentially news function. Two methods of utilization of these
                        programs are envisaged: (1) Direct short-wave broadcasting to Chungking for
                        possible retransmission by medium and long wave to provincial towns and
                        cities, and (2) the use of transcriptions of such broadcasts to be shipped
                        to China for local rebroadcast by medium and long wave.</p>
                    <p>Item 4. Motion pictures, $15,000. The sending to China of two light trucks
                        together with projection equipment for each, in order to display in
                        provincial and rural areas in China a series of motion pictures designed:
                        (1) to acquaint Chinese of all classes with various aspects of American
                        life, institutions and war effort and (2) to display, wherever they can be
                        useful, many government films dealing with modern agricultural methods,
                        animal husbandry, hygiene, sanitation, child welfare, maternity, soil and
                        flood control, forestation, et cetera.</p>
                    <p>Item 5. The donation to refugee universities of urgently needed textbooks,
                        microscopes and other scientific equipment, $20,000.</p>
                    <p>The Department has been giving careful consideration for some time to the
                        various items of this program, and now that funds for its initiation have
                        become available, desires to have your frank and considered views regarding
                        its probable effectiveness, your recommendations regarding the individual
                        items thereof, as well as your opinion as to where major emphasis should be
                        placed. Your suggestions as well as those of others whom you may desire to
                        consult in this connection, <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0710"
                        />regarding persons whom you would especially recommend to be sent to China
                        in the capacities suggested in item 1 above, would be welcomed.</p>
                    <p>In your discretion and unless you have specific criticism or suggestions to
                        offer regarding any of the items above set forth, you may discuss this
                        program with officials of the Chinese Government and, after pointing out
                        that this Government views cultural relations as essentially a two-way
                        process and would welcome reciprocal cultural activities in this country by
                        the Chinese Government, inquire: (1) whether it would desire to see such a
                        program inaugurated, and (2) would be prepared to give full facilities to
                        persons sent to China for its execution. It would be particularly helpful to
                        learn which type of the specialists whom it is intended to send to China
                        would in your opinion and in that of the Chinese Government be the ones most
                        urgently needed.</p>

                    <p>113. Reference Department’s No. 55, January 29, 9 p.m. The Embassy has given
                        careful study to the program outlined in the Department’s telegram and deems
                        desirable before discussing it with the Chinese Government to submit the
                        following comments for the Department’s consideration:</p>
                    <p>Having in mind Chinese sensibilities, it is desirable to avoid any suggestion
                        now of “cultural” missions to China. The proposed program would do little
                        toward bolstering morale and the least said publicly in that direction at
                        the present time the better. Our program should be fashioned as an effort to
                        contribute toward maintaining China’s educational front during the war
                        period, and should be calculated to ensure as beneficial results as possible
                        under existing difficult conditions. Any extensive surveys should be left to
                        the postwar period or at least until the approach of peace.</p>
                    <p>With regard to item 1 of the program, it is the Embassy’s view, supported by
                        informed American and Chinese opinion, that there is no substantial benefit
                        to be derived from the proposed technical or expert surveys and reports to
                        be made by American specialists. Such surveys could readily be made by fully
                        qualified Chinese specialists and experts, and also, in many lines, by
                        American specialists connected with American mission universities which have
                        for years been doing <pb n="701" xml:id="pg_701" facs="0711"/>work along the
                        lines envisaged in the program. The needs in China at present are
                        sufficiently well known; the primary concern is how to meet those needs so
                        far as possible in the face of the limitations on financial support, of
                        inflation, and of the quite apparent impossibility because of transportation
                        difficulties of receiving material assistance from abroad.</p>
                    <p>It should be borne in mind that the Burma Road is seriously threatened and in
                        any case must be reserved almost entirely for military purposes.
                        Communication with and within China is now largely restricted to air
                        transport; these facilities are extremely limited and expensive; and there
                        is no present prospect of any early improvement in the transport
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>Most programs and projects in all lines necessitating the importation of
                        equipment or extensive financing are being postponed but it is probable that
                        in such fields as medical science, public health and agriculture China may
                        have immediate need for experts or specialists not for short time surveys
                        but for constructive collaboration over longer periods. I recommend that in
                        lieu of the program proposed under item 1 we invite the Chinese Government
                        to inform us of any immediate need for specialists or experts in particular
                        lines and that we then undertake if possible to supply and finance them.</p>
                    <p>As transportation facilities improve we might offer to send qualified leaders
                        in our educational field to lecture at the various universities,
                        particularly on subjects where China [during?] the isolation of the war
                        period may not have been able to keep abreast of outside programs and
                        developments. At the same time it would be desirable to make available to
                        Chinese professors fellowships in the United States for refresher courses
                        and pharmacy study and research.</p>
                    <p>Item 2 of the Department program is undoubtedly desirable. As to items 3 and
                        4 it is suggested (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that broadcasts could be most
                        effectively handled in Chungking from materials supplied from the United
                        States in collaboration with the Coordinator of Information and his staff
                        attached to this Embassy and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) that inasmuch as it
                        is impracticable to send and operate sound trucks at this time it would be
                        desirable to send 16 mm. movie projectors equipped for silent films of the
                        kind described for loan to Chinese institutions and existing “screen
                        centers.” A more detailed report in regard to such activities will be
                        submitted later.</p>
                    <p>Regarding item 5 the contemplated donations would fill an urgent need but the
                        problem of transportation is here again involved. Microfilms of current
                        scientific and engine publications for use in the universities to enable
                        faculty members to keep abreast of progress and developments abroad would be
                        most helpful.</p>
                    <pb n="702" xml:id="pg_702" facs="0712"/>
                    <p>My observations since my arrival here lead me to submit for consideration a
                        belated [suggestion?] which has met cordial approval amongst informed
                        Americans and Chinese confidentially consulted; a suggestion calculated to
                        bolster morale amongst a class of Chinese whose influence in the present and
                        for the future is important both to China and the United States; a proposal
                        which would contribute substantially toward maintaining China’s educational
                        front during the war. I suggest grants in aid to the faculties of the
                        universities and perhaps traveling colleges in free China—government and
                        private, including American missionary—such grants to be controlled by
                        faculty committees for the purpose of alleviating individual cases of
                        distress and hardship amongst Chinese members of the teaching profession and
                        their families, and, if funds permit, in special cases, amongst particularly
                        promising students.</p>
                    <p>China in a wise effort to maintain her educational front has removed
                        universities with their faculties and student bodies into Free China and the
                        Government educational budget has been increased to [apparent omission]
                        times that of prewar years but in the face of inflation with living costs
                        and commodity prices 15 to 18 times prewar levels the educational financial
                        position is straitened. The teaching profession is admittedly the most
                        seriously affected of all classes in China with the result that many
                        members, including highly educated specialists and experts unable longer to
                        support themselves and their families, are abandoning the profession and
                        obtaining other employment. This situation is reportedly serious. It is
                        important to China to retain these men in their profession. Grants in aid
                        which would permit faculty committees to provide medical and other aid
                        during illness or [aid?] providing for tuition of children, et cetera, would
                        be a real assistance to this important and influencial Chinese class. If
                        this suggestion is favorably received by the Department, I shall be glad to
                        study and develop the proposal further. I believe that two or three hundred
                        dollars United States currency would be well spent in such grants in aid to
                        university faculties and promising students. It has also been suggested that
                        grants in aid might be made to a limited number of outstanding scholars to
                        permit them to pursue research work now abandoned either because of lack of
                        equipment or because of the necessity of seeking outside employment to eke
                        out university [salaries?].</p>
                    <p>The Embassy is continuing to study and will report further in regard to
                        specific phases of the Department program and meanwhile would appreciate
                        being informed of the Department’s reaction to the crews [<hi rend="italic"

                        having your detailed and constructive comment regarding its program of
                        assistance to China. It fully shares your view that under present
                        circumstances the purpose of strengthening China’s morale, which need not be
                        mentioned in your conversations, is best achieved by the indirect method of
                        assisting China in the most practical fashion during the present
                        emergency.</p>
                    <p>With regard to item 1 of the program you are authorized to invite the Chinese
                        Government to inform you at once of any immediate needs which it has for
                        specialists or experts in particular fields. To the extent that the
                        Department is able to finance and send such specialists to China, it would
                        naturally utilize the experience of persons, both Chinese and American, who
                        have long been doing work in China in the various segments of their field of
                        specialization. Under present conditions, the Department feels that in order
                        to be of maximum utility to the Chinese Government, as well as in the
                        interest of transportation economy, the persons sent should remain for at
                        least one year.</p>
                    <p>The Department has already exchanged views on the needs of China in medical
                        science and public health, in so far as these are ascertainable here, with
                        medical groups in this country active in China. It is likewise discussing
                        the question of agricultural assistance with the Department of Agriculture,
                        and would welcome any further views which you may have regarding the urgent
                        needs of China in the above fields.</p>
                    <p>You are also authorized to discuss with the Chinese Government the general
                        scope of activities contemplated in the Department’s initial telegram to you
                        on this subject, bearing in mind the foregoing observations.</p>
                    <p>The Department desires you to report as soon as feasible your fuller
                        recommendations on the radio and motion picture items of the program. Any
                        information as to radio and motion picture facilities available in Chunking,
                        and elsewhere in China where they might be useful, would be especially
                        helpful. How effective a radio audience do you believe it would be feasible
                        to reach by radio broadcasts of the nature contemplated? The Department
                        proposes to send 16 millimeter motion picture projectors to the Embassy as
                        soon as practicable. It hopes however to send sound equipment, which is also
                        utilizable for silent films, since such equipment will be later useful for
                        the <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0714"/>showing of sound pictures.
                        Generators will likewise be shipped if possible.</p>
                    <p>The Department would be glad also to have your suggestions on the
                        following:</p>
                    <p>Are adequate books in Chinese on American history, democratic thought and
                        biography available in Chungking and the outlying university centers? What
                        would be your estimate of the effectiveness in this general direction of a
                        Chinese edition of the <hi rend="italic">Reader’s Digest</hi>, should means
                        be found to have one issued?</p>
                    <p>With regard to your comments on item 5 of the program, the Department
                        understands that the Office of the Coordinator of Information is at present
                        conferring with the Library of Congress concerning the possibility of
                        supplying microfilms of current learned journals, especially scientific
                        ones.</p>
                    <p>Careful study will be given to your recommendation regarding grants in aid to
                        faculties and universities in Free China. Without raising any expectations
                        in this respect that funds will be available for this purpose, can you
                        estimate approximately the number of persons who should be thus aided, as
                        well as the amount of money which would effectively care for this need?</p>

                        Government regarding needs for specialists. In its discussion with officials
                        Embassy finds that health, agricultural and engineering experts are in most
                        demand but it must await meeting of the Executive Yuan next Tuesday for

                    <p>Mr. Acheson stated that Mr. Welles<note n="8" xml:id="d612fn8">Sumner Welles,
                            Under Secretary of State.</note> had asked that the question of the
                        possibility of sending an Economic Mission to China, a subject which has
                        been under consideration at various times in the past, should be
                        reconsidered at this time.</p>
                    <p>In the ensuing discussion on this subject there was general agreement that
                        there is no reason for this Government to consider at this time sending a
                        formal Economic Mission to China.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Finletter said that from point of view of obtaining strategic materials
                        from China there was no need in his judgment, as the situation now stands,
                        to send any expert to China. It was agreed, however, that it would be useful
                        for the RFC<note n="9" xml:id="d612fn9">Reconstruction Finance
                            Corporation.</note> to send a representative to India who would devote
                        special attention to problems relating to transportation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Fox expressed the view that we should be very careful of Chinese
                        susceptibilities and that it was definitely desirable that this Government
                        act only in case the Chinese Government should take some initiative or
                        otherwise show that it desired to receive experts. Mr. Currie expressed
                        concurrence in the viewpoint advanced by Mr. Fox.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hamilton said that it was the view of the Far Eastern Division that were
                        we at this time to propose to the Chinese Government that we send an
                        Economic Mission, the Chinese might regard it as an attempt on our part to
                        supervise expenditure of the proceeds of the recent $500,000,000 loan.<note
                            n="10" xml:id="d612fn10">For correspondence on this subject, see <ref
                                target="#pg_419">pp. 419</ref> ff.</note> Both Mr. Fox and Mr.
                        Currie agreed with this view and felt in general that China’s need at the
                        present time is for individual technical specialists rather than for any
                        general Economic Mission. Mr. Fox in particular said that he felt that
                        foreign <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0716"/>advisory missions are
                        rather in disrepute in China at the present time.</p>
                    <p>There was general agreement that the Department should continue with the
                        approaches which it has already made through Ambassador Gauss to obtain from
                        the Chinese Government indication of particular specialists which China
                        needs at present. In this connection reference was made to the Department’s
                        telegram on this subject of February 24 to Chungking, No. 130, and of Mr.
                        Gauss’ reply of March 15, No. 226. In this latter telegram Mr. Gauss said
                        that from preliminary discussions which he had had with Chinese officials he
                        gathered that health, agriculture and engineering are the three principal
                        fields in which China would welcome the assistance of individual specialists
                        sent out by the United States, but that he hoped shortly after the next
                        meeting of the Executive Yuan (which was scheduled for March 17 or perhaps
                        March 24) to receive detailed information as to the wishes of the Chinese
                        Government in this matter.</p>
                    <p>It was generally agreed that we should await a further communication on this
                        subject from Mr. Gauss. Mr. Grummon explained that the Division of Cultural
                        Relations has already established good contacts with the various medical
                        groups in this country who are interested in assisting China. He said that
                        Mr. Roger Greene<note n="11" xml:id="d612fn11">Consultant, Division of
                            Cultural Relations.</note> is undertaking a survey of the activities in
                        China of these groups and is attempting to ascertain what fields of medicine
                        are at present inadequately covered by these activities. Mr. Grummon also
                        referred to conferences which the Division of Cultural Relations has had
                        with the Department of Agriculture and reported that the Department of
                        Agriculture is prepared to supply several experts if the Chinese Government
                        desires their services. In this connection Mr. Hamilton remarked that as a
                        result of a request from the Chinese Government the Department of
                        Agriculture has already agreed to make available to China the services of
                        Dr. Lowdermilk as soon as Dr. Lowdermilk has recovered from a current
                        illness. Dr. Lowdermilk is a specialist in the field of soil
                        conservation.</p>

                    <p>246. Reference your telegram No. 280, March 27, 9 a.m. Department is
                        proceeding with arrangements for selecting the ten specialists desired by
                        the Chinese Government to the end that they may leave for China as soon as
                        feasible. The amount available in the current fiscal year for the purpose of
                        affording technical assistance to China (including salaries, transportation
                        to China and return, and per diem en route) was originally considered
                        sufficient for 20 persons, but increased transportation costs have
                        necessitated reduction to 10. In <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0718"
                        />this connection Department would appreciate having your opinion as to
                        whether it would be advisable for us to approach the Chinese Government with
                        the suggestion that necessary quarters and transportation in China be
                        furnished gratis by the Chinese Government to these specialists and to any
                        others who may be sent to China under similar circumstances.</p>
                    <p>A preliminary estimate of about 30 specialists to be sent to China during the
                        1943 fiscal year was submitted by the Department last November to the Bureau
                        of the Budget. In connection with forthcoming budget hearings the Department
                        would be glad to receive from you as early as possible your own estimate
                        (necessarily tentative) of the number and types of specialists who, under
                        foreseeable circumstances, could be of greatest utility to China during the
                        1943 fiscal year.</p>
                    <p>The Department would appreciate more precise information regarding the type
                        of mechanical engineer referred to in numbered paragraph 4 of your reference
                        telegram.</p>
                    <p>Department understands that Major Pyle, army veterinarian, and one assistant
                        have been sent to China by the Army under lend-lease and are due to arrive
                        shortly in Chungking. As it is understood that these men have been sent to
                        perform special duties in China, the Department assumes that they are to be
                        considered as in addition to the 10 specialists now desired by the Chinese
                        Government.</p>

                    <p>267. The Department has given some thought to the desirability of extending
                        financial assistance to the Chinese American Institute of Cultural Relations
                        at Chungking and to other pro-American groups in China such as returned
                        students’ organizations. Our government has already extended assistance of
                        this nature to many such groups in Latin America, the highest single grant
                        so far to any one institution amounting to $20,000.</p>
                    <p>In view of the similarity of the announced objectives of the Chinese American
                        Institute to those approved by the Department in connection with its program
                        of cultural relations with China the question arises whether financial
                        assistance extended to the Institute and/or other similar groups in China
                        would contribute to making them more active agencies in promoting
                        Sino-American friendship and interest in American thought and activities
                        among the important university-trained <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709"
                            facs="0719"/>groups in Chungking. The Department would be glad to have
                        your considered views on this subject as well as recommendations as to the
                        amount which could usefully be given.</p>
                    <p>The Institute referred to is understood to be occupying at present three
                        rooms in Chungking which have been lent to it by the New Life Movement. It
                        is further understood to have made the start of assembling a small library
                        and to be in a position to show motion pictures sent by this country. Should
                        you feel that financial assistance to this group would be helpful it is
                        suggested that in making your recommendations to the Department regarding
                        this matter you consider whether, if funds are granted, it would be feasible
                        and desirable to suggest that they be expended for more appropriate
                        quarters, for the acquisition of furniture and for support to branch
                        organizations in important cities in China.</p>
                    <p>The Department plans to send shortly to the Embassy for transmission, at your
                        discretion, to the Institute, subscriptions to certain American periodicals
                        and a number of books in English dealing with United States history,
                        thought, and biography.</p>

                    <p>403. Your 267, April 9, 4 p.m. The Chinese American Institute of Cultural
                        Relations was formed several years ago when other similar Sino-foreign
                        societies were being organized. It has existed under the presidency and
                        domination [of?] Dr. H. H. Kung, Minister of Finance, its activities being
                        limited principally to social functions on anniversaries and special
                        occasions which have been indicated as representing the personal hospitality
                        of Kung. There is reason to believe that all these similar Sino-foreign
                        [groups?] receive some limited support from the government or the party.
                        They must all be registered with the Ministry of Social Welfare which in the
                        case of this institute and perhaps some of the others, sought to stipulate
                        that the constitution should carry a political requirement that no one shall
                        be a member who opposes the principles of the San Min Chu I<note n="13"

                    <p>Efforts have recently been begun to reorganize the institute; a new
                        constitution is being drafted which will quietly omit the political
                        requirement above mentioned; and plans have been made to expand the
                        activities of the institute, to provide reading rooms and library, sponsor
                        lectures, solicit scholarships for Chinese in the United States, et cetera.
                        The reorganization would not eliminate Dr. Kung in any way as the dominant
                        influence but would seek to make the institute less a personal affair and
                        more generally effective. The institute at present has not [<hi
                            rend="italic">no</hi>] reading rooms or library. If the plans are
                        successfully carried out, I believe the organization may properly be the
                        object of recognition in our cultural relations program, probably by way of
                        a contribution toward rental of reading rooms, purchase of furniture and
                        furnishings, and books and periodicals from the United States when it
                        becomes practicable actually to get them in to aid Chungking. In this
                        connection it should be remembered that rentals and costs of furniture, et
                        cetera, at Chungking are extortionately high and also that everything
                        provided may at any time be destroyed during bombing raids.</p>
                    <p>It might be helpful in encouraging the recognition of the institute on a more
                        satisfactory basis if we were to know that a sum, say 5000 United States
                        dollars, might be available as a contribution toward renting and furnishing
                        suitable reading rooms.</p>
                    <p>I am not prepared at this time to recommend that any support be given to
                        proposals to entrust the institute with the awarding of scholarships or
                        fellowships in the United States.</p>

                        <item>The Embassy feels that the Chinese Government should furnish quarters
                            and transportation in China to the experts. The matter has been brought
                            informally to the attention of the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs who
                            indicated concurrence and undertook to give the Embassy a definite reply
                            later. It was not considered advisable to make a point of whether such
                            accommodations should be furnished gratis, but it is my opinion that
                            such will be the case.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The Vice Minister has orally inquired when the various experts
                            requested may be expected to arrive in China.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>It should be pointed out that living costs, food and clothing in
                            particular, are extremely high here and are rising; that the experts <pb
                                n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0721"/>should receive a substantial
                            per diem; and that they should arrange such allotments of salary as may
                            be desired before leaving America.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>The Embassy does not consider that more than 20 experts in addition to
                            the 10 already requested could be effectively employed in China in
                            present circumstances. There is no doubt that a great many medical
                            doctors, educators, and technical experts are needed in China, but the
                            Embassy believes that the scale and objective of the Department’s
                            program do not envisage so general an approach to the problem. The
                            Chinese Government is now giving consideration to the matter on the
                            basis of a possible 20 additional experts. While the Embassy has
                            endeavored and will continue to endeavor to influence the choice of
                            experts at lines which it considers in keeping with Department’s
                            program, it is convinced that any experts sent out should be sent in
                            response to requests from the Chinese Government. A tentative suggestion
                            in regard to the general character of additional experts would include 2
                            or more public health experts; several medical doctors; 1 or more
                            nutrition specialists; a number of agricultural experts familiar with
                            experimental farming practice, farming marketing cooperative
                            organizations, et cetera; a number of economics teachers with modern
                            outlook; and such technicians, engineers, et cetera, as the Chinese
                            Government might reasonably require.</item>

                            State. On April 9, 1942, Your Excellency verbally informed Vice Minister
                                Fu<note n="17" xml:id="d618fn17">Foo Ping-sheung.</note> of this
                            Ministry that during the next fiscal year (beginning July 1, 1942), the
                            American Government had decided to send in addition not more than twenty
                            experts to China for service, making a total of thirty including the ten
                            previously decided upon.</p>
                        <p>In compliance with Your Excellency’s request, I have the honor to enclose
                            a second list of fifteen experts whose services are needed by the
                            Chinese Government departments concerned. In the first list of experts,
                            there were included a corn and potato breeder and an insecticide and
                            fungicide expert for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The
                            Ministry has explained that, in regard to the corn and potato breeder
                            whom it needs, it makes no difference whether he <pb n="713"
                                xml:id="pg_713" facs="0723"/>is major in one and minor in the other,
                            although it is preferred that he be specialized in both. As regards the
                            insecticide and fungicide expert, he should be well versed in chemistry
                            and in the manufacture of insecticides and fungicides. It would be much
                            better if he also knows insect and plant pathology. But he should have
                            experience in the operation of a small-scale insecticide and fungicide
                            laboratory in order that the laboratory may immediately start work upon
                            his arrival. The Ministry earnestly hopes that these experts have wide
                            knowledge and experience and have an appropriate rank (in their
                            respective lines of studies). The Ministry proposes to fix their term of
                            office at three or four years.</p>

                    <p>Some caution has been exercised in initiating cultural relations activities
                        in China because of one basic contrast to the Latin American program. Latin
                        American culture is an offshoot of European culture and is therefore
                        understood with relative ease by North Americans who have studied that area.
                        Chinese culture, on the other hand, <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0725"
                        />is native to Asia and in many respects bears no similarity to
                        European-American culture.</p>

                    <p>About the first of April, the Ambassador cabled a list of ten types of

                    <p>The Department, after consulting with other Departments of this Government,
                        sent numerous telegrams to China to clarify the type of experience desired
                        in the experts, their prospective duties, and the materials with which they
                        would work.</p>
                    <p>Approximately 175 candidates have been asked to submit their professional
                        records, and nearly 100 have been interviewed. One man (a corn and potato
                        breeder) has been selected. For the others the field of choice has been
                        narrowed to one or two candidates.</p>
                    <p>A sum of $100,000 has been reserved in the 1942 budget for the expenses of
                        these experts. They will fly to China during the present summer.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">II <hi rend="italic">Student Training</hi>.</p>
                    <p>A two-man committee was appointed by the Department to recommend the names of
                        Chinese students who were most deserving of assistance. The $20,000
                        available for student work was distributed to 91 students at the rate of
                        $75.00 per month for the three months of April, May, and June.</p>
                    <p>The need among Chinese students continued to be great. The President received
                        a number of letters from prominent citizens urging the Government to provide
                        further aid for the Chinese in our universities. A total of 987 Chinese
                        students were in this country when the war began and unable to return home.
                        With the consent of Assistant Secretary Shaw the Department allocated an
                        additional $15,000 in its cultural relations program to student assistance.
                        This provided monthly assistance of $75.00 to an additional sixty-six
                        students. The Department thus aided 157 students during part of the 1942
                        fiscal year.</p>
                    <p>Two Chinese engineering students were sent at Government expense to Madison,
                        Wisconsin to work on a new charcoal burning engine for China.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Funds appropriated for printed materials have been directed almost entirely
                        toward microfilming, which can reproduce a 300-page book on two ounces of
                        film. The Chinese can use this film in several ways: they can read directly
                        from the film, they can reprint the books from the film, or they can
                        translate its contents into Chinese and reprint it.</p>
                    <p>First, the Department needed a light microfilm reading machine to distribute.
                        A cultural relations officer worked with the National Archives in designing
                        a two-pound microfilm reader which can go to China by air. The Archives were
                        given an order in June for one hundred at an approximate cost of $25.00
                        each, or a total of $2,500.</p>
                    <p>Two 100-foot reels of microfilm were prepared in June to accompany the first
                        readers. These reels contained 1,600 pages of material on postwar planning
                        and 1,900 pages of recent scientific and scholarly journals. One print of
                        each film will be presented to each of the major university centers in West
                        China, together with several readers.</p>
                    <p>Some magazines have also been sent in paper form. Nine subscriptions to
                        American periodicals were placed in April on instructions from the
                        Ambassador, and are going to China by diplomatic pouch for use in a reading
                        room at the Chinese national capital.</p>

                    <p>Considerable research was desirable before the motion picture project could
                        be launched. In June a sixty-page report was completed summarizing
                        information available in the United States regarding available Chinese
                        projectors, the necessary personnel to operate them, and Chinese experience
                        during the last ten years in the use of American educational pictures. This
                        report is considered accurate for information up to 1940, but newer data is
                        needed from the Embassy.</p>
                    <p>In May and June the Division forwarded to Chungking by air, eight reels of
                        educational, 16 mm. sound pictures, sufficient to make a <pb n="717"
                            xml:id="pg_717" facs="0727"/>two hour program. No reports have yet been
                        received on the use of these films because some are still en route.
                        Twenty-one other reels have been procured for China.</p>
                    <p>The first Government picture with Chinese titles was completed in June for
                        the cultural relations program. A Chinese artist and author in New York
                        prepared the titles which were photographed and superimposed on the American
                        film. This demonstration order was considered very satisfactory. The same
                        Chinese author is now preparing three reels of Chinese voice track for
                        American pictures. When the problems of the Chinese dialects and written
                        language have been fully examined, the Department will be prepared to place
                        larger orders.</p>
                    <p>The production of one new picture was started in June especially for the
                        China cultural relations program. The War Department, at its own expense,
                        has several camera crews photographing Chinese air cadets in Arizona and
                        Florida. The script is being written under the direction of cultural
                        relations officers. The film will be edited in Hollywood in August.</p>

                    <p>The $5,000 allocated for radio broadcasts will be used, in collaboration with
                        the Office of War Information, for broadcasts of a cultural nature which the

                    <p>The $1,000 allocated for a conference in this country on cultural relations
                        with China was postponed until a thorough study could be completed on the
                        cultural activities being conducted by 97 nongovernmental American

                        for distribution. The Department will begin drafting plans for the
                        conference in the near future.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The China Cultural Relations program contains certain projects which have
                        some apparent similarity to those of other agencies. The <pb n="718"
                            xml:id="pg_718" facs="0728"/>Department has established liaison with
                        each of these agencies through a formal letter or official call, and
                        continued its collaboration by frequent and in some cases almost daily
                        consultation. A brief summary of this liaison work follows:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Board of Economic Warfare</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Both the Department and the B. E. W. have considered plans to send one or
                        more experts to China, but the functions of the experts sent by these two
                        branches of the Government would be quite different. Specialists sent by the
                        Department will serve the Chinese Government; those sent by the B. E. W.
                        will serve our Government.</p>
                    <p>The Department, under its 1942 cultural relations budget, offered to give to
                        the Chinese Government the services of ten American specialists. The Chinese
                        Government was permitted to state the types of experts which it needed.
                        These Americans would undertake work prescribed by the Chinese, not by this
                        Government. They would perform a service comparable to our Government
                        employees who were loaned to Latin American governments under Public Law
                            63<note n="20" xml:id="d620fn1">Approved May 3, 1939; 53 Stat.
                            652.</note>—76th Congress.</p>
                    <p>The B. E. W., on the other hand, has proposed the sending of Americans to do
                        work for this Government as gatherers of economic information, as expediters
                        of strategic materials being shipped to the United States, and as advisers
                        on the foreign production of war materials which will reduce American
                        exports.</p>
                    <p>In practice the B. E. W. has asked to send only one American to China—a
                        petroleum expert to be attached to the Embassy at Chungking. This man has
                        not yet been sent; therefore, the B. E. W. has no American technicians as
                        yet in China. That agency now has no plans to send specialists other than
                        the petroleum expert to China.</p>
                    <p>There appears to be no conflict or overlapping in the functions which these
                        two branches of the Government seek to perform. It is possible that a man
                        sent to China for one function might remain there to carry out the function
                        of the other organization, thus saving travel costs from the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>The Department’s Cultural Relations officers have collaborated closely with
                        the B. E. W. in the selection of specialists who will serve in China under
                        the Department. For example, when the list of ten experts requested by the
                        Chinese was received by the Department on March 27, the B. E. W. was
                        apprised of its content. Higher officers of the Department consulted with
                        the B. E. W. and authorized the Division of Cultural Relations to proceed
                        with its plans.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Alex Taub, Chief of the Engineering Branch, Imports Office of the B. E.
                        W., has assigned three of his officers to interview candidates <pb n="719"
                            xml:id="pg_719" facs="0729"/>for service under the Department’s Cultural
                        Relations program in China.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Charles Rayner, Chief of the Far Eastern Division in the B. E. W., has
                        been kept informed of the progress in this selection.</p>
                    <p>Aside from this informal type of liaison, an automatic channel of
                        collaboration has been in force.</p>
                    <p>On February 26, 1942, the Department notified most executive agencies,
                        including the B. E. W., that any plans for sending personnel on foreign
                        assignments must first be submitted to a committee composed of Mr. Sumner
                        Welles, Mr. Dean Acheson, and Mr. G. Howland Shaw, all of the Department.
                        (See attached copy of Departmental Order 1052.<note n="20a" xml:id="d620fn2"
                            >Not printed.</note>) The Department set up in the Division of Foreign
                        Service Administration a file of all government representatives abroad. This
                        would prevent any duplication in plans or in personnel already abroad for
                        the various branches of the Government.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Lend-Lease Administration</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Lend-Lease is authorized to send to China only the type of specialists who
                        can contribute directly to the Chinese military effort.</p>
                    <p>In practice, Lend-Lease has paid the cost of seventeen Americans in China.
                        Sixteen were in the Public Health antimalarial mission which worked along
                        the communication lines that were bringing military supplies from Burma. The
                        only other specialist was an Army veterinary doctor who was sent to work
                        among the pack animals bringing military supplies from Russia.</p>
                    <p>Lend-Lease and the cultural relations officers have maintained close
                        collaboration on questions involving American experts. Dr. Lauchlin Currie,
                        Administrative Assistant to the President, and adviser on Lend-Lease aid to
                        China, was consulted even before the cultural relations program was set up.
                        He has received copies of all important telegrams to and from Chungking on
                        this subject.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Benjamin Schaberg, liaison officer in the China section of the Lend-Lease
                        Administration, has notified the cultural relations officer whenever Chinese
                        officials in Washington have inquired about American experts.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Office of “War Information</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The Department and the O. W. I. both have plans for sending to China
                        microfilms, motion pictures, radio programs, and magazines, but the content
                        matter would be entirely different and in most cases the two programs would
                        reach a different economic and social level in China.</p>
                    <p>The O. W. I. sends war information and current opinion of propaganda value.
                        The Department sends educational and scientific materials of value to
                        Chinese universities and to those intellectual leaders who are guiding the
                        Chinese war effort.</p>
                    <pb n="720" xml:id="pg_720" facs="0730"/>
                    <p>The Department has been in constant touch with the following officials of the
                        Foreign Information Service in the O. W. I.: Mr. Carl Crow, Coordinator for
                        the Far East; Mr. Walter Wilgus, chief of the Far Eastern Radio staff in
                        Washington; Mr. Edward Stanley, in charge of publications in New York; and
                        Mr. Lacy Kastner, in charge of motion pictures in New York.</p>
                    <p>One cultural relations officer spent three days during June discussing with
                        the O. W. I. staff in New York their plans. The conclusions reached
                        were:</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Microfilm</hi>. The O. W. I. is
                        microfilming only selected magazines of current news and opinion. The
                        cultural relations program is microfilming only scientific and learned
                        journals and materials of special interest to Chinese universities.</p>
                    <p>The O. W. I. has its microfilming done under contract by the New York Public
                        Library and by Recordak Corporation; the cultural relations microfilming is
                        done by the Library of Congress and by the Department of Agriculture, both
                        on a reimbursable basis. It is understood that the Government microfilming
                        in Washington is less expensive, but slower.</p>
                    <p>Since the O. W. I. microfilms are intended only for delivery to Chinese
                        newspapers and magazines, to be translated into Chinese, that requires only
                        one microfilm reader. The cultural relations microfilms are being
                        distributed widely to Chinese college campuses where they will be read from
                        the film; therefore, the cultural relations program provides funds for one
                        hundred reading machines in the current budget. (It is important to note
                        that the O. W. I. is sending a few film strip projectors to be used for
                        propaganda pictures, but which are unsuitable for microfilm purposes.)</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Magazines</hi>. The O. W. I. is
                        sending no magazines to China except those in microfilm for Chinese
                        translation. The Department is sending a few journals of educational value
                        in paper form for Chinese reading rooms on university campuses.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Motion Pictures</hi>. The O. W.
                        I. is sending newsreels and some war propaganda pictures to China. The
                        cultural relations program is restricting its films to educational pictures
                        on such subjects as health, agriculture, science, and the American way of
                        life. The O. W. I. films all have a military bearing. The cultural relations
                        pictures all would be suitable for a permanent educational film library in
                        China, although they are now being selected on the basis of their scientific
                        or educational value in China’s war effort.</p>
                    <p>Both the O. W. I. and the cultural relations program are relying upon Chinese
                        Government projectors.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Radio Programs</hi>. The O. W.
                        I. is now sending only news broadcasts to China. The programs go by
                        shortwave from San Francisco <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0731"/>to
                        Chungking, where some are rebroadcast by medium wave. The cultural relations
                        program proposes to have scripts written on scientific and educational
                        subjects, comparable to the subject matter of the motion picture films, and
                        to send to Chungking either a recording in Chinese of such programs or the
                        scripts, which can be translated and prepared for broadcast there. The
                        Department of Interior has offered to do the recordings on a reimbursable
                        basis if the Ambassador at Chungking advises that recordings are
                        suitable.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Chinese Government have approached the Far East Development Company, and
                        have asked for their technical service in developing various power,
                        transport and mining projects in the Western Provinces of China, both now
                        and after the war. The Far East Development Company is a combination of a
                        number of British manufacturing firms producing supplies for public
                        utilities, of which the financial control rests with Power Securities
                        Corporation Limited and Associated Electric Industries Limited. The Company
                        and their associates are of first-class standing, and it is understood that
                        they are well known in American financial circles.</p>
                    <p>2. The Company has been invited by the Chinese Government to send technical
                        experts to advise on the development, particularly in Szechuen and Yunnan,
                        of hydro electric and transport schemes, and on the possibility of opening
                        certain mines.</p>
                    <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0732"/>
                    <p>3. The Company has no intention of seeking “concessions” of the pre-war kind,
                        but hope to be able to participate in Chinese undertakings. They realize
                        that the Chinese Government will no longer tolerate foreign control of
                        native industries or permit foreign interference with Chinese domestic
                        affairs. It has also been made clear to the Company that funds or supplies
                        from the United Kingdom for the projects in mind are out of the question
                        until there is a major improvement in the supply and transportation
                        position.</p>
                    <p>4. On the above understanding the Company are willing to undertake the
                        desired investigations on behalf of the Chinese Government, and propose to
                        send experts—possibly Mr. E. M. Bergstrom and Mr. H. C. Young—to China for
                        the purpose. They will keep the British authorities informed of their
                        progress, and are also anxious that the position should be explained to the
                        United States Government. Indeed the Company anticipate if the scheme
                        materializes they may have to seek American participation in the provision
                        of funds and materials.</p>
                    <p>5. Since the Chinese Ambassador in London has asked His Majesty’s Government
                        to give travel facilities to the Company’s experts and since the
                        investigation is to be undertaken at the request of and for the benefit of
                        the Chinese Government, His Majesty’s Government feel it difficult to refuse
                        the Ambassador’s request merely on the grounds that the projects might later
                        be found to conflict with as yet undefined plans for post-war
                        reconstruction.</p>
                    <p>6. Unless, therefore, the United States Government see strong objection, His
                        Majesty’s Government do not propose to try to prevent the visit of these
                        experts, but before granting them the necessary exit permits they will
                        endeavour to obtain confirmation from Chungking that their visit is still
                        desired by the Chinese Government. It is some time since the Chinese
                        authorities first approached the Company, and it may be that they have since
                        changed their minds.</p>
                    <p>7. His Majesty’s Government would be glad to know the views of the United
                        States Government on the foregoing matter. They would too be interested to
                        know whether a similar approach has been made by the Chinese authorities to
                        any American concern.</p>

                    <p>The Department of State refers to the British Embassy’s <hi rend="italic"
                            >aide-mémoire</hi> of August 29, 1942 in regard to a proposal by the
                        Chinese <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0733"/>Government that the Far
                        Eastern Development Company, a British firm, send technical experts to
                        China, and wishes to thank the Embassy for its courtesy in furnishing the
                        information contained therein. It is noted that the British Embassy desires
                        an expression of the Department’s views in the matter and asks to be
                        informed whether a similar approach has been made by the Chinese authorities
                        to any American concern.</p>
                    <p>As regards the question of the desirability of the proposal, it would seem to
                        us that this particular phase of the matter is one which would lie between
                        the Chinese Government and the British Government. If the Chinese Government
                        should desire the services of such experts, and if it appears that their
                        services would make a concrete contribution to the common war effort, there
                        would not, of course, arise any question of any deterrent considerations on
                        the part of this Government. If the project is carried out, the Department
                        of State would appreciate receiving any information in regard to the work of
                        the technical experts and the results of their mission which the British
                        Government might care to make available. It may be added that there has been
                        some preliminary consideration within this Government to the sending of an
                        economic group to China, but the matter has not so far been discussed with
                        the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>So far as the Department is aware no similar request of an American firm has
                        been made by the Chinese Government. Inquiry in the matter is being made by
                        telegraph of the American Embassy at Chungking and if any affirmative
                        information is received the Department will expect to inform the British
                        Embassy in due course.</p>

                    <p>953. The Department desires to enable six Chinese universities to select one
                        representative each from their professorial staffs to come to the United
                        States for residence of about one year in order that such representatives
                        may have the opportunity to benefit themselves by further studies in their
                        particular subjects and benefit their institutions through contact with
                        developments in the general educational field. Opportunity would likewise
                        arise for them to bring Chinese educational and other needs to the notice of
                        interested parties by lectures, speeches, or interviews. Representatives
                        should be selected with these points in mind. Each man would receive $10.00
                        per diem from day of departure from China until return and $500 for the
                        purchase in the United States of needed equipment. Transportation costs will
                        be defrayed abroad and in the United States and travel to and from the
                        United States will be by air if this can be arranged but candidates should
                        be willing to travel by sea. The American Government assumes no
                        responsibility in connection with travel risks. The Department contemplates,
                        unless the Embassy perceives objection, extending invitations to the
                        National Central University Chungking, National Southwest Associated
                        University Kunming, National Yunnan University Kunming, National Sun Yat Sen
                        University Kwangtung, National Szechuan University Omei, and Wuhan
                        University. The <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0735"/>Department would
                        prefer that each institution be given responsibility for selecting its own
                        representative and therefore would suggest a direct invitation but since
                        appointees must ultimately be approved by the National Government
                        invitations may be sent through National Government channels rather than
                        directly, if this seems desirable. Unless the Embassy perceives objections,
                        it is authorized to send invitations at once and afford necessary subsequent
                        assistance in carrying out this project. In order that arrangements may be
                        made for travel the Embassy should telegraph name of each appointee and
                        approximate date of departure as soon as notification is received.</p>

                    <p>1210. Your 953, October 13, 9 p.m. The list of universities to which
                        invitations should be extended omits National Chekiang University which
                        according to Embassy’s information is ranked in academic opinion with
                        National Central, National Southwestern and Wuhan Universities as having a
                        common high standard, while National Sun Yat Sen, National Yunnan and
                        National Szechuan Universities are reported to maintain lower standards as
                        regards both faculty and curriculum. The two last named however are reported
                        to be specially favored by the Minister of Education.</p>
                    <p>Department may wish to reconsider list of universities to which invitations
                        should be sent, and at the same time it might wish to consider substituting
                        Academia Sinica and perhaps Nankai Institute of Economics which while
                        technically connected with Southwestern University maintains a
                        semi-independent status at Chungking.</p>
                    <p>I await further instructions before extending invitations and at the same
                        time request information as to who will bear tuition costs and what is
                        intended to be covered by the allowance for “equipment”.</p>

                    <p>995. Your 1210, October 21, 11 a.m. Department believes that National
                        Chekiang University may advisably be substituted for Sun Yat Sen University
                        but desires to retain National Yunnan and Szechuan Universities as a measure
                        of encouragement to West China. <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0736"/>The

                    <p>1028. 1. Your reports on the Chinese-American Institute of Cultural Relations
                        seem to indicate that the institute is firmly established and is engaged in
                        activities well calculated to promote cultural relations between the United
                        States and China. On July 23, 1942 the President made funds available for
                        “contributions to Chinese cultural institutes” and the Department is
                        prepared to contribute to the Chinese-American Institute in support of its
                        activities during the remainder of the present fiscal year not to exceed
                        $18,000.</p>
                    <p>2. While the institute will be free to expend this money during this fiscal
                        year in any way it deems most useful in promoting such cultural relations
                        the Department desires to suggest for the institute’s consideration the
                        possible advisability of using the money in part for establishing branches
                        in other cities, purchasing locally physical equipment including motion
                        picture projectors if obtainable, engaging competent secretaries and for
                        such activities as collecting biographical data concerning Chinese returned
                        students from the United States. After investigation by the institute please
                        report whether used sound or silent projectors can be obtained in China
                        possibly from some other branch of the Chinese Government. The Department
                        might be able to send spare parts by plane.</p>
                    <p>3. A statement later on of the purposes for which these funds have been used
                        and of the results achieved would be of interest to the Department in
                        considering the advisability of continuing the contribution after the
                        present year. The Department will welcome your suggestions for the supply to
                        the institute of equipment that may not be obtainable in China such as
                        motion picture projectors, educational films, books, magazines, microfilms
                        and projectors and phonographs and records. Shipment of such articles would
                        of course depend upon the availability of transportation facilities.</p>
                    <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0737"/>
                    <p>4. The Embassy is hereby authorized to transfer this contribution to the
                        Institute in amounts and at times suggested by the Institute up to a total
                        of $18,000. No vouchers are required other than receipts from the Institute
                        on Form 1034 designating the amount as a contribution from the American
                        Government toward carrying out a program of Chinese-American cultural
                        relations. In drawing on the Department for this purpose charge to
                        appropriation 19–112/30006.009 Emergency Fund for the President, National
                        Defense (Allotment to State) 1942 and 1943.</p>

                                homes of numerous Chinese citizens who, owning property and attacked
                                    [<hi rend="italic">attached?</hi>] by long residence, would have
                                been willing to make sacrifices and join in the fight against the
                                common enemy. Unfortunately they were not practically utilized and
                                an opportunity was lost. However, there are at present several tens
                                of thousands of Chinese in Hawaii of whom many must be of military
                                age. The Chinese Government feels that no further opportunity should
                                be lost and that a Chinese volunteer corps should speedily be
                                organized to fight in conjunction with the Allied forces. The
                                Ministry therefore requests the Embassy to despatch a telegram
                                without delay to the American Government asking its prompt agreement
                                and reply.”</p>

                    <p>According to unpublished figures of the Bureau of the Census, there were in
                        1940 in the Hawaiian Islands 28,774 persons of the Chinese race, of whom
                        23,930 were “native born” and 4,844 were “foreign born”. The Bureau states
                        that 6,138 of the “native born” and 427 of the “foreign born” fell within
                        the age group 18 to 44. Persons in the “native born” category would
                        presumably be American citizens and those of military age would be subject
                        to military service under the Selective Service Act.<note n="3"

                        Department reports that a careful study has been made of the Chinese
                        Government’s suggestion that a volunteer corps be organized from among
                        Chinese in Hawaii. It states that a substantial proportion of the Chinese in
                        Hawaii are now performing important civil defense and other duties essential
                        to the welfare of the Territory, and that others have been inducted into the
                        armed forces. While fully appreciating the sentiment of the Chinese
                        Government, the War Department feels that it would be impracticable at this
                        time to relieve these men from their duties in order to form a separate

                    <p>287. Department’s 218, March 23 [<hi rend="italic">25</hi>], midnight. The
                        United Press report is based upon an address made by Sun Fo before a local
                        cultural association which subsequently appeared in the Chinese language
                        press in abbreviated form. The extracts reported by the United Press
                        correspondent are substantially correct although Dr. Sun, rather than
                        announce the adoption of a Pacific Charter, stated <pb n="731"
                            xml:id="pg_731" facs="0741"/>that the Atlantic Charter could, and
                        expressed confidence that it did, apply to all parts of the world.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy believes that Dr. Sun (1) in bespeaking independence for Indians,
                        Indochinese, Koreans and other peoples and (2) in asking recognition of the
                        Korean Provisional Government was not acting under the instructions of his
                        Government or with its foreknowledge. With respect to (1), there is little
                        reason to doubt however that the Chinese favor independence for India and
                        other eastern countries, but with respect to (2) the Chinese Foreign Office
                        has made it clear to the Embassy that it is not yet prepared to accord
                        recognition to the Korean Provisional Government.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Sun Fo by virtue of his family position<note n="2" xml:id="d633fn2">As
                            son of Sun Yat-sen.</note> assumes and apparently is [able?] to procure
                        greater freedom of expression on political matters than is the case with
                        other party and Government officials. It is not believed, however, that his
                        influence in party councils is commensurate with his position or that
                        declarations by him are necessarily recognized by the Chinese Government[’s]
                        responsible officials.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose for the
                        Department’s information a copy of a bulletin of the China Information
                        Committee (propaganda release of the Ministry of Information) dated May 12,
                            1942,<note n="3" xml:id="d634fn3">Not reprinted.</note> concerning the
                        formation of the South Seas Chinese Association on May 10, 1942, at
                        Chungking.</p>
                    <p>The Association’s aims, as stated in the bulletin, are the wartime relief of
                        overseas Chinese from the South Seas and the postwar reconstruction of
                        Chinese enterprises in those areas. Its board of directors and ranking
                        officers are composed of the leaders of the Kuomintang Party, testifying to
                        the importance placed by the party in strengthening the ties between China
                        and the Chinese of the South Seas. The efforts of the Chinese Government to
                        obtain the support of these overseas Chinese has both political and economic
                        significance in view of their numbers and their economic position in the
                        past in the South Seas region. It should be noted that those persons of
                        Chinese <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0742"/>race resident in foreign
                        countries, who under the laws of those countries are considered as citizens
                        thereof, are held by Chinese nationality laws to be Chinese citizens.</p>

                    <p>720. Sun Fo, President of the Legislative Yuan, in a speech on June 5
                        predicted that after the war “Indochina, Burma and India will regain their
                        sovereignty” and Wu Te-chen, Secretary General of the Kuomintang, in a
                        speech on June 12 several times declared that after the war Burma shall be
                        free. These declarations are representative of Chinese tendency to consider
                        that China shall be the leader of Asiatic peoples.</p>

                        <p>During a general conversation this afternoon at the Ministry of Foreign
                            Affairs with Dr. Yang Yun-chu, Director of the Eastern <pb n="733"
                                xml:id="pg_733" facs="0743"/>Asiatic Affairs Department, I mentioned
                            the several recent statements in the Chinese press about the return of
                            Formosa and the Liu Chius to China after the war.</p>
                        <p>Regarding Formosa, he said that its return seemed fitting to the Chinese
                            because the greater part of the population was Chinese and had continued
                            to maintain close ties with China.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the Liu Chius, he said that it was unfortunately inevitable
                            during wartime that there should be exaggerated statements by private
                            individuals concerning war aims; that the truth of the matter was that
                            the people of the Liu Chius were not Chinese and the number of Chinese
                            residents there probably were not more than a few tens, that the
                            islands, which had only been tributary to China, had been entirely
                            separated from it for almost eighty years; that they were unimportant
                            economically and strategically, and that they were now in effect an
                            integral part of Japan, to which they were geographically closely
                            related. He was sure, therefore, that neither the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs nor any other part of the Chinese Government contemplated their
                            return to China in a peace settlement.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday I called on Dr. Henry Chang, Director of the American Department of
                        the Foreign Office, and later on Dr. T. F. Tsiang, Director of the Political
                        Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan. <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734"
                            facs="0744"/>Among other matters, we discussed steps that were being
                        taken in Chungking to study post-war problems.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Chang indicated that he had been delegated by the Foreign Office to give
                        special attention to the matter of post-war adjustments. He stated that he
                        had made very little progress, due to the lack of material for pursuing his
                        studies, to the lack of specific determination of the scope of the studies,
                        and to the lack of coordination with other Departments of the Government
                        also interested in such studies. He said he hoped to get organized for real
                        work within a month or two. In the meantime he is undertaking to keep me
                        informed of any interesting developments. He said it would be very helpful
                        to him if he knew what was being done in Washington with regard to the study
                        of post-war problems. He was particularly interested in matters pertaining
                        to organization and scope of research.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Chang foresaw that internal reconstruction would be China’s principal
                        post-war problem. China would need financial support for such
                        reconstruction, and would look to America for that support. If allowed
                        reasonable access to American markets, China would have no difficulty in
                        paying interest and retiring principal on credits extended. There was little
                        or no trade competition between China and the United States. China wanted to
                        export to the United States metals (antimony, tungsten and tin), wood oil
                        (tung oil), silk, tea and other typically non-competitive Chinese products.
                        In return China wanted to import from the United States the materials to
                        build up its industrial and transport system.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Chang emphasized his belief in the necessity of according all nations
                        really free access to raw materials. He said this was especially important
                        in the Far East. Underlining the word “free” he said that access must not
                        only be free from special political preferences but that access must be made
                        free to nations with small capital reserves through a liberal system of
                        credits or raw materials pools. He said that post-war economic policy should
                        be so designed as to leave no excuse for further employment of the term
                        “have not” in reference nations.</p>
                    <p>With regard to political problems after the war, Dr. Chang foresaw Korean
                        independence, disposition of Indochina, the future of Siam, and Malayan
                        adjustments would furnish material for careful study. He made no specific
                        suggestions as to policy but dealt at some length with the question of the
                        Chinese residents in Malaya who he stated constituted over fifty per cent of
                        the entire population and whose influence and interests, particularly in
                        commercial fields, were relatively even greater.</p>
                    <p>Dr. T. F. Tsiang had some weeks ago informed me that, whereas he feared that
                        there would be an inclination in some quarters for <pb n="735"
                            xml:id="pg_735" facs="0745"/>China to play power politics after the war,
                        he hoped that wiser counsels would prevail and that full attention would be
                        devoted to the all important question of internal reconstruction. He told me
                        yesterday that a group had been meeting together in recent weeks discussing
                        post-war problems. He said that he was not a member of the group but heard
                        through friends of the course of the discussions. He suggested that I see
                        Dr. Wang Chung-hui, former Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was a leading
                        member of the group. He said that in so far as he was informed, the group
                        had devoted its attention largely to two questions: the extent to which
                        China should in the post-war period resort to socialization of economic
                        life, and the kind and extent of assistance China would need after the war.
                        With reference to the first question, the majority of the group seemed to be
                        opposed to extensive socialization under the government, preferring
                        regulatory and control measures which left the individual business men
                        initiative and scope for commercial and industrial development. With regard
                        to the second question, he said that the group had discussed the matter of
                        aid from England and had decided that little could be expected from that
                        quarter and that a paper had been prepared setting forth the aid that China
                        would desire and require from the United States. In so far as he knew the
                        group had had no special discussions of political questions.</p>
                    <p>I mentioned a recent editorial that had appeared in a Chungking (Chinese)
                        newspaper in which the point was made that Siam had forfeited its right to
                        independence and that China would have to assume a protectorate over the
                        country after the war. Dr. Tsiang thought this was going a little far. He
                        said that while the proportion of Chinese residents in Siam was not as great
                        as in Malaya, it was considerable and influential, and feared by the
                        Siamese. This fear has been the cause of Siam’s refusal to exchange
                        diplomatic representatives with China.</p>

                    <p>902. Reference to the Department’s 656, July 21, 8 p.m. The Embassy has
                        endeavored to follow opinion (editorial, unofficial and official) in China
                        with regard to postwar problems. Editorial opinion has been concerned very
                        largely with postwar reconstruction within China although attention has been
                        devoted to such obvious political <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0746"
                        />problems as independence of Korea and India, both of which the press
                        favors. China is expected to recover all territory lost since the
                        Sino-Japanese war of 1894 which includes Formosa and Manchuria. The postwar
                        disposition of Indochina causes some concern and one paper has commented
                        that Siam, having forfeited its right to independence by its relations with
                        Japan, should be placed under a Chinese protectorate. However, [there is
                        little?] evidence of jingoism, emphasis being placed upon the goal of
                        freedom for Asiatic peoples insofar as practicable.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of unofficial organizations which are devoting some
                        thought to postwar problems, notably the League of Nations Society and the
                        People’s Foreign Relations Association. Little has been ascertained
                        regarding their studies but they are understood to be unprecise and to
                        follow generally the same lines as the press. Articles in the press are
                        frequently inspired by members of these organizations or by the public
                        utterances of officials.</p>
                    <p>Last year before the outbreak of the Pacific War, an official Chinese
                        organization was established to study postwar problems and planning. The
                        existence and work of the organization was then and is now given no
                        publicity and the following information was obtained in strict confidence.
                        Dr. Wang Chung-hui, then Foreign Minister and now Secretary General of the
                        Supreme National Defense Council, is the head of an organization numbering
                        about 40 members. Dr. Wang was formerly Minister of Justice and Chinese
                        judge on the Permanent Court of International Justice. He explained that the
                        studies of his organization are divided into three categories: (1)
                        organization for international security; (2) economic adjustments,
                        subdivided into (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) rehabilitation and reconstruction
                        problems in China and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) international commercial
                        and economic relationships; and (3) China’s postwar relation with Japan and
                        its Far Eastern political relations in general.</p>
                    <p>With regard to (1), China favors as it has in the past favored international
                        organization for collaboration and security. Disarmament and an
                        international police force are essential to security. So also is a
                        willingness to submit disputes for arbitration without reservation to an
                        impartial non-political tribunal. The treaties to end the war and
                        organization for maintaining peace should be treated separately. The
                        negative or preventative organization for settling disputes should be
                        separated insofar as possible from the positive constructive organization
                        for collaboration and improvement of conditions. The approach of the former
                        should be strictly judicial whereas the latter would be political, economic
                        and social. Dr. Wang spoke with approval of Mr. Welles’<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d639fn6">Sumner Welles, Under Secretary of State.</note>
                        suggestion [of] a “cooling off” <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0747"
                        />period but said that it should be made as short as possible to avoid
                        confusion.</p>
                    <p>With regard to (2), Dr. Wang said that his organization advocated a “go slow”
                        policy toward socialization of industrial life in China; that China looked
                        to America for financial and technical aid to carry out its postwar
                        reconstruction program; that China also looked to America as a market of its
                        exports in order to permit refunding credits and that there was general
                        agreement to follow the lead of Secretary Hull in interest of good neighbor
                        policy in commercial relations (trade agreements, lowered tariff rates,
                        abandonment of nationalistic trade policies, and impartial access to raw and
                        essential materials).</p>
                    <p>With regard to (3), Dr. Wang indicated that studies were in an initial or
                        formative stage. Neither postwar relation with Japan nor Russia were
                        discussed specifically. He said that Korea should have independence; that
                        status of Indochina would depend on position of France at the end of war;
                        and that Thailand should regain independence. He mentioned the large Chinese
                        population of Malaya and preeminent part it played in commercial life but
                        offered no suggestion with regard to postwar plans for that area. He
                        observed that neither the population of Indochina nor that of Netherlands
                        [East] Indies was prepared for self-government. This observation led to a
                        discussion of mandates. Dr. Wang earnestly favored a mandate system with the
                        mandate authority absolutely international and directly under a postwar
                        international organization. He stated that administration should be for the
                        threefold purpose of training the inhabitants to assume the responsibilities
                        of self-government, of developing the economic resources of the mandate area
                        for the benefit of the inhabitants and of maintaining access to the raw
                        materials and materials of these areas on a basis of equality of
                        opportunity.</p>
                    <p>Please treat the source and substance of the foregoing as confidential.</p>

                        southwest China, as an area for mutually beneficial trade relations, and as
                        a defensive outpost. He states that, at the future peace conference China
                        should ask that French Indo-China be given independence, and if the latter
                        should be deemed unprepared for self government, China should offer to
                        become its mandatory nation. He concludes with the statement that China
                        cannot let Indo-China fall into the hands of aggressive Japan nor permit it
                        to lapse into the hands of the French Indo-China government whose surrender
                        to Japan without a determined struggle in the autumn of 1940 sealed the fate
                        of Singapore and Burma.</p>
                    <p>It may be recalled that, in several despatches reporting conversations
                        between the Counselor of Embassy and Chinese officials regarding post war
                        problems, mention has been made of the Chinese attitude toward French
                        Indo-China. Without doubt the Chinese have a very positive interest in the
                        future status of Indo-China. Dr. Wang Chung-hui, chief of an official
                        Chinese organization devoting itself to study of post war problems, has
                        shown such an interest as has also Dr. Tsiang Ting-fu, an influential
                        official of the Executive Yuan.</p>
                    <p>In a recent press conference, answering a correspondent’s question as to
                        whether, in the light of developments in India, he did not feel that those
                        who demand a Pacific Charter were right, Dr. Tsiang, as government
                        spokesman, said that the principles behind the Atlantic Charter were not
                        restricted in application to the Atlantic area alone “but many here feel
                        that a special Pacific Charter—an allied statement on Pacific problems—will
                        be very helpful. However, the Atlantic and Pacific charters must be
                        harmonious in principle, although specific problems may be handled
                        differently because these individual problems are different in nature”.
                        Asked what he thought the Pacific <pb n="739" xml:id="pg_739" facs="0749"
                        />Charter should specifically contain, the spokesman said that such a
                        declaration should recognize the aspirations of certain Pacific countries
                        such as Korea, the Philippines, India, Burma and China. Asked whether French
                        Indo-China would be included, Dr. Tsiang said that Indo-China “was in a
                        slightly different category. I don’t know how we will deal with it, because
                        France has a special position. [”]</p>

                        Warfare has approached T. V. Soong<note n="10" xml:id="d642fn10">Chinese

                        China to consult with Chinese officials regarding postwar reconstruction
                        problems in China. Soong has telegraphed his Government. The source of
                        foregoing is a responsible Chinese official who indicated that Chinese
                        Government is not yet fully prepared to discuss reconstruction problems in
                        any detail but he did not state what reply would be made to Soong.</p>
                    <p>Inasmuch as Embassy has not been advised of Board of Economic Warfare
                        proposal, the above information is communicated to Department on the chance
                        that it has not been consulted by Board of Economic Warfare.<note n="11"

                            xml:id="d643fn12">Not printed.</note> delivered by Dr. Sun Fo, President
                        of the Legislative Yuan, before a meeting of the Four Northeastern
                        Provinces’ War Aid Association on September 18 concerning the postwar status
                        and development of the Northeastern Provinces.</p>

                    <p>The address is of interest in that it envisages full control of the provinces
                        by the Central Government, governmental control of all public utilities,
                        governmental ownership and development of all industrial and mining
                        enterprises, governmental ownership of land and the introduction of a
                        collective farming system and mechanized farm production, a practical
                        government monopoly of foreign trade and the encouragement of mass
                        emigration of Chinese to that area. While due allowance must be made for Dr.
                        Sun’s political beliefs in evaluating the program advanced in his address,
                        the possibility of an attempt to put into effect most of the suggestions
                        made by him cannot be overlooked. Many of those suggestions represent the
                        trend toward governmental enterprises and control of trade which has been
                        increasingly evident in China during recent years, and it is not to be
                        expected that the Chinese Government would overlook an opportunity to
                        introduce such measures in an area from which Japanese interests might be
                        expected to be eliminated and in which there would be no other foreign
                        interest of importance.</p>
                    <p>Chinese editorial comment on September 18, the anniversary of the Mukden
                        Incident, was devoted chiefly to the theme that the present war had its
                        beginning in the Japanese aggression against Manchuria in 1931 and that the
                        expected United Nations victory would result in the end of Japanese military
                        aggression and the return of Manchuria to China, one of whose war aims was
                        the recovery of that area.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday Secretary Philip Sprouse and I called on Dr. Wang Shih-chieh,
                        Executive Secretary of the People’s Political Council, to discuss the recent
                        meeting of the Council. Dr. Wang had told me sometime before the convening
                        of the Council that he would be glad to inform me of the discussions that
                        might take place in the Council meetings of post-war problems and I
                        therefore directed the conversation along those lines. Some of Dr. Wang’s
                        statements were in response to direct questions but for the most part he
                        gave the information unsolicited.</p>
                    <p>With regard to post-war world organization, Dr. Wang referred to a recent
                        address made by Dr. Wang Chung-hui, a leading Kuomintang official and former
                        Chinese judge on the Hague International <pb n="741" xml:id="pg_741"
                            facs="0751"/>Court of Justice, before the Political Science Association.
                        He said that the discussions in the Council with regard to post-war world
                        political organization were along the lines of Dr. Wang Chung-hui’s address
                        and were in substantial agreement with it. A press report of Dr. Wang’s
                        address is attached hereto.</p>
                    <p>With regard to post-war economic problems, Dr. Wang Shih-chieh stated that
                        the Council discussed reconstruction with particular reference to China and
                        was in favor of some form of “post-war lend-lease” to countries such as
                        China which had suffered from the devastations of war and did not have the
                        capital reserves to finance necessary measures of reconstruction. (Such
                        measures as generally understood here are in the fields of industry,
                        transportation and agriculture. The Chinese Government desires to promote
                        light industries for the production of consumers goods and to develop those
                        industries directly related to national defense; that is, steel production
                        and the production of defense armaments. Extension of rail, highway, and air
                        communications is envisaged on a somewhat grandiose scale. With regard to
                        measures in the field of agriculture much is said but little that has been
                        done promises concrete action in regard to the pressing problem of agrarian
                        reform (land tenure, taxation, and improvement). Any post-war lend-lease or
                        other form of material aid to China that might be given should definitely be
                        premised upon the actual undertaking of sound constructive measures by China
                        rather than upon vague ambitions and paper planes [<hi rend="italic"
                            >plans</hi>] and it would not be amiss to stipulate that reconstructive
                        measures for which aid is sought be socially progressive as well as
                        financially and economically sound.)</p>
                    <p>In response to my question Dr. Wang said that the Government’s financial and
                        economic policies had been subject to much discussion particularly with
                        reference to post-war prospects. He said that there had been severe
                        criticism of foreign trade and exchange control, of the government’s
                        monopoly policy, and of the tendency toward nationalization of industry.
                        Government-controlled companies having the exclusive right to handle exports
                        of certain commodities (tung oil, bristles, silk, tea, minerals, etc.) were
                        criticized as inefficient. Although at present excused as a war-time
                        measure, their continuation after the war was feared. Businessmen foresaw a
                        serious curtailment of free commercial enterprise. They also foresaw,
                        through the control of exports, a continuation of government control of
                        foreign exchange into the post-war period and thus virtually a control of
                        all foreign trade, import as well as export. National monopolies of such
                        commodities as cigarettes, matches, sugar, salt, etc., were the subject of
                        much adverse comment. In this connection Dr. Wang expressed the opinion that
                        despite their unpopularity in some quarters, government <pb n="742"
                            xml:id="pg_742" facs="0752"/>monopolies of certain commodities might be
                        expected to continue after the war. He hoped they would become more
                        efficient as revenue producing agencies. Dr. Wang thought also that, despite
                        the complaints registered in the Council meetings, the tendency toward the
                        socialization or nationalization of certain types of industry would carry on
                        after the war. Many of the Council members feared the consequences of
                        government in business but Dr. Wang believed it necessary in an industrially
                        backward country like China that the development of certain industries must
                        be in the hands of the government; industries connected with national
                        defense, for instance. He said that careful distinction should be made
                        between the fields for public enterprise and those for private enterprise
                        and felt that there would be ample room for private industrial enterprise in
                        China alongside national industries.</p>
                    <p>I asked Dr. Wang whether there had been discussion of post-war relations with
                        Japan. I had heard of differences of opinion with regard to the severity
                        with which Japan should be treated after the war. He did not answer the
                        question directly but said that the Council members expected the
                        unconditional return of Manchuria to China and the liberation of Korea. He
                        expressed his opinion that Japan must be given a thorough military
                        defeat.</p>
                    <p>I asked him whether relations with Russia had been discussed. He said that
                        there was unanimous agreement that no opportunity should be overlooked to
                        improve friendly relations with Russia. I asked him how it was thought this
                        could be done. He said that Russia was not suspected of territorial
                        ambitions in the Far East. Manchuria was specifically mentioned. He said,
                        however, that there were problems to be settled with regard to the border
                        regions of Sinkiang and Mongolia. He said that these regions played an
                        important part in relations between Russia and China and that it was
                        important that satisfactory arrangements be reached in regard to them. With
                        regard to the Chinese Communist Party, he said that the Soviet Government
                        had already agreed to refrain from political or social propaganda in China.
                        Without going into detail or being specific as to just what he expected, he
                        expressed the opinion that the United States and England might be of
                        considerable assistance in bringing about a better understanding between
                        Russia and China. He said that the British had their Anglo-Soviet
                            treaty<note n="14" xml:id="d644fn14">Signed at London, May 26, 1942,

                            353.</note> and that American influence with Russia was strong. China
                        would welcome a “pre-peace” agreement on fundamentals with Russia. He did
                        not say why he felt that American and British aid was required to achieve
                        this end.</p>

                    <p>The conversation turned to an account of the Council’s attitude and
                        discussions with regard to purely domestic issues, a report of which Mr.
                        Sprouse has prepared (despatch no. 736 of November 18, 1942<note n="15"

                                the Chinese Political Science Association</hi>

                        <p>Chungking, Nov. 6 (<hi rend="italic">Central</hi>): Addressing the
                            Chinese Political Science Association’s third annual convention on
                            “Post-War International Collective Security” this morning, Dr. Wang
                            Chung-hui, Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council,
                            first traced the reasons for the failure of the past attempt: firstly,
                            the incorporation of the League of Nations Covenant into the Versailles
                            Treaty, secondly, the inherent defects of the League Covenant—it does
                            not strictly outlaw wars; its decisions must be unanimously carried;
                            aggression is not defined; and the enforcement of the League sanctions
                            by League members is arbitrary—thirdly, the United States
                            non-participation in the League and the failure of Germany and Russia to
                            join the League right after the Versailles Conference, and fourthly, the
                            world’s lack of faith in the collective security system. According to
                            Dr. Wang, the fundamental cause of the failure lies in the fact that
                            government and public leaders of various countries, particularly of the
                            member countries, lack sincerity and faith in collective security.</p>
                        <p>Dealing with post-war international organization, Dr. Wang opined that it
                            should at least be intermediary between the League of Nations and the
                            united states of nations whose rights and duties should be considerably
                            expanded and organization strengthened.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the scope of the post-war international peace machinery, Dr.
                            Wang favors the creation of universal as well as regional systems with
                            the latter constituting an integral part of the international
                            organization.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Wang outlined five fundamental conditions for international security:
                            firstly, peaceful settlement of all international disputes, secondly,
                            strict forbiddance of use of force between nations, thirdly, a clear-cut
                            definition of aggression, fourthly, the establishment of a permanent
                            machinery for the execution of diplomatic, economic and military
                            sanctions, and fifthly, periodic reconsideration of treaties which
                            become inapplicable and consideration of international conditions whose
                            continuance might endanger world peace.</p>
                        <p>To eliminate the causes of war, Dr. Wang said, efforts should be directed
                                <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0754"/>toward first, disarmament,
                            second, economic cooperation and third, “moral disarmament” through
                            psychological build-up for peace.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary-General also pointed out there is desirability in modifying
                            the mandatory system in which mandates should be planed [<hi
                                rend="italic">placed?</hi>] under international control with the
                            natives encouraged to take part in the administration since the motive
                            behind mandates should be the promotion of democratic self-government.
                            In case it is found impracticable to set up a world union or united
                            states of nations after the war, Dr. Wang said, the League of Nations
                            should be strengthened along the following lines: firstly, a peace
                            treaty and an international security pact should be completely separated
                            and should be drawn up at two separate conferences; secondly, there must
                            be absolute racial equality; thirdly, the unanimity of votes system must
                            be replaced by the majority rule system; fourthly, international
                            employment of force must be outlawed; fifthly, all international
                            disputes must be settled through pacific means; sixthly, aggression must
                            be clearly and detailedly defined; seventhly, international police
                            should be formed; eighthly, national armed forces should gradually be
                            reduced and those countries violating the disarmament pact should be
                            sanctioned; ninthly, “moral disarmament” should be promoted; tenthly,
                            economic cooperation should be universal as well as regional;
                            eleventhly, there must be clear stipulation when treaties should be
                            reconsidered and when international conditions whose continuance might
                            endanger world peace should be examined; twelfthly, international
                            control of mandates; thirteenthly, under the collective security
                            machinery there should at least be three regions: first, Europe and the
                            Atlantic, second, the Western Hemisphere, and third, Orient and the
                            Pacific; fourteenthly, after the war the International Labor Office
                            should be reorganized into an international social welfare office, while
                            the duties and rights of the international tribune should be
                            expanded.</p>
                        <p>Concluding, Dr. Wang said that after the conclusion of the World War II,
                            China, the United States, Britain and Russia should undertake the
                            responsibility of upholding world peace until the world security system
                            is established.</p>

                    <p>In a fairly intensive discussion of the problems of post-war economic
                        rehabilitation in China, Mr. Blewett expressed his firm belief <pb n="745"
                            xml:id="pg_745" facs="0755"/>that the concerned Powers which would
                        contribute to that rehabilitation, presumably the United States, Great
                        Britain, and the Soviet Union, should insofar as possible maintain a united
                        front on policies and actions in that regard. He expressed the strong
                        conviction that there should be no competing for favors, or trying to steal
                        a march, by one power vis-à-vis another. He went on to say that he
                        considered that the problem of that economic rehabilitation, because of the
                        status of the Chinese people (in terms of intelligence and economic wants),
                        and the number of people and the extent of the national needs, would be
                        perhaps the one biggest thing and that most worth doing in the post-war
                        world. He was nevertheless of the opinion that, inasmuch as the Chinese
                        Government was becoming increasingly autocratic, the possibilities of
                        success of working out properly a vast program for economic construction in
                        China—which, he pointed out, would benefit the rest of the world in an
                        economic sense as well as it would benefit China—depended upon our putting
                        our cards on the table before the Chinese. He believed that we should
                        abandon the present practice of paying unwarranted tribute to the economic
                        and political capacities of the Chinese and that with particular reference
                        to economic projects we should indicate that we were prepared to embark upon
                        them as partners with a hand in the conception and running of them, but that
                        we would not be contented with the mere investment of funds. He considered
                        that we had all the cards on our side and therefore were in a position to
                        apply considerable leverage in connection with the large-scale projects
                        envisaged. He said that he himself thought that much could be done by
                        beginning with people below, in terms of seeing that there were put into
                        practice laws for the betterment of labor and the improvement of factory
                        conditions, and that in general he felt that we could approach the Chinese
                        in regard to particular projects and say that we were prepared to carry them
                        out under certain conditions, and make our stand on that basis. He cited in
                        particular situations existing in Shensi, saying that he thought that one
                        could, for instance, in accordance with such a hypothetical general program
                        approach the groups in control in the so-called Red area with the
                        proposition that certain developments could be effected there if the Chinese
                        on their side were prepared also to meet certain conditions.</p>
                    <p>I agreed in principle with Mr. Blewett’s observations in regard to the
                        desirability of other United Nations avoiding competing for Chinese favors,
                        remarking that it was a common practice in Chinese history for China to play
                        one nation against another when the opportunity <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746"
                            facs="0756"/>offered.<note n="17" xml:id="d645fn17">Unsigned marginal
                            penciled notation: “I suppose it was the Chinese who exploited the
                            Western powers in China!”</note> I said that it was agreed that the need
                        for economic rehabilitation in China would be tremendous, and that that need
                        constituted a powerful lever that we could use to make certain that projects
                        undertaken in China should be economic in nature (using the term “economic”
                        to mean that they would be practical and designed to meet an economic need,
                        instead of political in purpose). I asked whether Mr. Blewett saw any
                        persons or any group of persons whom he thought one might approach in
                        connection with this general matter with a good chance of getting adequate
                        understanding of the significance of the general problem. I followed up my
                        question with another, desiring to be informed whether T. V. Soong might,
                        for example, be considered one through whom a first approach might be made.
                        Mr. Blewett said that he felt that Mr. Soong might prove to be one of the
                        Chinese capable of bringing a broader understanding to the matter, and
                        suggested that it might be well if Mr. Soong were shortly to return to the
                        United States. Mr. Blewett said that he himself had considerable faith in
                        the good sense of the liberal and leftist groups in China.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blewett having made mention of the attitude of the Chinese as expressed
                        in connection with the matter of the appropriation by United China Belief of
                        NC$4,000,000 for the relief of members of Chinese faculties, I, with
                        reference to the cultural relations programs as handled by the American and
                        British Embassies, remarked that I thought that we could probably begin
                        profitably to introduce into the material that we were communicating to the
                        Chinese certain American and British ideas on post-war reconstruction which
                        might be the beginning of education of certain Chinese groups to a
                        realization of the relation of their own economic problems to those of the
                        rest of the postwar world. Mr. Blewett agreed.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose for the
                        Department’s information a translation of an editorial from the <hi
                            rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi> (independent Chinese daily) of December
                        15, 1942, entitled “Problems in the Pacific and Canada”.<note n="18"
                            xml:id="d646fn18">Not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi> takes the opportunity offered by the
                        meeting of the Institute of Pacific Relations in Canada to present what in
                        its <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0757"/>opinion are the three important
                        post-war problems in the Pacific area: (1) how to make Chinese prosperous,
                        (2) how to subdue Japan and (3) how to adjust relations in Southeast Asia.
                        The editorial states that the present hostilities had their origin in the
                        oppression of a weak China by a strong Japan and that permanent peace in the
                        Pacific can be assured only by the emergence of a strong and prosperous
                        China; that severe punishment must be meted out to Japan and her leaders
                        responsible for the war must be brought to trial; that a new Japanese
                        Government must represent the will of the people, the policy of that
                        government to be subject to examination by China; and that the problem of
                        the peoples of Southeast Asia should be easy to solve in accordance with the
                        principles of the Atlantic Charter. China’s position with relation to the
                        freedom and equality of those subject peoples is reaffirmed by reference to
                        Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek’s recent statement that China had
                        responsibilities, not rights, with respect to those people. The editorial
                        concludes with an appeal to Canada to take steps to improve the treatment of
                        overseas Chinese in Canada who are subject to painful restrictions of
                        Canadian immigration laws and discrimination.</p>
                    <p>This editorial reflects the oft-repeated opinion of the Chinese press, which
                        is shared by many in Chinese official circles, that Japan must be thoroughly
                        defeated and her armament industry completely destroyed and that China must
                        emerge as the strong power in the Far East. This opinion is based on the
                        feeling that a strong China can maintain surveillance over Japan and can
                        serve as a restraining influence to prevent further Japanese aggression,
                        thereby offering assurances of permanent peace in the Far East. Accompanying
                        these claims for the necessity of a strong China is the denial that China
                        aspires to the dominant position sought by Japan. As evidence of lack of
                        Chinese aspiration to a position of dominance, the press constantly refers
                        to the Generalissimo’s statement, first made at the closing session of the
                        Third People’s Political Council and repeated on later occasions, that
                        although China is the oldest and largest nation in Asia “it is not for us to
                        talk boastfully of her right to a position of ‘leadership’ and China shall
                        rather regard it as her responsibility to treat peoples of Asia as equals”,
                        toward whom China has responsibilities but not rights.</p>
                    <p>One cannot, however, entirely overlook the occasional references which have
                        appeared in the Chinese press to the treatment of overseas Chinese in
                        Thailand, to the large numbers of Chinese in Malaya, to the question of
                        Burmese independence, to the post-war position of Indochina under a possible
                        Chinese protectorate and to the important position of overseas Chinese in
                        the South Pacific, as evidenced by the resolutions in that regard passed by
                        the Third People’s Political Council <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0758"
                        />and the Tenth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the
                        Kuomintang. One sees increased Chinese attention to neighboring countries
                        and to her border regions in the organization under Chinese auspices of
                        Sino-Burmese and Sino-Korean Cultural Associations, in the attempts at
                        reassertion of Chinese authority in Sinkiang and in the greater emphasis
                        being placed on the border regions of the Northwest and the West, with
                        particular attention to the spread of education among the border tribes. It
                        seems likely, however, that Chinese internal post-war problems will be of
                        such a magnitude as to preclude any possibility in the near future of
                        Chinese assumption of a dominant position in the Far East or of the rise of
                        a Chinese imperialism to succeed that of the Western nations and that of
                        Japan.</p>

                    <p>The French Ambassador<note n="1" xml:id="d647fn1">Gaston Henry-Haye.</note>
                        called upon me at his request. He said he had a most urgent matter to take
                        up with me and he was hoping to see the Secretary at a later date if the
                        Secretary would give him an appointment. He referred to the situation in
                        Indochina and the defensive agreement France had in her weakness and lack of
                        military powers of resistance in the Far East been forced to make with the
                        Japanese Government.<note n="2" xml:id="d647fn2">See telegram No. 919, July

                        had just received a telegram from his Government that the Chinese had stated
                        since the Indochinese authorities were giving facilities to Japan, as a
                        neutral, there could of course be no objection to giving the same facilities
                        to Chinese troops and to Chinese efforts. The French Ambassador said the
                        information they had made them very suspicious but that certain De Gaullist
                        elements, supported by the British, were taking a position against General
                        De Caux [<hi rend="italic">Admiral Decoux</hi>], the French Government
                        Administrator, to put his regime in as unfavorable a position as possible.
                        He said under the defensive agreement with Japan, Indochina still had three
                        and one-half divisions of French troops who had not been disarmed. There
                        were 25,000 Japanese troops in the Tonkin area, but as to other Japanese
                        troops occupying Indochinese territory, they were mostly only passing
                        through the country.</p>
                    <p>He continued that, under instructions from his Government, (he had discussed
                        the situation with Mr. T. V. Soong<note n="3" xml:id="d647fn3">Chinese
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note>) he was bringing this situation to
                        the attention of the State Department. He had stressed to Mr. T. V. Soong
                        that if China massed troops on the northern borders of Tonkin so as to
                        threaten the safety of the 25,000 Japanese <pb n="750" xml:id="pg_750"
                            facs="0760"/>troops there, the Japanese would be forced to augment their
                        garrisons in that area, and, consequently, the defensive agreement made
                        between Indochina and Japan would be broken by the Japanese. In this case
                        the three and one-half divisions of armed troops comprising the French
                        Forces could be used in cooperation with the Chinese effort, and Mr. T. V.
                        Soong had undertaken to point this out to his Government.</p>
                    <p>The French Ambassador said Vichy was concerned as to maintaining her
                        territorial integrity and did not wish to give China any claim for occupying
                        Indochinese territory which, undoubtedly, the Chinese would want to hold at
                        the end of the war. However, if the terms of the Indochina-Japan agreement
                        were violated by Japan, Indochina would be in a position to make common
                        cause with the Chinese forces. The French Ambassador said we must not judge
                        this Indochina political situation entirely from the Indochina point of
                        view. He cited that three and one-half divisions of French armed troops
                        under above circumstances might be used against Japan but that without these
                        attendant circumstances France, and Vichy in particular, would be subject to
                        even more concentrated German pressure than continental France was
                        undergoing at the present time if Indochina took a position versus Japan. He
                        asked if we realized the amount of independence of support it required of
                        the Vichy authorities these days not to completely crumble under the weights
                        and threats that the Germans were bringing to bear for effective
                        cooperation. Thus far, Vichy did not wish to lose Indochina either to the
                        Chinese for fear they would hold it, or to the Japanese because of their
                        forceful occupation of the country with troops at the present time.
                        Nevertheless, the position of Vichy vis-à-vis Germany was also a factor as
                        well as the fact that with justification to break the Japanese agreement,
                        Indochina would be prepared to resist further Japanese aggression.</p>

                        <p>Dr. T. V. Soong called and delivered me a communication which he had
                            received from Dr. Chen, the China Defense Supply representative in
                            Rangoon. The substance of this communication related to the clearing up
                            of the Lend-Lease supply situation in Rangoon, and a suggestion that
                            Colonel Twitty of the American forces there, who has since been
                            relieved, was particularly bitter against the Chinese and was
                            threatening the dissemination of information hostile to the Chinese. I
                            passed this communication on to General Marshall.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d648fn4">George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff, U. S.

                        </p>
                        <p>Dr. Soong also referred to a conversation which he had had with the
                            French Ambassador, Henry-Haye. The French Ambassador indicated that he
                            had heard a rumor to the effect that the Chinese might enter Indo China
                            as a result of the permission granted by the French to the Japanese
                            troops to do so. Henry-Haye stated that Dr. Soong must realize how
                            deplorable any such entry would be from the point of view of
                            French-Chinese relations; that the permission given to the Japanese had
                            been given only as a matter of necessity and that China must not
                            misunderstand it; that it did not offer any satisfactory excuse for the
                            entry of their troops. Dr. Soong reported to me that he had stated in
                            effect that this was an entirely unilateral affair, that the Japanese
                            had been using Indo-Chinese bases for attacks on Chinese territory, and
                            that France could not consider that she was really neutral in this
                            respect; that if even as a matter of necessity the French felt obliged
                            to give access to the Japanese troops, they could not object if as a
                            matter of necessity China felt compelled to protect herself from the
                            action which had been thus induced. Dr. Soong asked specifically whether
                            from a military point of view there was any objection on our part to
                            such a movement by Chinese troops and to what extent it fitted into the
                            unified plan of the Far East. I told Dr. Soong that I would talk to
                            General Marshall about this and let him know. I also advised him that in
                            my judgment he should also communicate with the State Department and
                            advise them of his conversations with Henry-Haye, and that as the
                            question that he posed had political implications as well as military,
                            he should also take up that matter with the State Department.</p>
                        <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0762"/>
                        <p>Dr. Soong also told me that he had heard from the Chinese representative
                            in Stockholm (I am not sure whether this was the Military Attaché or the
                            Ambassador or some other representative, but I got the impression that
                            it was a rather authoritative source) to the effect that the Germans had
                            been demanding passage for troops through Sweden to Finland. The Swedes
                            had refused thus far and Hitler<note n="5" xml:id="d648fn5">Adolf
                                Hitler, German Chief of State, Führer, and Chancellor.</note> was
                            beginning to use some rather ugly terms. As a result, some Swedish
                            troops were being moved into prepared positions and it looked as if the
                            refusal might continue. According to the reports, the Swedes were well
                            supplied with anti-aircraft, artillery, and small arms, and the only
                            thing that they needed was aircraft; and if aircraft were furnished,
                            they were quite sure that Sweden would continue its refusal and would
                            very likely fight the Germans in a very determined fashion if they
                            attempted to force passage.</p>
                        <p>I notified General Marshall of all the information that Dr. Soong had
                            given me and also carried to him the renewed request of Dr. Soong for
                            the appointment of a senior Army officer to go to Chungking.</p>

                    <p>Reference memorandum dated January 10 from the Assistant Secretary of War,
                        Mr. McCloy, to the Assistant Secretary of State, Mr. Acheson, transmitting a
                        memorandum of a conference on January 9 between Mr. McCloy and the Chinese
                        Foreign Minister, with regard to the possible entry of Chinese troops into
                        Indochina.</p>
                    <p>In discussing the political aspects of a possible entry of Chinese troops
                        into Indochina it is assumed that the venture would be undertaken only if
                        there existed a reasonable expectation of military success. If this
                        expectation did not exist, there would appear to be little justification for
                        the venture, especially in view of the reaction such Chinese action might
                        have on Vichy.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps a primary political question relating to a possible entry of Chinese
                        troops into Indochina is what independent authority General <pb n="753"
                            xml:id="pg_753" facs="0763"/>Chiang Kai-shek<note n="7" xml:id="d649fn7"
                            >President of the Chinese Executive Yuan (Premier).</note> is considered
                        as having with respect to the initiation of operations in the China theater
                        of hostilities (it was stated in the White House announcement of January 3
                        that “His Excellency Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has accepted the Supreme
                        Command over all land and air forces of the United Nations which are now or
                        may in the future be operating in the Chinese theater, including initially
                        such portions of Indochina and Thailand as may become available to the
                        troops of the United Nations”). If General Chiang regards himself as the
                        final arbiter of what action is to be taken in this theater we would
                        presumably wish to weigh carefully and express with utmost tact any
                        opposition which we might have to operations which he might contemplate in
                        the area under his command.</p>
                    <p>It would seem that the most important political argument against the entry of
                        Chinese troops into Indochina would be the possible reaction of such a move
                        on Vichy. As indicated by the French Ambassador to Dr. Soong, the French
                        Government at Vichy would view the entry of Chinese troops into Indochina
                        with strong disfavor. It is not inconceivable that the French might utilize
                        such Chinese action as an excuse for closer “collaboration” with the
                        Axis.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the possibility of closer French “collaboration” with the Axis
                        resulting from French resentment at Chinese entry into Indochina, it should
                        not be forgotten that the French are realists of the first order, and that
                        they desire to be on the winning side in the present world war. It is
                        obvious that the driving out of the Japanese from their present bases in
                        Indochina would weaken the Japanese military position and thus react
                        unfavorably on the Axis position in general. This consideration would not be
                        overlooked by the French in their consideration of “collaboration” with the
                        Axis.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, a successful Chinese invasion of Indochina might be expected to
                        have a desirable political effect in China, strengthening the position of
                        those elements favoring a determined prosecution of the war against Japan
                        and discrediting the considerable [<hi rend="italic">any</hi>]<note n="8"
                            xml:id="d649fn8">Revision by Mr. Hamilton.</note> defeatist faction. Nor
                        should there be overlooked the tonic effect of such a victory upon others of
                        the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>In final analysis, the advisability of a Chinese invasion of Indochina would
                        therefore seem to depend upon whether the military advantages plus the
                        desirable political effects of such action would offset a possibly
                        undesirable French reaction.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing observations might be orally conveyed to the War Department,
                        obtaining at the same time the War Department’s estimate of the military
                        feasibility of a Chinese invasion of Indochina.</p>
                    <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0764"/>
                    <p>Until we have a clearer picture of the military possibilities of such an
                        operation, there would seem to be nothing to be gained by taking up the
                        question with the Chinese Foreign Minister.</p>
                    <p>If the French Ambassador raises with us the question of a possible entry of
                        Chinese troops into Indochina it might appropriately be called to his
                        attention, [subject to Eu’s concurrence,]<note n="9" xml:id="d649fn9"
                            >Insertion by Mr. Hamilton.</note> that (1) having permitted Indochina
                        to be used as a base for Japanese attacks on China, the United States and
                        others of the United Nations, the French Government would seem to be in an
                        untenable position to object to the entry of Chinese troops into Indochina,
                        and (2) the French must recognize, even though they may be unwilling to
                        admit it, that Indochina under Japanese “protection” is lost to them,
                        whereas if occupied by one or several of the United Nations it is more
                        likely to be returned to France at the conclusion of hostilities. If the
                        French Ambassador does not broach the question of a possible Chinese
                        invasion of Indochina, there would seem to be no reason for raising the
                        question with him.</p>

                            Certain Considerations</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>French Indochina has been, is, and may increasingly be of great value to
                        Japan in the prosecution of Japan’s war effort.</p>
                    <p>French Indochina is, by virtue of its location, an area of great strategic
                        importance as regards radial operations in which, in her present <pb n="757"
                            xml:id="pg_757" facs="0767"/>plan, Japan is engaged, on land, on water,
                        and in the air. (<hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. Incidentally, in addition to
                        current indications afforded by Japan’s present plans of military operation,
                        reports from Moscow have given an account of a Japanese map in which the
                        island of Formosa has been made a center from which the Japanese have drawn
                        a circle with a 4,000-kilometer radius—which is taken to be an indication of
                        a Japanese geographical-political-military concept. Northern Indochina lies
                        about 1,300 kilometers from the center (Formosa) fixed upon for the purpose
                        of that map and 2,700 kilometers inside of the circumference.)</p>
                    <p>In Indochina the Japanese have acquired, at practically no cost to
                        themselves, good harbors, a few good airports, transportation facilities,
                        barracks and housing, money, and a great variety of important supplies. In
                        that area, the Japanese are compelling 10,000 Frenchmen and 20,000,000
                        natives to give them assistance of one type or another. From that area, the
                        Japanese have been and are drawing food supplies and raw materials for the
                        use of Japan’s military machine and for use in Japan. From that area as a
                        base, they are conducting naval operations and air operations—and they can,
                        whenever they may choose, conduct land operations.</p>
                    <p>At present the Japanese are trying by pressure on Vichy and on the French
                        Indochina Government to effect a turning over to Japan of merchant vessels
                        under the French flag.</p>
                    <p>At present the Japanese are trying by pressure on the French Indochina
                        Government to obtain a promise whereunder the whole of the rice supply
                        surplus of Indochina will be turned over to Japan.</p>
                    <p>In the light of these facts, it is believed that serious thought should be
                        given to the question which Chinese military authorities have raised whether
                        it might not be highly advantageous in the United Nations war strategy to
                        have Chinese armed force invade Indochina.</p>
                    <p>The Military Intelligence Division of the War Department General Staff gave
                        an estimate, as of January 20, that the Japanese effective air strength in
                        Indochina, Thailand and Malaya totaled approximately 720 operating combat
                        planes and that favorable lines of communication afforded Japan access to a
                        considerable number of reserves; that Japan’s offensive has thus far been
                        successful because of air superiority; that if that superiority could be
                        denied Japan, her offensive would collapse; that Indochina appeared to be
                        the key to the situation; that Japan’s western flank was open to attack;
                        that to protect that flank the Japanese probably would launch an offensive
                        against Burma; that such action would secure Japan’s position as far as
                        Indochina is concerned and would at the same time close the Burma Road,<note

                        might be launched from bases in China against Japan’s lines of communication
                        or against Japan; that strong air and ground action against the Japanese in
                        Indochina from Burma would serve two purposes: (1) defensively, protection
                        of Burma, and (2) offensively, possible driving of the Japanese from
                        Indochina, which would cut Japan’s lines of communication and force a
                        withdrawal from points south of Indochina. They stated that if Allied
                        bombers were based in Indochina, the Japanese Navy would not be able to
                        operate—as its units could not be supplied; and that the least result from
                        such an offensive (against Indochina) would be to relieve pressure in
                        southern Malaya and the Dutch East Indies.</p>
                    <p>The French of course do not wish to see Indochina become a theater of combat
                        operations. Vichy in particular has been making diplomatic effort toward
                        preventing such a development. It is believed, however, that, if Chinese
                        forces were to invade Indochina, the French in Indochina would not
                        vigorously associate themselves with the Japanese in resistance to the
                        Chinese invading forces. Possible political effect upon Vichy of a Chinese
                        invasion of Indochina must, of course, be given due consideration. It is
                        doubted whether, at this stage, that effect would be adverse to Allied
                        interests. The position of Vichy as between the Axis powers and the Allied
                        powers is pretty thoroughly established: Vichy is ineffective, and Germany
                        is in position almost completely to dictate. Vichy well knows that unless
                        the Allies win the war Indochina is lost to France forever. Vichy therefore
                        has little or no reason to prefer a continued Japanese occupation of
                        Indochina to an occupation thereof by forces on the Allied side.</p>
                    <p>More than a month ago the Chinese Government communicated to the French
                        authorities in Vichy a memorandum replying to and commenting upon a
                        contention advanced by the French authorities that Indochina possesses a
                        “neutral” status and that the said status should be respected.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows substance of translation of Chinese telegram printed on <ref
                            target="#pg_754">page 754</ref>.]</p>
                    <p>It is understood that there are among French armed forces in Indochina some
                        150 French pilots who are said to be seasoned men and eager to fight. It is
                        doubted whether those pilots would assist the Japanese. It is believed that
                        there is warrant for a surmise that if those pilots once got their planes
                        into the air they would soon disassociate themselves from any connection
                        which they may have had with the Japanese forces; and it is conceived that
                        they might go over to and associate themselves with American, British or
                        Chinese forces operating against Japan in the general theater under
                        reference.</p>
                    <p>Suggestion has been made, in a discussion of the political aspects of a
                        possible entry of Chinese troops into Indochina, that this venture <pb
                            n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0769"/>presumably should be undertaken
                        only if there existed a reasonable expectation of military
                        success.—Consideration of that question presumably would revolve around
                        consideration of what would constitute a “military success”. For a given
                        operation, the condition of “success” may or may not be achievement of a
                        victory. If by an attack in a particular area an enemy can be compelled to
                        divert to that area forces upon which he is relying for important operations
                        according to plan in another area, the operation of attack may be a success
                        even though it may in itself involve a defeat or require an ultimate
                        withdrawal. It is believed that a movement by Chinese forces against
                        Indochina would seriously disturb the smooth working of Japan’s plan of
                        operations and that it might—depending on unpredictable factors—conceivably
                        alter the picture considerably as regards effective use by Japan of
                        Indochina as a base.</p>
                    <p>The War Plans Division of the War Department General Staff has expressed an
                        opinion, as of January 26,<note n="14" xml:id="d653fn14">
                            <hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> that the efforts which French
                        diplomacy is making to prevent possible Allied invasion of French
                        territories is officially inspired, under duress, and for purposes of record
                        rather than representative of French popular opinion and real desire; that
                        the situation in Rangoon and Burma is such as to render an application of
                        pressure from the north desirable toward halting the Japanese advance; that
                        such application of pressure from the north should not be withheld merely
                        because it might partially involve operations against French Indochina; that
                        in as much as French Indochina is in fact occupied by our enemy the
                        associated powers would be justified in striking back through that territory
                        when and if such action appears desirable; that such action would have
                        little if any effect on French reaction in other regions so long as due
                        regard is shown, in the operations, for French interests, such as private
                        property, etc.; and that the British attitude on this question was not
                        known.</p>
                    <p>Undoubtedly the Japanese offensives against Singapore and against Burma are
                        tremendously facilitated by the fact that Japan has water and air bases in
                        Indochina and is able to feed her armies there and in theaters southward,
                        westward and eastward thereof from supplies obtained there (rice).</p>
                    <p>If, by a Chinese attack on Indochina, the Japanese could be compelled to
                        withdraw or divert some of their forces from fronts further south for action
                        in Indochina, it is obvious that from such an operation substantial
                        advantage would accrue to the United Nations’ effort. If, further, the
                        Chinese should be able to seize and hold a position in Indochina or to make
                        the Japanese positions there untenable, the advantage to the United Nations’
                        effort in general would be enormous.</p>

                    <p>In the light of the facts and the estimates outlined above, it is believed
                        that, on the one hand, this Government and the United Nations’ Staffs and
                        Command should not discourage indications by the Chinese of a desire to
                        operate against Indochina, and that, on the other hand, the Allied Staffs
                        and Command might to advantage give common and intensive consideration to
                        the question whether substantial advantage might not be gained from
                        encouraging the Chinese to make such a move—in the near future, if
                        possible—and giving them as full support as may be practically possible for
                        and in the undertaking of such an operation.</p>

                    Roosevelt regarding situation in India</head>
                <p>[Following a visit by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to India in February 1942, he
                    communicated directly to President Roosevelt and also to the American Ambassador
                    in China his views as to the critical political and military situation in India
                    and the urgent need for British action to solve the political problem. He quoted
                    instructions to the Chinese Ambassador in London to present these views to Prime
                    Minister Churchill. On July 25, 1942, Generalissimo Chiang sent another urgent
                    confidential message on the Indian situation to President Roosevelt urging that
                    the United States should advise both Britain and India to seek a reasonable and
                    satisfactory solution. President Roosevelt telegraphed the text of this message
                    to Prime Minister Churchill, asking him for suggestions as to a reply. The Prime
                    Minister replied that the British Government did not believe Chiang’s estimate
                    of the situation correct and expressed the desire that Chiang be persuaded to
                    cease activities as to India and that Roosevelt should not permit pressure to be
                    put on the British Government. President Roosevelt then informed Chiang of
                    British opposition to suggestions from other members of the United Nations as to
                    India and added that under the circumstances it would be wiser for Chiang and
                    himself not to take the mediatory action Chiang, had proposed.</p>

                    status of Korea and the question of recognizing a provisional Korean
                    government</head>
                <p>[In April 1942 the Chinese Government invited the attention of the United States
                    Government to the existence of two rival Korean revolutionary parties operating
                    in China, with adherents in the United States, and stated that it was
                    considering promoting a fusion of these parties and granting recognition to a
                    Korean provisional government. The views of the Government of the United States
                    were requested.</p>
                <p>On May 1 the American Ambassador in China was instructed to inform the Chinese
                    Government that the United States Government had no immediate intention of
                    recognizing any one Korean group in view of lack of unity existing among Korean
                    groups and the probability that these groups had little association with the
                    Korean population in Korea. The Ambassador was instructed, however, to add that
                    the United States Government did not desire to stand in the way of the Chinese
                    Government’s taking any step which it considered wisest after full consideration
                    and that the United States Government must also consider in its actions the
                    possible effect on other free movements in the United States desiring formal
                    recognition as governments. A memorandum by the Secretary of State to President
                    Roosevelt preceding the sending of the above instruction indicated that the
                    situation was complicated by the possibility of support by the Soviet Union of
