<p rend="center">Foreword</p>
<p>(This is not an official statement of policy by the Department of State; it is intended only as a guide to the contents of this volume.)</p>
<p>Since 1861, the Department of State's documentary series <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> has constituted the official record of the foreign policy and diplomacy of the United States. Historians in the Office of the Historian collect, arrange, and annotate the principal documents comprising the record of American foreign policy. The standards for the preparation of the series and the general deadlines for its publication are established by the Foreign Relations of the United States statute of October 28, 1991 (22 <gloss target="#t_USC1">USC</gloss> 4351, et seq.). Volumes in the Foreign Relations series are published when all the necessary editing, declassification, and printing steps have been completed.</p>
<p>The documents in this volume are drawn primarily from the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> Library in Austin, Texas, pertinent decentralized lot files from the Executive Secretariat of the Department of State, and records of the Department of Defense and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency presently stored at the Washington National Records Center, Suitland, Maryland. A distinctive feature of this Foreign Relations volume is that it is the first one to utilize the tape recordings of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>'s telephone conversations. Following access by Department of State historians to these telephone conversations at the Johnson Library in early 1995, Department historians have listened to hundreds of these taped conversations, and transcripts have been prepared of important conversations to supplement the documentary record. While only seven extracts from the telephone conversations are published in editorial notes and footnotes in this volume, they help to document more fully the President's active involvement in the serious discussions about and decisions on arms control matters. They also presage the inclusion of transcripts of other tape recordings of the President's telephone conversations on a wide range of foreign policy subjects in forthcoming Foreign Relations volumes covering the <persName>Johnson</persName> presidency.</p>
<p>Almost all of the documents printed here were originally classified. The former Division of Historical Documents Review of the Department of State, in concert with the appropriate offices in other agencies or governments, carried out the declassification of the selected documents.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the most important of the issues covered. Parenthetical citations are to numbered documents in the text.</p>
<p rend="center">Summary</p>
<p>Following the Kennedy administration's successful negotiation of the Limited Test Ban Treaty, which entered into force in the fall of 1963, the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration developed a series of “new proposals” on arms control and disarmament. (2) Its major initiatives were in the areas of the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and the limitation of strategic missiles, but the administration also developed proposals on banning nuclear weapons from outer space, the cutoff of fissionable materials for the production of nuclear weapons, international safeguards on the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and arms control of the seabed. The most visible achievements of the <persName>Johnson</persName> presidency on arms control were the conclusion of the Outer Space Treaty (1967) and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (1968), but its significant progress in the other areas presaged agreements completed in subsequent administrations.</p>
<p>The Committee of Principals, established in 1958, continued to serve as the main interagency vehicle for developing arms control proposals. Its first effort in the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration was the preparation of initiatives for the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee (<gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>) in Geneva. The principals developed a statement for inclusion in the President's budget message for a cutback in the production of enriched uranium (U-235) by 25 percent and the closing of four plutonium reactors. (1) President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> included this initiative in a message to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> two weeks later and urged the Soviet Union to reciprocate. His message also called for a verified freeze on strategic nuclear offensive and defensive delivery vehicles, establishment of observation posts to reduce the chance of war by miscalculation, and measures to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. (4, 5) Initiating exchanges with Chairman Khrushchev on the cutoff proposal, the President urged the Soviet Union to join the United States and the United Kingdom in announcing further reductions.</p>
<p>
<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> finally agreed to simultaneous announcements on April 20 of additional cutbacks in the production of fissionable materials in the United States and the Soviet Union, and the British Government, which received assurances from the United States on its long-range nuclear needs, acquiesced in these announcements. (10, 11, 15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25) In a message to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> expressed his “great satisfaction with our success” in this initiative and his “hope that we shall continue to make more progress of this kind” on disarmament. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> responded that he would be “equally dynamic and equally flexible in searching out ways to promote peace.” (26, 31)</p>
<p>The U.S. decisions to reduce the production of fissionable materials avoided the question of verification, but the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (<gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>) soon developed a proposal. After complicated bureaucratic bargaining with the other concerned agencies, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> obtained agreement for a policy initiative calling for declared production facilities to be inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency (<gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>), while undeclared facilities would be subject to a limited number of inspections on an adversary basis. (32, 33) The President approved this proposal, which was shortly introduced in the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>. (35)</p>
<p>Little movement was made in discussions with the Soviets on the mutual destruction of obsolescent bomber aircraft, parallel reductions in military budgets, or the establishment of control posts (5, 13, 14, 16, 38, 42, 43, 54, 61), and bilateral talks gradually shifted to other issues. Among these was an initiative calling for a verified freeze on the numbers and characteristics of specific categories of strategic delivery vehicles, which the administration approved in April 1964 after considerable internal debate. (2, 14, 19, 21) The verification provisions were at first rather general but were soon refined in a series of interagency discussions and unveiled in the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> in August 1964. (28, 30, 36, 37)</p>
<p>In the last half of 1964, the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration began intensive discussion of the problem of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. (36, 37, 46, 47, 50, 52, 55) To coordinate this effort, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> created an interagency Committee on Nuclear Weapons Capabilities. Known as the Thompson Committee after its chairman, Ambassador at Large <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Llewellyn Thompson</persName>, the interagency group studied many dimensions of the problem, including non-proliferation initiatives in the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> and the role of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. (45, 48) Moreover, heightened concerns about proliferation following the People Republic of China's explosion of an atomic bomb in October prompted President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> to create a separate Task Force on Nuclear Proliferation. (49, 51) Often referred to as the Gilpatric Committee after its chairman, former Deputy Secretary of Defense Roswell Gilpatric, this group completed its recommendations in January 1965. (56, 59, 60, 63, 64)</p>
<p>U.S. and Soviet senior officials simultaneously began to explore prospects for a non-proliferation agreement. These talks included a meeting between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and an exchange of messages between the President and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s successor. (53, 54, 61, 68)</p>
<p>Conclusion of a nuclear non-proliferation treaty increasingly preoccupied U.S. arms control negotiators. They succeeded ostensibly in uniting the Western nations in the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> by persuading the British to accept the U.S. draft non-proliferation treaty as the basis for negotiation and to refrain from introducing their draft non-proliferation treaty there. The United States also had to deal with Germany, which had forsworn production of nuclear weapons, but wanted establishment of a multilateral force. However, the British insisted on veto power over use of nuclear weapons in any future Atlantic nuclear force (92), and the United States could not legally relinquish control over its nuclear weapons. Moreover, a multilateral force including Germany was anathema to the Soviet Union. (86, 100) These conditions inhibited negotiations on the possibility of forming a multilateral force, but they also made possible the negotiation of a non-proliferation treaty.</p>
<p>On August 17, 1965, the United States introduced its draft treaty at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> in Geneva. With the incorporation of contributions from Canada, Italy, and the United Kingdom, the U.S. draft essentially compromised the original U.S. position. For example, the original article on application of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards to peaceful nuclear activities was diluted despite the opposition of Glenn Seaborg, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, who tried unsuccessfully to get mandatory safeguards restored to the text.</p>
<p>The issue of the possible establishment of a multilateral force and a German role therein held up progress toward conclusion of a non-proliferation treaty. U.S. negotiators repeatedly tried to convince the Soviet Union that the United States could not legally relinquish control over its nuclear weapons, and that consultation within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on nuclear matters did not constitute nuclear proliferation. By October 1966 the Soviet Union apparently accepted the validity of this U.S. position, opening the way for conclusion of a non-proliferation treaty.</p>
<p>No progress was made toward a comprehensive test ban treaty because of the U.S. insistence on monitoring such an agreement with on-site verification, a condition to which the Soviet Union refused to agree. (74, 87, 94) The 1963 limited test ban treaty allowed for underground testing, which the United States and the Soviet Union did throughout this period. (81) Each nation complained that tests of the other vented radioactive materials outside its territorial borders in violation of one of the provisions of the 1963 treaty. (62, 65, 66, 67, 69, 75, 81) The administration apparently tried to conform to the test ban treaty by avoiding nuclear testing of a size and type that vented radioactive materials outside U.S. borders. (76) It confined testing to the Nevada Test Site, although it approved initial development of an adjacent test site in Nevada at Nellis Gunnery Range. It rejected the Atomic Energy Commission's proposal to negotiate for higher yield test sites in central Australia or on Christmas Island, but it authorized an initial survey of possible sites for higher yield tests in Alaska, subject to prior clearance of the survey by the Governor and the Congressional delegation of Alaska. (142)</p>
<p>On May 7, 1966, the President proposed an outer space treaty and outlined its essential elements. The arms control provisions of the treaty consisted of prohibitions on emplacement of weapons of mass destruction and fortifications and other military activities in outer space and on celestial bodies. On May 30, Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> made similar proposals to U.N. Secretary-General <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName>. On June 16, both nations presented draft outer space treaties to the United Nations. Negotiation of an outer space treaty began in the Legal Subcommittee of the Outer Space Committee in Geneva in July 1966. By August 1966, agreement had been reached on a number of provisions of the draft treaty, leaving potentially contentious issues to be resolved in negotiations in New York. (127, 128, 143, 145, 151)</p>
<p>By the end of 1966 negotiations concluded on the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, which was more commonly called the Outer Space Treaty. Confirming on December 8 that an agreement had been reached, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> called it “the most important arms control development since the limited test ban treaty of 1963.” On December 19 the U.N. General Assembly approved the treaty and requested the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union to open it for signature. Opened for signature at Washington, London, and Moscow on January 27, 1967, the Outer Space Treaty was immediately signed by the United States and over 60 other countries. (167, 177)</p>
<p>By late 1966 and into early 1967, officials in the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration discussed plans to engage the Soviet Union in bilateral talks on strategic arms, which they hoped would lead to an agreement to refrain from deploying anti-ballistic missile systems. Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and the President believed that such an agreement would spare both powers important financial outlays while leaving intact the existing arrangement under which the security of each nation was based essentially on the mutual deterrence of their offensive weapons. (173, 174, 175, 176) In this pursuit President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> wrote Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> formally requesting that the United States and the Soviet Union initiate talks to “reach an understanding between us which would curb the strategic arms race.” (178) While waiting for a response, in mid-February the administration further defined its position by instructing the Ambassador to the Soviet Union <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Llewellyn Thompson</persName> to inform Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that the United States was prepared to consider talks on strategic offensive missiles as well as defensive anti-missile systems. (181, 182) Finally, in late February the Soviet Union responded somewhat favorably with two letters of its own. (185, 186) Despite these initial exchanges and further internal U.S. discussions (187, 192, 195), little was accomplished in the following several months; neither the guidelines for such talks nor their time or place, for example, were agreed upon.</p>
<p>Because of Soviet reluctance to commit itself to these strategic missile discussions as well as growing Congressional demands for an anti-missile system, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> began to feel that the United States had no choice but to deploy an anti-ballistic missile (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>) system of its own. He maintained that a full-scale anti-missile defense would cost far more than it was worth and that the best way to counterbalance a Soviet defensive system was to build more and better offensive missiles, but the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not want to stake the nation's security on this reasoning. (176) <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">William C. Foster</persName> and others in the administration expressed a different opinion, arguing vigorously against an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment on the grounds that it could damage negotiations on the non-proliferation treaty. (203, 204) Although this debate swiftly escalated, a compromise was reached and announced by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in a speech at San Francisco in September 1967. (207, 209, 210) Additional documentation on the debate within the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration over whether to develop an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system is scheduled for publication in Foreign Relations, 1964-1968, volume X, National Security Policy.</p>
<p>Parallel with these developments was the intensive effort undertaken by U.S. negotiators at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> in Geneva in early 1967 to reach an agreement on Article III of a non-proliferation treaty. Article III, more commonly referred to as the “safeguards” or “control” article, provided that non-nuclear weapon states would negotiate agreements with the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> in Vienna, either individually or together with other states, for safeguards on all source and special fissionable materials used in their peaceful nuclear activities. The safeguards would be applied exclusively for the purpose of verifying fulfillment of treaty obligations and in a manner designed to avoid hampering peaceful nuclear activities. (183, 188, 189, 190)</p>
<p>International inspection and control were major sticking points, and they presented such a difficult problem in the early stages of the treaty negotiations that the original joint U.S.-Soviet draft submitted to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> on August 24, 1966, left this article blank. The difficulty lay in the relationship between IAEA and such regional organizations as the European Atomic Energy Commission (Euratom), which had its own safeguards system. The United States regarded Euratom safeguards as equivalent to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards, but the Soviet Union objected that the Euratom system was only inspection among allies. For their part, the Euratom countries feared that application of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards to their nuclear industry might hamper their peaceful nuclear power programs and also endanger Euratom, which they regarded as an essential element of progress toward European unity. (172, 180, 182, 196)</p>
<p>A second round of intensive negotiations took place at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> from May to December 1967, during which Foster, the U.S. representative, consulted with the U.S. NATO allies and the Soviet Union to try to reach a compromise on Article III. (196, 198) Meanwhile, following the Glassboro Summit in June 1967 at which President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> met to discuss a number of issues including the non-proliferation treaty, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued discussions on arms control subjects while in New York where they attended a special session of the U.N. General Assembly on the Middle East. (198, 199) Between late August and November, the Soviets showed interest in a compromise to accommodate Euratom, although they insisted that Article III specifically mention only <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards. The Soviet draft of September 1 reflected this accommodation. (200, 205, 206, 208, 212, 218)</p>
<p>By early December 1967, U.S. efforts to reach an agreement on the September 1 draft of the non-proliferation treaty submitted by the Soviet Union and a November 2 formulation submitted by the United States came to a head. (219, 220) At the last co-chairmen's meeting of the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> session, Foster informed his Soviet counterpart <persName corresp="#p_RAA1">Alexey A. Roshchin</persName> that the United States believed that the road to a solution was through the November 2 formula. (223, 224) However, when the two sides realized that negotiations would not be resolved before the end of the year, they agreed to meet again during the next <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> session from January to March 1968. (225)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration also considered Protocol II of the Latin American Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty, which called upon nuclear-weapon states to agree to respect the obligations set forth in the treaty and to promise not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against the contracting parties to the treaty. In mid-February 1968, Foster and other principals recommended that the United States sign Protocol II. (226) Vice President <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> signed Protocol II on behalf of the United States at Mexico City on April 1, 1968.</p>
<p>In March the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to introduce a joint draft non-proliferation treaty which incorporated suggestions by Sweden and the United Kingdom. Thereafter, administration officials became more hopeful that the negotiations would soon come to a successful end. (229)</p>
<p>As final details of the non-proliferation treaty wound down in the spring of 1968, the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration began to consider a new initiative—an arms control agreement for the seabed. At a Committee of Principals meeting in April, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposed that “the United States attempt to negotiate in the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> a treaty, or the relevant provisions for a more general treaty, in which each state undertakes not to station or fix nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction on, within, beneath or to the seabed beyond 12 nautical miles from its coast and up to the coast of any other state.” (233) Dissent quickly came, however, from the Joint Chiefs of Staff who argued that the United States should retain the option to emplace nuclear weapons on the seabed for possible future use, and that it would be difficult to detect violations of any such treaty. (234, 236) A series of further meetings and exchanges of memoranda followed, which served to clarify the issues and parameters of what might be feasible and promising initiatives in this area. (238, 242, 244, 246)</p>
<p>Eager to resume the stalled discussions on limiting strategic defensive and offensive missiles, and with the non-proliferation treaty set for final U.N. General Assembly debate in May, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName> recommended to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> that the United States propose to the Soviet Union early in the debate a joint announcement to begin talks on strategic missiles. (235) Endorsing this initiative, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> proposed to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that the United States and the Soviet Union announce their willingness “to begin bilateral negotiations on an agreement to limit strategic offensive and defensive missiles.” (237, 257, 248) In a letter in late June, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> informed President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> that the Soviet Union accepted this suggestion. (249)</p>
<p>Although the Non-Proliferation Treaty was signed on July 1, 1968, the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August and domestic preoccupation with the presidential campaign delayed Senate action on the agreement until after the Nixon administration took office. (250, 293)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration began to push for the opening of strategic missile talks with the Soviet Union. At the White House signing ceremony for the Non-Proliferation Treaty, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> announced agreement with the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom to begin negotiations on the control of offensive and defensive strategic missile systems. (250) An interagency working group was formed to develop proposals for consideration of the Committee of Principals in preparation for these talks. (251, 253) The principals in turn produced several drafts of position papers (264, 266, 268) and finally, in mid-August 1968, forwarded to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> a position paper that they unanimously endorsed. (269, 273) President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> also exchanged messages confirming the vital significance of these talks for future U.S.-Soviet relations. (261, 263) The Soviets even proposed that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> meet with Soviet leaders in Leningrad in early October and that the strategic missile talks open in Geneva on September 30. (275)</p>
<p>The <persName>Johnson</persName> administration was prepared to announce on August 21 that the President would attend the forthcoming summit, but on the previous evening Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces invaded Czechoslovakia. The invasion forced postponement of the summit announcement as well as opening of the missile negotiations (275), but both initiatives were soon revived in the final months of the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration. (294, 295, 297, 299) In late August President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> tentatively approved papers detailing the initial presentation of the U.S. position and instructions to the U.S. delegation. (277) For its own internal reasons and also perhaps to deflect attention away from the invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Government also seemed genuinely interested in hosting a summit and in starting the missile talks. (262, 280, 292, 293, 296) Taking a proposed U.S. statement on the principles governing the talks (281), Soviet officials reworked it into a proposed joint statement. (287) Responding positively, U.S. policymakers soon completed a draft joint statement of principles for the missile talks. (300, 301, 302)</p>
<p>These efforts were in vain, however. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> hesitated to promote these initiatives at the end of the administration without consultation with the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies. More important, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> seemed to be of two minds. On the one hand, he wondered, given the shortness of time, whether a summit would be worthwhile. (293, 299) On the other hand, he noted on a memorandum summarizing prospects for a summit meeting, “I'm ready. Are they?” (297), and a few days later, on a Rostow memorandum that noted that leaving a summit on missiles to President-elect Nixon might be “a decision we shall regret more than any other in the years ahead,” <persName>Johnson</persName> wrote, “I agree.” (299) In any event, the Soviet leaders also seemed to lose interest. The joint statement was never issued, and no summit meeting took place in the last months of the <persName>Johnson</persName> presidency.</p>
<p>The <persName>Johnson</persName> administration simultaneously considered other arms control matters. In preparation for a meeting of the U.N. Ad Hoc Committee on the Seabed in Rio de Janeiro in August, the Departments of Defense and State agreed to support a resolution declaring that the ocean floor should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and proposing negotiations in the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>. (270) The U.S. delegation won endorsement for these principles at the Rio meeting and with other Western nations developed a statement of legal principles on the exploration and use of the seabed that would serve as a starting point for future U.N. discussions. (279)</p>
<p>
<gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> also pushed once again for a cutoff in the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons under <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards. (250) The Joint Chiefs of Staff opposed a cutoff, however, arguing that U.S. intelligence could not detect with assurance all Soviet facilities that might be making fissionable material for nuclear weapons, and they were successful in calling for further refinement of the proposal. (276, 297) In consequence, no U.S. position had been realized by the end of the <persName>Johnson</persName> presidency. Similarly, interagency divisions prevented any substantive changes in the U.S. position on a comprehensive test ban. (255, 256)</p>
<p>Administration officials also responded to concerns of non-nuclear powers to the arms race. Initially worried that a U.N.-sponsored Non-Nuclear Conference in August and September might receive U.N. General Assembly endorsement to continue as a permanent entity, U.S. officials in Washington and New York, with strong Soviet support, opposed this effort, arguing that it would complicate and delay acceptance of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. (283, 284, 286) The United States promoted a counter-resolution, and the resulting “compromise” resolution generally supported the U.S. position. (302) By the end of 1968, most of the non-nuclear powers appeared at least temporarily appeased on the questions of security assurances and peaceful uses of nuclear energy.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with
                    minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102-138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section
                    198 of P.L. 102-138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic
                    Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume,
                    which was compiled in 1993, meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly
                    standards of selection and editing.</p>

                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the
                    foreign policy of the 5 years (1964-1968) of the administration of <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>. The subseries presents in 34
                    volumes a documentary record of major foreign policy decisions and actions of
                    President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s administration. This
                    volume presents the documentary record of major arms control policies.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Principles of Document Selection for the Foreign
                    Relations Series</p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    the editors are guided by some general principles for the selection of
                    documents. Each editor, in consultation with the General Editor and other senior
                    editors, determines the particular issues and topics to be documented either in
                    detail, in brief, or in summary.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. Individual compiler-editors
                    vary these criteria in accordance with the particular issues and the available
                    documentation. The editors also tend to apply these selection criteria in
                    accordance with their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards of
                    scholarship. In selecting documentation for publication, the editors gave
                    priority to unpublished classified records, rather than previously published
                    records (which are accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>
                <p>Selection Criteria (in general order of priority):</p>
                <p>1. Major foreign affairs commitments made on behalf of the United States to other
                    governments, including those that define or identify the principal foreign
                    affairs interests of the United States;</p>
                <p>2. Major foreign affairs issues, commitments, negotiations, and activities,
                    whether or not major decisions were made, and including dissenting or
                    alternative opinions to the process ultimately adopted;</p>
                <p>3. The decisions, discussions, actions, and considerations of the President, as
                    the official constitutionally responsible for the direction of foreign policy;</p>
                <p>4. The discussions and actions of the National Security Council, the Cabinet, and
                    special Presidential policy groups, including the policy options brought before
                    these bodies or their individual members;</p>
                <p>5. The policy options adopted by or considered by the Secretary of State and the
                    most important actions taken to implement Presidential decisions or policies;</p>
                <p>6. Diplomatic negotiations and conferences, official correspondence, and other
                    exchanges between U.S. representatives and those of other governments that
                    demonstrate the main lines of policy implementation on major issues;</p>
                <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>
                <p>7. Important elements of information that attended Presidential decisions and
                    policy recommendations of the Secretary of State;</p>
                <p>8. Major foreign affairs decisions, negotiations, and commitments undertaken on
                    behalf of the United States by government officials and representatives in other
                    agencies in the foreign affairs community or other branches of government made
                    without the involvement (or even knowledge) of the White House or the Department
                    of State;</p>
                <p>9. The main policy lines of intelligence activities if they constituted major
                    aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward a nation or region or if they provided key
                    information in the formulation of major U.S. policies, including relevant
                    National Intelligence Estimates and Special National Intelligence Estimates as
                    may be declassified;</p>
                <p>10. The role of the Congress in the preparation and execution of particular
                    foreign policies or foreign affairs actions;</p>
                <p>11. Economic aspects of foreign policy;</p>
                <p>12. The main policy lines of U.S. military and economic assistance as well as
                    other types of assistance;</p>
                <p>13. The political-military recommendations, decisions, and activities of the
                    military establishment and major regional military commands as they bear upon
                    the formulation or execution of major U.S. foreign policies;</p>
                <p>14. Diplomatic appointments that reflect major policies or affect policy changes.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Focus of Research and Principles of Selection for Foreign
                    Relations, 1964-1968, Volume XI</p>
                <p>The editors have reviewed the already published official record, particularly the
                    annual publication of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament</hi>, and have examined documentation
                    available in government repositories. They decided to focus the record published
                    in this volume on the following subjects: 1) levels of production of fissionable
                    materials for nuclear weapons production; 2) negotiation of the Nuclear
                    Nonproliferation Treaty; 3) negotiation of the Outer Space Treaty; 4) seabed
                    arms control policies and discussions; 5) nuclear testing policy and its
                    relationship to a possible comprehensive test ban agreement; and 6) the origins
                    of the talks with the Soviet Union on strategic offensive missile and defensive
                    anti-missile systems.</p>
                <p>The volume presents a comprehensive collection of the records of the Committee of
                    Principals, a high-level interagency group that formulated policies on arms
                    control issues for the President's approval. It also presents the authoritative
                    record of the correspondence between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Nikita
                    Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Alexei Kosygin</persName>,
                    the President's Soviet counterparts, on disarmament matters.</p>
                <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>
                <p>The volume includes intelligence information, such as the ability to verify
                    possible arms control agreements, which is contained in National Intelligence
                    Estimates and memoranda prepared in the Department of State's Bureau of
                    Intelligence and Research. The editors did not, however, attempt to document the
                    more technical and scientific dimensions of verification or to explore fully the
                    scope and impact of intelligence gathering on arms control policies. Nor did
                    they seek to document the intelligence available to top policymakers regarding
                    the activities and intentions of the Soviet Union in the arms control area.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Memoranda of
                    conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material
                    omitted from this volume because it was unrelated to the subject of the volume,
                    however, has not been delineated. All brackets that appear in the source text
                    are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides
                    the background of important documents and <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0007"/>policies and indicates whether the President or his major
                    policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been made to determine if a
                    document has been previously published, and, if so, this information has been
                    included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the Foreign Relations statute, reviews records, advises, and makes
                    recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.
                    The Advisory Committee monitors the overall compilation and editorial process of
                    the series and advises on all aspects of the preparation and declassification of
                    the series. Although the Advisory Committee does not attempt to review the
                    contents of individual volumes in the series, it does monitor the overall
                    process and makes recommendations on particular problems that come to its
                    attention.</p>
                <p>Members of the Advisory Committee reviewed the documentation selected for this
                    volume.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The final declassification review of this volume, which was completed in 1996,
                    resulted in the decision to withhold less than one-half of one percent of the
                    documentation selected. One document was denied in full. The remaining
                    documentation provides an account of arms control policies of the U.S.
                    Government during this period.</p>
                <p>The Division of Historical Documents Review of the Office of Freedom of
                    Information, Privacy, and Classification Review, Bureau of Administration,
                    Department of State, conducted the declassification review of the documents
                    published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with the
                    standards set forth in Executive Order 12356 on National Security Information
                    and applicable laws, which was superseded by Executive Order 12958 on April 20,
                    1995.</p>
                <p>Under Executive Order 12356, information that concerns one or more of the
                    following categories, and the disclosure of which reasonably <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0008"/>could be expected to cause damage to the
                    national security, requires classification:</p>
                <p>1) military plans, weapons, or operations;</p>
                <p>2) the vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, projects, or
                    plans relating to the national security;</p>
                <p>3) foreign government information;</p>
                <p>4) intelligence activities (including special activities), or intelligence
                    sources or methods;</p>
                <p>5) <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> or foreign activities of the United
                    States;</p>
                <p>6) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to national security;</p>
                <p>7) U.S. Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;</p>
                <p>8) cryptology; or</p>
                <p>9) a confidential source.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    Series</p>
                <p>The Foreign Relations statute of October 1991 requires that the published record
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all records
                    needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major foreign policy decisions
                    and actions of the U.S. Government. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government cooperate with
                    the Department of State Historian by providing full and complete access to
                    records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing
                    copies of selected records. The editors believe that in terms of access this
                    volume was prepared in accordance with the standards and mandates of this
                    statute.</p>
                <p>The editors had complete access to all the retired records and papers of the
                    Department of State: the central files of the Department; the special
                    decentralized files (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and
                    division levels; the files of the Department's Executive Secretariat, which
                    contain the records of international conferences and high-level official visits,
                    correspondence with foreign leaders by the President and Secretary of State, and
                    memoranda of conversations between the President and Secretary of State and
                    foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic posts. When this volume
                    was compiled, all Department of State records consulted were still in the
                    custody of the Department, and the footnotes citing Department of State files
                    suggest that the Department is the repository. By the time of publication,
                    however, all the Department's indexed central (or decimal) files for these years
                    were permanently transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration
                    (Archives II) at College Park, Maryland. Many of the Department's decentralized
                    office (or lot) files covering this period, which the National Archives deems
                    worthy of permanent retention, will also be transferred from the Department's
                    custody to Archives II over the next several years.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full
                    access to the papers of Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Eisenhower and other
                    White House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and preserved
                    at the Presidential libraries include some of the most significant foreign
                    affairs-related documentation from the Department of State and other Federal
                    agencies including the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence
                    Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>The Department of State arranged for access to the many audiotapes of President
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s telephone conversations
                    that are held at the <persName>Johnson</persName> Library. The first audiotapes
                    became available to the editors in late <pb n="XIV" xml:id="pg_XIV" facs="0014"/>1994, with most audiotapes following during 1995 and 1996. The editors added
                    selected transcripts of the President's relevant telephone conversations to this
                    volume when the audiotapes became available.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have access to records of the Department of
                    Defense, particularly the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
                    Secretaries of Defense and their major assistants.</p>
                <p>Since 1992, the Central Intelligence Agency has provided expanding access to
                    Department of State historians to high-level intelligence documents from those
                    records in the custody of that Agency. This access is arranged and facilitated
                    by the History Staff of the Center for the Study of Intelligence, Central
                    Intelligence Agency, pursuant to a May 1992 memorandum of understanding. This
                    access arrangement was concluded in order to enlarge the scope of coverage as
                    required by the 1991 law. As Department of State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> historians continue to work out the procedural and scholarly
                    aspects of identifying the key portions of the intelligence record, the variety
                    of documentation made available to Department of State historians and ultimately
                    selected for publication in the volumes has expanded.</p>
                <p>All of this documentation has been made available for use in the Foreign
                    Relations series thanks to the consent of these agencies, the assistance of
                    their staffs, and especially the cooperation and support of the National
                    Archives and Records Administration.</p>

                <p>In the planning of this volume documenting U.S. foreign policy on arms control
                    and disarmament issues during the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration,
                    the editors focused their research in the extensive records of the Department of
                    State. The Department of State and Presidential files were supplemented by
                    documents in the records of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (<gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>) and the Department of Defense (<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>) at the Washington National Records Center at
                    Suitland, Maryland. Among the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> records, the
                    editors looked at the office files of the Director, Deputy Director, and
                    Executive Secretariat. They also perused office files of the Secretary of
                    Defense, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs,
                    and the Assistant for Atomic Energy in the Department of Defense records, and
                    they located in the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> records several relevant
                    policy papers on arms control subjects prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>An invaluable source of documentation was the multi-volume Journal of <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Glenn T. Seaborg</persName>, who served as Chairman of the
                    Atomic Energy Commission from 1961 to 1971. Interspersed among his detailed
                    daily journal entries are reproductions of declassified memoranda, minutes of
                    meetings, letters, and other government documents.</p>

                    <p>At 5 p.m. Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GK3">Kermit Gordon</persName> and I met with the
                        President in his office to clarify the President's intentions with respect
                        to the fissionable materials production cut; that is, would it apply only to
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965, or whether the longer-range
                        aspects of cutting to 2000 megawatts and eliminating six reactors were
                            intended.<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">Reference is to a proposal that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> intended to
                            make in his State of the Union address. At a meeting earlier that
                            afternoon, <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BH8">Harold Brown</persName>, Elmer Staats (Deputy
                            Director, Bureau of the Budget), and others discussed the following
                            proposed sentence for this address: “It is in this spirit that we are
                            cutting back our production of enriched uranium by 25%, shutting down
                            four plutonium piles and closing many non-essential military
                            installations.” Because the participants disagreed about whether the
                            President's message should mention longer-range cutbacks or only those
                            for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965, they decided to confer with
                            the President and “if the President wanted to refer only to the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965 cutback in production, the sentence
                            should be modified in order to make this clear.” (Ibid., pp. 182 and
                            186)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I pointed out that I thought if the longer-range aspects were intended, that
                        it would be difficult to negotiate power cuts without an overall
                        longer-range plan. In this connection, I recalled that this longer-range
                        plan of cutting to 2000 megawatts was geared to the 1968 and 1972 peg points
                        of long-range weapons requirements suggested by <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        and Gordon did not support this point of view and felt that the meeting of
                        December 21st was consistent with the view that the decisions had been made
                        only for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965, with the longer-range plan
                        yet to be finalized.<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">For <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>'s notes of the <ref target="#d21">December 21</ref> meeting, see ibid., p. 123. </note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> mentioned his earlier
                        suggestion that the adoption of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>
                        figure of a cut to 3700 megawatts might be reasonable <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0038"/>in order that there would be less of a
                        minimum before it would be necessary to increase power to meet the
                        requirements for civilian purposes. </p>
                    <p>The President decided that, so far as the budget message was concerned, he
                        would refer only to the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965 cuts, and he
                        asked us not to reveal any longer-range plan at this time.<note n="4" xml:id="d1fn4">The sentence in President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s State of the Union message, given at noon on

                            fiscal year we are cutting back our production of enriched uranium by 25

                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had some doubts that he should
                        properly participate, but the President felt that it would be very
                        worthwhile to have him there to bring out the possible connection to arms
                        limitation. (My own impression is that there is some confusion over the
                        details of the decision taken by the President on December 21, 1963, to cut
                        production, that this decision was clearly to cut electric power for U-235
                        production to 2000 megawatts over a three- to four-year period, and to shut
                        down six reactors.) The memorandum prepared for the President (copy of my
                        letter to President of December 19, 1963, attached)<note n="6" xml:id="d1fn6">Ibid., <ref target="#d7">Vol. 7</ref>, pp.
                        103-105.</note> as the basis for the December 21, 1963, meeting supports
                        this view. Perhaps there has been some change in this December 21st position
                        in the meantime of which I had not explicitly been told. </p>
                    <p>Beginning at 5:50 p.m. I called Senators <persName corresp="#p_PJO1">John

                            <persName corresp="#p_HC5">Chet Holifield</persName> and advised them
                        (with the exception of <persName corresp="#p_JHM1">Jackson</persName>—reached on January 8th) that the President has decided
                        to mention in one sentence, in his State of the Union message tomorrow, that
                        he is taking steps to cut back production of fissionable material by 25%
                        (U-235) and closing down four production reactors. I said I had just gotten
                        this word and wanted them to know beforehand. (Note: I mentioned to both
                        Pastore and <persName corresp="#p_HC5">Holifield</persName> that we would

                        January 17th. I asked them to hold that evening free for dinner, and we

                    <p>At 6:05 p.m. I called Elmer Staats (<gloss target="#t_BOB1">BOB</gloss>) and
                        told him that we are going to revise our draft statement on the cutback and
                        that we are now working on the version which I left with him. I said it
                        wasn't clear whether we would issue a statement, but <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, and I would hold a background press briefing at 3
                        p.m., tomorrow, at the State Department. Before that time it can be decided
                        whether or not it will be necessary to issue a statement also. Staats said
                        he would appreciate seeing the statement in the morning.<note n="7" xml:id="d1fn7">This statement was presumably the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> press release; see footnote 5 above. </note>

                        practicable, subject to your advice. We have broken them down into two major
                        fields—A. Nuclear Containment, and B. Immediate Reductions or Limitations of
                        Arms (formerly called separable first stage).</p>
                    <p>The organizing principle of these proposals is that each separate numbered

                        terms. The posture we seek to present is that of a nation which believes
                        that the way to begin is to begin. We are offering a dozen or more ways to
                        begin and are ready to start whenever others will meet us half <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0040"/>way. While many of these proposals are not
                        altogether new, the approach has some novelty and appears to us to match the
                        President's temper and his general purpose.</p>

                        noted that the proposed test program had been circulated to all members of
                        the Review Committee on Underground Nuclear Tests on January 6 for comments
                        and no negative comments or objections had been made. Thus, he and <persName corresp="#p_KSMJ1">Spurgeon Keeny</persName> recommended that the
                        President's previously signed letter of approval be dated and sent to
                            <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> under cover of a
                        transmittal memorandum from Bundy. (Ibid.) The Review Committee on
                        Underground Nuclear Tests was established by President Kennedy in <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> No. 269, October 31, 1963. For text, see

                    <p> Bundy's January 16 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> reads in part: “In making his approval, the President
                        noted that your submittal was based on the understanding that there must be
                        no untoward risk of violation of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty limitations
                        concerning delivery of radioactive debris beyond national boundaries, and
                        your assurance to him that the test program proposed is consistent with such
                        understanding.” (Ibid.) The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed in Moscow on
                        August 10, 1963, and entered into force on October 10, 1963. (14 UST 1313)</p>

                        that 10 shots were carried out under Niblick III, which had been completed,
                        and he requested 14 weapons development tests and 2 Plowshare events for the
                        Niblick IV series in the fourth quarter of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1964. “The Plowshare events,” <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>
                        wrote, “are directed toward the development of clean explosives and

                    <p>In a memorandum to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>,
                        April 9, <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> wrote that

                        reviewed the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> request for the President's
                        approval. The President initialed his approval of the Niblick IV program on
                        this memorandum. (Ibid.) Bundy conveyed the President's approval in an April

                                1963-64</hi>, pp. 171-172.</note> It was decided to add the word
                        “now” at the end of the first sentence of paragraph (2) on page 2. The
                        President asked about the sentence concerning appropriate international
                        verification of the reactor shutdowns already scheduled in our country, and
                        I explained the situation with respect to the three reactors at Hanford and
                        the one reactor at Savannah River, namely, that two of the reactors at
                        Hanford were old and there is no problem of international inspection, but
                        the reactor at Savannah River is essentially the same as the four reactors
                        that would continue to operate, and therefore, there would be problems in
                        revealing the internal construction of this reactor. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked whether there would be problems concerning
                        the inspection of the shutdown reactor at Savannah River if the inspection
                        entailed no more than standing in the door to watch whether operating
                        personnel were working at the reactor, or monitoring the electrical power
                        that was going into the reactor. I said that, with that interpretation,
                        there would be no problem with the language of the last sentence of
                        paragraph (3) on page 3, namely, “… we are prepared to <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0044"/>accept international verification of some or
                        all of the reactor shutdowns already scheduled in our country.” I also
                        pointed out that we might want to start the reactors up again either for the
                        production of electrical power or for production purposes, and it was agreed
                        that this was consistent with the President's statement. The other issue in
                        the statement was whether the paragraph (5) (c), on page 3, should be
                        deleted as the Joint Chiefs of Staff requested, and the President decided
                        that it should be deleted.<note n="4" xml:id="d4fn4">Paragraph (5) (c) in
                            the January 17 draft cited above states: “on the principles which could

                    <p>On Friday, 17 January, shortly after your departure, <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> and I agreed on an amended version
                        of Sorensen's draft of the Presidential statement for Geneva. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> then circulated the draft, which to
                        the best of my knowledge reflected the agreements reached by <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> and
                        yourself the previous day, to all interested agencies for clearance by close
                        of business on the 17th.<note n="3" xml:id="d5fn3">Sorensen's draft has not
                            been found; but regarding the draft submitted to the interested

                            Disarmament Committee in Geneva, January 21, see <ref target="#d4fn3">footnote 3, Document 4</ref>.</note> There were immediate
                        objections from all sides and it looked for awhile as though it would be
                        impossible to clear a paper with anything new in it at all. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> objected to the production freeze and the
                        nuclear free zones.<note n="4" xml:id="d5fn4">See <ref target="#d4fn4">footnote 4, Document 4</ref>.</note> There was also strong
                        opposition within the State Department to the nuclear free zones. Finally,
                        the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> managed to find some alleged

                        reactors involved in the present U.S. cut-back of plutonium production
                        (i.e., one reactor scheduled for shut down at Hanford is immediately
                        adjacent to a reactor that will continue operations and consideration is now
                        being given to operating the closed down Savannah River pile as a commercial

                    <p>On Saturday, 18 January, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Taylor and <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> held a private meeting in which it
                        was concluded that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and State
                        Department would only go along with the statement if the reference to
                        nuclear free zones was eliminated and production freeze was presented in
                        terms of “agree to explore” rather than as an actual proposal.<note n="5" xml:id="d5fn5">No record of this private meeting has been found.</note>
                        Separately, <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> support was obtained by
                        fuzzing the language a bit so that it did not necessarily offer to permit
                        international inspection of all closed down U.S. reactors. Later Saturday
                        afternoon, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Taylor and <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0046"/>were joined by <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> and Carter and they met with the
                        President who approved the attached statement for Geneva (see attachment
                            1).<note n="6" xml:id="d5fn6">No attachments are filed with the source

                        world, I doubt that the final statement was very much weakened over the
                        original draft since the full significance of the semantics was not apparent
                        to anyone who was not acquainted with the internal debate.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday, 19 January, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and members of their staffs held
                        a series of meetings to develop a program to reassure <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> that the Presidential proposal would not
                        affect any U.S. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments. The
                        attached cable of instructions (see attachment 2) forwarded copies of the
                        Presidential statement for Geneva to all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> capitals.<note n="7" xml:id="d5fn7">The President's statement

                        cable, which makes quite a few policy decisions that to my knowledge had not
                        previously been agreed to, was not cleared by anyone in the White House. I
                        complained about neither having been included in the preparation of these
                        instructions nor informed of the results and to my knowledge all subsequent
                        substantive cables have been cleared with either Bromley or myself.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> has actually been very
                        good about keeping me informed on day to day developments.</p>
                    <p>On Tuesday, 21 January, the President delivered the attached television
                        statement to coincide with <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s
                        delivery of the Presidential message at Geneva<note n="8" xml:id="d5fn8">Regarding the President's televised statement at 11:30 a.m., January
                            21, see <ref target="#d4fn5">footnote 5, Document 4</ref>.</note> (see
                        attachment 3). The draft was prepared by Sorensen and cleared with
                        interested agencies just prior to delivery. At the last moment (30 minutes
                        before the President went on the air), the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> formally took the position that the statement in the speech
                        that, “This country and the Soviet Union already have produced enough
                        explosive force to equal 10 tons of T.N.T. for every man, woman and child on
                        the face of the earth.” was Restricted Data and wanted it removed from the
                        speech. They persisted in this ridiculous position up until the moment
                        before the President went on the air.<note n="9" xml:id="d5fn9">Item 4 in

                            the declassification of the President's statement, with Howard Brown,

                            absence of <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> who was giving
                            a speech in Denver, but the minutes are in <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, Vol. 7, p.
                        258.</note> It is also interesting to note that the President himself, at
                        the last moment, added the “excellent” next to last paragraph referring to
                        the importance of individuals interesting themselves in the problems of arms
                        control.</p>

                    <p>In the week following the Presidential statement, there were a series of
                        meetings and cables aimed at further reassuring our allies.<note n="10" xml:id="d5fn10">Examples of this exchange of cables are Disto 1496 from
                            Geneva, January 24 (Department of State, Central Files, DEF 18) and
                            Todis 1208 to Geneva, January 25. (Ibid.)</note> There appears to be a
                        major effort in some quarters to use this opportunity to establish as large
                        a “safeguards” program with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as
                        possible and tie up possible negotiations with commitments to make future
                        proposals only on a joint <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> basis. I
                        objected to a number of cables on the grounds that they implied positions
                        and commitments that had not been agreed to and managed to tone things down
                        a little.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, the control post proposal ran into anticipated troubles in
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. Finletter and the Germans and
                        French objected to both the schedule and the proposed method of procedure.
                        The Timberlake mission appears to have accomplished little and he has
                        returned to Washington. Finletter asked that the control post proposals be
                        advanced as formal <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> proposals and that
                        all deadlines be removed. I objected to an <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> cable which would have authorized Finletter to agree to handle
                        the control post proposal only as joint <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                        proposal since it should be much easier to get the key members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to go along with a U.S. initiative in
                        this field than to create a formal joint <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> control post proposal. The final instructions, which although
                        weak are acceptable, are attached (see attachment 4). As I understand it,
                        formal discussion of the control post proposal will begin in Paris today but
                        there is no longer any official date by which a decision will be reached.</p>
                    <p>At the end of last week, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> circulated for
                        staff consideration the attached paper setting forth in more detail the
                        basic elements of a production freeze proposal (see attachment 5). This will
                        be considered at a Principals meeting next Monday, 10 February.<note n="11" xml:id="d5fn11">No record of a February 10 meeting of the Committee of

                        <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> also circulated the attached position
                        paper on non-dissemination of nuclear weapons to formalize the changes
                        involved in clearing the Geneva statement (see attachment 6).<note n="12" xml:id="d5fn12">The <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> position paper
                            has not been found. The “Geneva statement” apparently refers to
                                <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s remarks on
                            dissemination, which he made to the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament
                            Committee on February 6; for text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on
                                Disarmament</hi>, 1964, pp. 32-36.</note> This has now been agreed
                        upon.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile in Geneva, the Presidential statement appears to have been well
                        received although <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> has not been
                        able to elaborate on it in much detail. Most of the initial concern has been
                        with what the proposal would not do rather than with what it would do and
                        this does not make very good text for Geneva. The most interesting
                        development in Geneva was probably the discussion of the much anticipated
                        Polish proposal. The Poles are clearly going out of their way to indicate
                        that they are very flexible and I believe that it may eventually be possible
                        to build something <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0048"/>on it. The U.S.
                        response has been non-committal and a series of questions are being posed to
                        clarify the proposal (see attachment 7).<note n="13" xml:id="d5fn13">On
                            December 28, 1963, Polish First Secretary Wladyslaw Gomulka proposed a
                            nuclear freeze in Central Europe. For extracts from his statement, see

                    <p>On Friday, 31 January, at the request of the President, <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> prepared the attached useful summary
                        of actions in the field of disarmament (see attachment 9).</p>
                    <p>Looking into the immediate future, a Deputy Principals meeting is scheduled
                        for 6 February and a Principals meeting for 10 February to consider the
                            <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> paper on the basic elements of the
                        freeze on nuclear vehicles. A second item for consideration is the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal to set up a Verification
                        Advisory Committee (<gloss target="#t_VERAC1">VERAC</gloss>), which you will
                        recall we have discussed with <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> in the past. As I
                        anticipated, this has run into some <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> opposition. With all of
                        the unfinished business before us, I do not really believe the Principals
                        should occupy themselves with this <gloss target="#t_VERAC1">VERAC</gloss>
                        question at this time if there is strong opposition.</p>
                    <p>Looking back over the past two weeks, I conclude that although our present
                        Geneva position is much less impressive than we had hoped, it is a
                        substantial improvement over the one we would have had if you had not given
                        things a strong push the week before you left. I think that the initiatives
                        that have been started, if not allowed to die on the vine, could evolve into
                        some rather interesting and conceivably negotiable proposals.</p>
                    <p>The action or lack of action of the past two weeks present the following
                        immediate problems:</p>
                    <p>(1) Need for agreement within U.S. Government on the basic elements of our
                        proposal for a production freeze so that the Geneva delegation can expound
                        on these ideas at an early date.</p>
                    <p>(2) Prevention of proliferation of “safeguards” for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> prior to any indication of Soviet interest in our present
                        proposals.</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0049"/>
                    <p>(3) Prevention of any commitments to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        limiting our arms control initiatives to formal joint <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> proposals.</p>
                    <p>(4) Need for continued consideration within Government of both strategic and
                        conventional reductions that might be coupled with the production freeze.</p>
                    <p>(5) Need for follow-up action to assure that the control post proposal does
                        not bog down indefinitely in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> debate.</p>
                    <p>(6) Need for careful consideration of the Polish proposals to see if new
                        counter-proposals can be built upon them.</p>

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, represented by Commissioners
                            <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> and Palfrey, first
                        presented its basic justification for the project: It will provide necessary
                            <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0050"/>information concerning cratering
                        and dispersion of radioactive debris. In the view of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> the project is not objectionable under the
                        Treaty on the ground that the risk of detection outside the territorial
                        limits of the United States is minimum.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> questioned the
                        compatibility of the project with the Treaty and indicated that in his view
                        only an event which was intended to be fully contained was permitted under
                        the Treaty.</p>
                    <p>The Defense Department was represented by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH8">Harold Brown</persName> who supported the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> position. I pointed out that there were two aspects involved in
                        the question whether the project violated the Treaty. First, the actual
                        amount of radioactive debris that would travel beyond our borders and,
                        second, the probability that such amount could be detected. There may be a
                        Treaty violation even though no radioactive debris is detected beyond our
                        borders, just as there can be a violation of a speeding limit even though no
                        policeman sees it. On the other hand, we recognize that every underground
                        nuclear explosion, no matter how fully contained, will produce some
                        radioactive debris and that some of that debris will inevitably travel
                        beyond our borders. The Treaty was obviously not intended to preclude all
                        underground explosions. The question of detection is, therefore, a relevant,
                        though not the only, consideration.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Scoville</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> representative, questioned the project
                        both on the ground of the Treaty and also because of the lack of a detailed
                        analysis of future projects.</p>
                    <p>In response to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName>'s question,
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> stated that the project
                        could be delayed until the fall without impairing the Plowshare program if
                        the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> received some indication that the
                        project would probably be actually carried out in the fall.</p>
                    <p>I was asked what the reaction abroad would be if the test turned out to be
                        detectable. In essence I responded that there might well be adverse
                        propaganda but that I doubted whether any nation, including the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, would denounce the Treaty as a result. I
                        also commented upon the domestic-political factors involved in rejecting the
                        project.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> concluded the meeting by
                        stating that he would discuss the matter with Mr. Bundy. There may be a
                        further meeting on the subject. I will be in Europe for the next two weeks
                        but have asked Leonard Meeker to keep in touch with the White House
                        concerning this matter. He will inform you of any further developments.</p>

                    <p>In a telephone call to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> on February 11 at 12:20 p.m., <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> reported on “three small
                        matters,” the first of which had to do with “a project Plowshare peaceful
                        uses experiment which will vent and may be detected in Canada.” Bundy
                        continued, “The recommendation of State and of myself and I'm pretty sure of
                        Bob <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> is that we ought to put
                        this off til after the election. You don't want the Russians accusing you of
                        breaking a treaty. There'll be some fuss in the Commission, but they
                        themselves are not prepared to do it in the grazing season because of the
                        fear of American farmers complaining, which seems to make it clear that
                        we're not quite ready to run these risks. I would prefer to sign the
                        instruction myself and to sign you on it directly, unless you are deeply
                        interested.”</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>: “No, it's all
                        right, if all of you follow the agreement.”</p>
                    <p> Bundy: “Well, as I say, <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> would
                        love to do it, but he's a special interested party, and I think I can cool
                        him off. If I get a tough reaction, I'll come back.” (Johnson Library,

                    <p>In addition, the President requests the Secretary of State, in consultation
                        with other responsible officers of the Government as appropriate, to give
                        immediate consideration to the probabilities and problems involved in
                        obtaining from the nations signatory to the Test Ban Treaty approval for the
                        utilization of nuclear energy for peaceful explosions under adequate
                        international controls. The President requests that a first report on this
                        matter be available to him by the end of March.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> introduced Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, who made the following
                        remarks: the US current efforts in the field of disarmament are to find some
                        next steps toward disarmament which do not require rigorous inspection. The
                        West now has a balanced force of nuclear missiles, land and sea, which is
                        considerably larger than the Soviets. However, the West cannot completely
                        destroy the Soviet missiles in a first strike, so the Soviets have the power
                        to inflict unacceptable damage on the West. Hence, they have the essence of
                        a deterrent. It appears the Soviets believe they have this power. Therefore,
                        a freeze would be to their advantage even as it would be to ours. The
                        verification procedures would be less complicated than with more extensive
                        disarmament measures. They would be applied only at declared testing sites
                        and at production facilities; verification would also involve some checking
                        for clandestine facilities. The categories of delivery systems affected by
                        the freeze would be:</p>
                    <p>a) Intercontinental missiles</p>
                    <p>b) Medium-range missiles</p>
                    <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0053"/>
                    <p>c) Heavy bombers (above 40,000 kilograms)</p>
                    <p>d) Medium bombers (25,000-40,000 kilograms)</p>
                    <p>e) Anti-ballistic missile missiles.</p>
                    <p>It would be possible to maintain and replace missiles on a one-for-one basis
                        and keep confidence in the missiles by some number of firings. There would
                        be no testing of new models. The tactical weapons systems, for instance the
                        Pershing, would not be affected because they lacked the range to reach to
                        the heart of Russia and they were needed in West Germany.</p>
                    <p>The inspection would be simple and agreed. In addition the West would have
                        unilateral monitoring of launch facilities by its own facilities. There
                        would be a withdrawal clause. Other states would join the agreement as their
                        development of nuclear weapons caused them to affect the balance of power.
                        Initially France and Communist China would not need to be included. The
                        Multilateral Force concept would be protected because the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> does not contemplate the national
                        dissemination of control of nuclear weapons. The anti-missile missile would
                        have to be controlled; otherwise there might be a big shift in the balance
                        of power.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> added that the US felt quite
                        sure the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not agree soon to such
                        a program if it were proposed. It would be a miracle if agreement were
                        reached in 1964. This meant that the nuclear production of 1964 would be
                        maintained. Our first step, of course, was to consult our allies regarding
                        this general idea.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> asked whether Polaris were
                        covered.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said yes, that one could
                        not build one after the agreement.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HLWDOG1">Ormsby Gore</persName> said that
                        Britain, for example, could declare 5 Polaris submarines with 16 nuclear
                        missiles apiece and replacements, and this would be the British limit under
                        such an agreement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> thought the idea might be
                        an infringement of Nassau.<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">Reference is to the
                            U.S.-U.K. agreement, concluded at Nassau on December 21, 1962, on
                            nuclear defense systems. For a joint U.S.-U.K. statement issued on that

                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said no because the
                        British program would be provided for under the agreement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> asked what was the Soviet
                        reaction.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> said it was too early to
                        say. He thought such a program was too big a bite for the Soviets to take
                        now; they probably want to make haste slowly.</p>
                    <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0054"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out that the
                        British did not have production in several of the five categories that would
                        be frozen. The program was devised to exclude from control the British TSR-2
                        and the US TFX.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName>, turning to a new subject,
                        said he was thinking of advocating publicly asymmetrical reductions in
                        armaments, including a balancing in some way conventional and nuclear
                        forces. He also wondered about the details of the proposed destruction of
                        out-moded nuclear delivery systems.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> thought that the effort
                        to work out a reasonable relationship between conventional and nuclear
                        forces was too complicated to be realistic or helpful. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said, for example, what is one million
                        civilians; are they potential soldiers?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> surmised that the US would
                        prefer that he not raise the idea of asymmetry in disarmament. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he would prefer to have Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> emphasize the prime
                        importance of making sure that arms production curve does not soar upwards.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> asked whether it was still
                        fashionable to have a Badger-B-47 bonfire. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said, yes, if they do not have much value and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> pointed out the value of
                        keeping such obsolescent weapons from falling into the hands of, for
                        example, the Egyptians or the Indians. He agreed with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HLWDOG1">Ormsby Gore</persName> that other kinds of weapons
                        might be proposed for the bonfire. He said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had asked him whether other weapons than the
                        B-47-Badger could be destroyed and that the reply had been that the US would
                        be glad to consider further suggestions.</p>
                    <p>In point of fact, the first important step was the freeze on manufacture of
                        new weapons, but, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> concluded,
                        it might prove possible later on to throw into the bonfire more than merely
                        out-moded weapons.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> at Geneva might not also consider
                        saying something publicly about arms races other than that of the US and
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> versus the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. For instance, the Arab-Israeli arms race, the
                        Indian-Pakistan, the arms acquisition of African states all served to
                        jeopardize the peace and to impoverish nations already very poor.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> thought that the expose of
                        this subject had been most helpful and thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. He said that the British had
                        been making the right noises in their public statements in Geneva and that
                        they would continue doing so. He recognized that the major responsibility
                        was that of the US since the US had so much larger and more varied an arms
                        production.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> reviewed current US
                        thinking on disarmament for the Prime Minister. He referred to the
                        categories of missiles and delivery systems which the US thought could be
                        banned from further production under a carefully devised formula with a
                        minimum of inspection. These included intercontinental missiles, heaviest
                        bombers, medium bombers of 25,000 kilograms, anti-missile missiles. In the
                        meantime, the Secretary thought that it might be helpful if the British
                        wished to contribute something to the “bonfire” of Badgers and B-47's. He
                        suggested that the British could discuss aspects of disarmament privately
                        with the French. The French government was interested in non-dissemination
                        of nuclear weapons, he said, though it was not interested in a Multilateral
                        Force. It might be possible for the French to tell the Russians that in the
                        French opinion MLF does not constitute dissemination of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Alex</persName> asked whether the categories
                        of weapons and delivery systems where production might be halted excluded
                        all tactical nuclear weapons. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        said they would not be included; that the US was <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0056"/>now in the process of re-equipping its allies with smaller
                        but more effective weapons of this sort. Mr. Bundy pointed out that
                        thousands of them are in existence and are hard to inspect.</p>
                    <p>Sir Alec wanted to know why the Russians would want to agree on a strategical
                        hold-down. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> referred to these
                        advantages: a) the expense, which the Russians could spare themselves
                        (developing an anti-missile missile might cost $14 billion); b) the Russians
                        have a deterrent now.</p>
                    <p>The British Ambassador remarked that in fact the Russians to date have not
                        shown much interest in the idea of limiting production of various
                        categories. </p>
                    <p>Sir Alec inquired whether if the bomber production were stopped, it would be
                        stated that the Polaris production continues as a replacement of the bomber.
                        Mr. Bundy thought that the rationale would be different. The US would agree
                        to a freeze on terms which would allow it to honor its agreement at Nassau
                        and with regard to <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. Furthermore, the
                        freeze would permit confidence firings and this would mean a one-for-one
                        replacement of such missiles. </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> indicated that some
                        specifications might be made which would allow, for example, Polaris
                        submarines on the way but not built to be completed. He felt sure that such
                        a plan, in any case, would not become a reality for a considerable period of
                        time, almost certainly not in 1964.</p>
                    <p>Sir Alec asked whether the Soviets were interested in comprehensive and
                        general disarmament. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        thought they had no interest at the present time. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Bundy said that the immediate problem is to make use of and yet control
                        underground testing in the light of the partial test ban. There is also the
                        problem of the peace time use of nuclear power. These issues would not be
                        acute, he thought, this year, but they would be in 1965 and the years to
                        come.</p>

                    <p>Because of budgetary constraints, the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>
                        developed possible schedules for power reductions at its gaseous diffusion
                        plants, which in turn would result in further reductions in the production
                        of <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 beyond the 25 percent cut President
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> announced on January 8,
                        1964. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> outlined the
                        alternatives in a February 11 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, which is reproduced in <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>,
                        Volume 7, pages 363-365.</p>

                        Tape</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PJG2">John G. Palfrey</persName>
                        on February 12, the conferees agreed to a schedule for reducing power and
                            <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 production. They further agreed to
                        announce these reductions by February 15 because “a long delay on this
                        matter would cost on the order of $16 million in penalty payments” to the
                        utilities, which required long advance notice of power cutbacks. When Bundy
                        asked Thompson whether there would be any value in delaying this decision in
                        order to use this possibility of a cutback in the current disarmament
                        negotiations with the Russians, Thompson said that “it wouldn't be worth the
                        cost of delay on the basis of the slight hopes that the Russians would go
                        along with mutual reductions in production.” It was further decided that
                            <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> would write a letter to
                        the President recommending these actions. (Ibid., pages 373 and 382)</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>'s February 13 letter, which
                        did not mention the possible disarmament implications, is reproduced ibid.,
                        page 383. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> cleared this
                        letter on the telephone subject to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s concurrence, but the disarmament people at State and
                            <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> apparently demurred. (Ibid., pages
                        386 and 392) In his memorandum to Bundy, February 14, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> Acting Director <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> argued that a premature announcement
                        of the pending additional reduction in U.S. production of U-235 would
                        undercut the President's earlier call for the Soviets to respond to the
                        earlier U.S. cutback and to accept some inspection, and he proposed first
                        “that an effort be made to elicit a favorable Soviet response.” <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>'s memorandum is reproduced ibid.,
                        pages 393-394. Bundy agreed to go ahead with a message to the Soviet
                        leadership and to defer the announcement of the cutback until April 20.

                    <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>With further reference to my announcement of January eighth of the reduction
                        by twenty-five percent in the United States output of enriched uranium
                            (<gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235) and the closing of some
                        plutonium-producing reactors,<note n="2" xml:id="d11fn2">See <ref target="#d1">Document 1</ref>.</note> I have again reviewed our
                        requirements and have concluded that it will soon be possible to reduce
                        United States production of <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 by an
                        additional substantial amount.</p>
                    <p>I am furnishing you this advance notice in the renewed hope that the Soviet
                        Government would find it in its interest to take a parallel step. </p>
                    <p>It seems to me that this is an area in which our two Governments could put
                        into practice the concept of “mutual example” which you have suggested.<note n="3" xml:id="d11fn3">The quoted phrase has not been further
                        identified.</note> The reductions need not be by an equal amount. I am sure
                        that another substantial reduction in United States output will naturally
                        lead the world to hope that the Soviet Union will follow suit. I would hope
                        that your Government would also be prepared to join the United States in
                        taking such action as would confirm to the world that we were in fact taking
                        these steps; I have already offered to take action of this type with respect
                        to one of the reactors we are shutting down.</p>
                    <p>Should my suggestion meet your approval, I am prepared to delay my
                        announcement of a further United States reduction for the time it would
                        require to concert our views on the matter. We could then consider <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0059"/>how best to make this public, whether
                        by a joint announcement or other appropriate means. You will have noticed
                        that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has announced the cessation of
                        production of U-235 for military purposes,<note n="4" xml:id="d11fn4">Included in the British Defense White Paper, issued February 13, was a
                            statement that sufficient supplies of fissile material were already
                            available and that therefore production of U-235 for military purposes
                            had ceased at Capenhurst in 1963 and military plutonium production was
                            gradually being terminated. (Keesing's <hi rend="italic">Contemporary
                                Archives</hi>, 1963-1964, p. 19978)</note> and I would hope that the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would want to join in any discussions
                        we have.</p>
                    <p>I sincerely believe that both our Governments would stand to gain by such

                        Chiefs of Staff forwarded a preliminary analysis of the national security
                        implications <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0060"/>inherent in a “verified
                        freeze” of the number and characteristics of strategic nuclear offensive and
                        defensive vehicles. That study served to focus attention on the many complex
                        problems involved in defining and subsequently negotiating the basic
                        elements of an acceptable freeze agreement. The Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        concluded from the preliminary analysis that there was real doubt whether
                        practical solutions could be found to some of the problems. One of the
                        principal areas of doubt was the negotiability of the type of verification
                        system that would be adequate to provide necessary assurance of compliance
                        with the provisions of an agreement. Certainly such a system would be
                        intrusive to a greater extent than the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        has been willing to consider in the past. However, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        recognize that many benefits would accrue if a breakthrough could be made in
                        opening up the Soviet Union to the level of inspection deemed necessary. On
                        the other hand, they also note that if, through the negotiation process, the
                        position of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on adequate verification were
                        substantially eroded, national security could be adversely affected.</p>
                    <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> paper would apparently place
                        major reliance on US intelligence to verify a freeze agreement. In
                        particular, no provisions are made for aerial surveillance and unscheduled
                        on-site inspections, other than of production facilities, at the option of
                        the United States. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that the verification
                        system negotiated should be completely sufficient within itself to assure
                        compliance with an agreement. US intelligence, on the other hand, should
                        only be relied upon to validate any list of installations, to cross check
                        information and data obtained from the inspection system, and to establish
                        priority for the type and area of inspection. Any other role could result in
                        either a compromise of US intelligence sources with degradation of US
                        intelligence capability or in an inability positively to confirm suspected
                        violations. The latter case would tend to negate the tension-reducing
                        objectives of the agreement by creating situations whereby legitimate
                        suspicions could not be definitely allayed. Thus, before a US position paper
                        on verification can be formulated, the foregoing role of US intelligence in
                        the verification process must be accepted.</p>
                    <p>4. In addition to the freeze on the number and characteristics of strategic
                        nuclear offensive and defensive vehicles, the preliminary analysis by the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded that consideration should also be given to
                        including other items under the freeze, such as launchers and fissionable
                        material production. Accordingly, the attached Appendix<note n="4" xml:id="d12fn4">Not printed.</note> has been prepared consistent with
                        the inclusion of these items and compatible with the view expressed above on
                        the role of US intelligence.</p>

                    <p>5. In view of the fundamental nature of the comments provided in the
                        Appendix, a detailed review of the verification portion of the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> paper is not appropriate until basic
                        differences are resolved and the paper has been redrafted. It is recommended
                        that the views expressed in the Appendix be incorporated in the redraft and
                        that such redraft be referred to the Joint Chiefs of Staff for review.</p>

                    <p>At the Secretary's request, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> came in this afternoon to discuss disarmament matters.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary opened the conversation by explaining that he had mentioned
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s visit at his
                        just-concluded press conference<note n="2" xml:id="d13fn2">Text in

                        have created an undesirable air of mystery.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary mentioned that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s return from Geneva did not indicate any lessened
                        American interest in disarmament and stressed that we must keep trying to
                        reach agreement.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary also mentioned seeing today for the first time an indication
                        that the Soviet Government is supporting the Polish proposal for a nuclear
                        freeze in Central Europe.<note n="3" xml:id="d13fn3">Reference presumably is
                            to a February 24 memorandum from the Government of Poland on freezing
                            nuclear weapons in Central Europe, which was transmitted to interested
                            governments through diplomatic channels. Text in <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1964</hi>, pp. 53-55. The first
                            indication of Soviet support for the Polish proposal has not been
                            further identified.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> indicated that his
                        Government would support the Polish plan but, in response to the Secretary's
                        question, said he did not know when full details of the plan would be
                        available. The Secretary said that we will take a good look at the plan when
                        the details are available.</p>
                    <p rend="center">MLF AND NON-DISSEMINATION</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then turned to the subject of the Multilateral Force (<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>) and non-dissemination of nuclear weapons,
                        saying that this was an informal conversation and not a
                        government-to-government representation. The Secretary stated that he wished
                        clarification of one aspect of this subject. He desired to know whether the
                        Soviet objection to <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is that the Soviet
                        Government believes <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would mean
                        dissemination of nuclear weapons or whether the Soviet Government has
                        additional or different objections. He said that if the Soviet objection is
                        merely the former, we believe that we can eventually reassure the Soviet
                        Government on this point. After <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had said that the U.S.S.R. is opposed primarily to
                        dissemination, the Secretary asked further whether the Soviet Government was
                        concerned primarily about the possible dissemination of nuclear weapons to
                        Germany or whether it was more generally concerned about dissemination to
                        any country. Without answering the question in specific terms, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> indicated that the U.S.S.R. is
                        concerned about the dissemination of nuclear weapons to Germany but was also
                        concerned about dissemination of these weapons to any country.</p>
                    <p>At this point the Secretary mentioned that the primary U.S. concern in this
                        field is Communist China and asked whether the Soviet Government had any
                        indication whatsoever whether Peiping would be interested in a
                        non-dissemination treaty. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        said he had no information and would not guess but stressed that we (the
                        U.S. and U.S.S.R.) should not lose interest in non-dissemination in any
                        case.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary agreed and stated that he hopes we can keep the issue of
                        non-dissemination open, adding that we know the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> will not give <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0063"/>nuclear
                        weapons to Germany; that the safeguards are not merely legal but also apply
                        to the physical arrangements; that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        safeguards will be even stronger than those currently in force among <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners. He asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> whether, if the U.S. can satisfy
                        the U.S.S.R. on this point, the Soviet Government had other objections to
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. He mentioned as an example that the
                        U.S.S.R. might be concerned that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would
                        add the financial and economic resources of other countries to the
                        production and deployment of nuclear weapons capability. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> responded that the Soviet side
                        believes that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> means dissemination, that
                        the Soviet Government understands the U.S. position but does not agree with
                        it, that the Soviet Government is concerned that Germany, and also other
                        countries, will get nuclear weapons through <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that if this is the specific point of Soviet objection, it
                        is important to keep the discussion of non-dissemination open because the
                        Soviet Government will discover that the Germans will not get nuclear
                        weapons through <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if he could summarize
                        the Secretary's position as follows: The U.S. believes in the desirability
                        of non-dissemination but is going ahead on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and will later try to convince the Soviet Government by the
                        actual <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> arrangements that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> will not mean dissemination. The Secretary
                        said there was one more point—that he had asked whether the Soviet
                        objections to <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> were concentrated on
                        dissemination or on other questions. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that the question of other objections had not
                        arisen because the Soviet Government was concerned about dissemination. The
                        Secretary repeated that in this event it is important to keep the discussion
                        of non-dissemination open because the U.S. will eventually be able to show
                        the U.S.S.R. that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> will not mean the
                        dissemination of nuclear weapons to Germany and others.</p>
                    <p rend="center">MILITARY BUDGETS</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the Soviet Government had made proposals for a mutual
                        reduction of defense budgets and that the U.S. had responded by suggesting
                        technical talks on this subject. He indicated that the U.S. is concerned
                        that the Soviet and American military budgets are so different that it would
                        be impossible to make percentage reductions which would be meaningful. He
                        pointed out that the U.S. defense budget contains more items than the Soviet
                        defense budget and suggested that the U.S. defense budget expert, Mr.
                        Charles Hitch,<note n="4" xml:id="d13fn4">Assistant Secretary of Defense
                            (Comptroller).</note> talk to his Soviet counterpart to obtain a proper
                        comparison in military budgets. He added that when he had discussed this
                        subject with Gromyko the latter had neither agreed nor disagreed and the
                        Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> to sound out
                        his Government as to whether we could have such a discussion of experts.</p>
                    <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0064"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the Soviet side and he
                        personally felt that such a discussion would do no good, that if the U.S.
                        doesn't trust the U.S.S.R. now, no details would ever satisfy the U.S. The
                        discussion passed back and forth on this question, the Secretary reiterating
                        the need for further information and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> arguing in favor of an immediate percentage cut in
                        budgets. When <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked why,
                        since the U.S. favored cuts by mutual example, it could not accept cuts by
                        agreement, the Secretary replied that by an agreement the U.S. would be
                        giving up its freedom of movement. He also said that, since the Soviet
                        defense budget is more narrow than ours, a percentage reduction would mean
                        less of a reduction for the U.S.S.R. than for the U.S.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that when the U.S.
                        announced a reduction in its defense budget, it did not say exactly what it
                        was reducing. He added that the U.S.S.R. was prepared to do this same sort
                        of thing. He continued that another committee to study defense budgets would
                        get nowhere. It would take years of discussion and the U.S. would want to
                        look at the defense budgets of all the Soviet ministries.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that he thought a policy of mutual example was best,
                        but the U.S.S.R. was pressing for a percentage reduction at Geneva.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> claimed the U.S.S.R. had set
                        a good example but said he felt an agreement was better than mutual example.
                        He added that the U.S. had intelligence means to discover whether the
                        U.S.S.R. carried out its agreement. He concluded by saying that without some
                        such technical discussion of military budgets he did not see how the U.S.
                        could agree to a percentage reduction of military budgets, since it would be
                        giving up its freedom of action for something unknown.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        agreed that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> would tell the
                        press that they had discussed a number of disarmament matters.</p>

                    <p>At 11 a.m. I attended a meeting of the Principals in the Secretary of State's
                        Conference Room. Present were <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>,

                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> opened the meeting by asking
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> to give a summary of the
                        negotiations at Geneva. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said
                        that these had been conducted in the best atmosphere yet. There had been no
                        agreement, not even on the agenda. The Soviets are insisting on reductions
                        in the military budgets, but we are resisting this since there is no way of
                        verifying such reductions. The Soviets emphasize the election year aspects
                        of the U.S. reductions. The Soviets are proposing a 20% reduction in
                        military budgets, with the savings to be contributed to the welfare of
                        developing countries. The Soviets have given no answer to our proposal for
                        the destruction of bombers.<note n="2" xml:id="d14fn2">The U.S. and Soviet
                            Governments had earlier discussed the destruction of bombers informally,
                            but the U.S. position was not formally presented until <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> introduced it in the

                        of fissionable materials, he says privately that the U.S. already has too

                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he talked to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> yesterday, not about observation
                        posts, as the newspapers reported, but about the possibility of the Soviets
                        letting Charlie Hitch talk to their “Hitch,” but they refused.<note n="3" xml:id="d14fn3">Regarding this conversation, see <ref target="#d13">Document 13</ref>.</note> They say that the policy of mutual
                        example is best, but <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that
                        the U.S. couldn't agree to this without a lot of verification. It was
                        suggested that <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> go into this
                        further. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> hinted at some Soviet withdrawals

                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> continued that today's issue is
                        the freeze on delivery vehicles and that we should get our position in line.
                        We needn't disclose any details in the early negotiations. The Soviets
                        haven't disclosed any position on this as yet. He said he appreciated the

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I have studied your oral message delivered on February twenty-second through
                        our Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2">
                            <ref target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.</note> In that message you raise
                        the question that our two countries should agree on and put forward a joint
                        declaration of, or make public in some other appropriate way, their
                        intention to cut production of fissionable materials for military purposes.
                        You express the view that this would have an encouraging effect on world
                        public opinion and that it would give new impetus to the talks on
                        disarmament.</p>
                    <p>I want to tell you at once in this connection that we, naturally, are ready
                        to explore jointly all ways, to use all opportunities that might lead to an
                        improvement of the international situation and to the strengthening of trust
                        among states and that might facilitate progress in the disarmament
                        negotiations. The Soviet Government firmly holds the view that to this end
                        now certain preconditions have developed in the world. The conclusion of the
                        treaty banning nuclear tests in the atmosphere, outer space and underwater
                        and after it the understanding that has been <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0068"/>reached on not putting into orbit objects with nuclear
                        weapons aboard,<note n="3" xml:id="d15fn3">Reference apparently is to U.N.
                            General Assembly Resolution 1884 (XVIII), adopted by acclamation on
                            October 18, 1963, in which all nations were called upon to refrain from
                            stationing in outer space or placing in orbit objects carrying nuclear
                            weapons or other weapons of mass destruction. Text in <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1963</hi>, p. 538.</note> as is now being
                        widely recognized, have helped clear somewhat the international horizon. We
                        were also able to reach mutual understanding on the question of some
                        reduction of military budgets.<note n="4" xml:id="d15fn4">An apparent
                            reference to parallel reductions of military budgets in the Soviet Union
                            and the United States.</note> Now it is necessary to proceed further and
                        to try to reach an understanding on further steps directed at reducing the
                        arms race and at creating increasingly favorable conditions for solving the
                        cardinal problem—that of general and complete disarmament.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government has expressed in the Eighteen Nation Committee among
                        other places, its considerations with regard to those measures which we
                        believe desirable to undertake in this direction. You know, of course, our
                        position—we propose to agree on the withdrawal of foreign troops from the
                        territories of others or, by way of beginning, on the reduction of the
                        numerical strength of such forces, on the further reduction of military
                        budgets, on the signing of a nonaggression pact between the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries and the Warsaw Treaty states,
                        on preventing further proliferation of nuclear weapons, on the creation of
                        nuclear-free zones in various parts of the world and so on. We are convinced
                        that these are both the most effective, from the standpoint of reducing
                        international tension, and the most realistic measures in present
                        conditions.</p>
                    <p>However, we gave our full attention to the suggestion set forth in your
                        message, that an understanding be reached on a certain reduction of the
                        production of fissionable materials for military purposes. After thinking it
                        over and consulting our specialists I come to the conclusion that it may be
                        worthwhile to try to seek a mutual understanding in this area also.</p>
                    <p>Of course, as I understand it, you yourself proceed from the assumption that
                        a reduction of the production of fissionable materials for military purposes
                        does not represent any step forward in terms of actual disarmament. Indeed,
                        in this case neither nuclear weapons stockpiled by the states are to be
                        destroyed nor is even further stockpiling to be stopped.</p>
                    <p>I shall confide that our specialists have also drawn my attention to the
                        numerous remarks in the American press as well as to the statements of some
                        of your officials to the effect that for two decades the United States has
                        accumulated a quantity of fissionable materials, which in general exceeds
                        all thinkable and even unthinkable requirements for the production of
                        nuclear weapons. If this is really true, it means that a kind <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0069"/>of a crisis of overproduction is about to
                        happen in the field of fissionable materials in the United States.</p>
                    <p>But no matter what the situation is, I admit that the very fact of agreement
                        between our countries about the reduction of production of fissionable
                        materials for military purposes can have positive significance as evidence
                        of our intention to take the way not of further increasing the nuclear
                        weapons race but to go along the way of its gradual slowdown. It is
                        precisely on this basis that we are saying that we are ready to search for
                        such agreement.</p>
                    <p>You express the opinion that in this field we could take practical steps in
                        accordance with the concept of “mutual example.” I agree with you in this
                        respect. Reducing production of fissionable materials for military purposes
                        is the very field where apparently it is easier to act on the basis of
                        “mutual example.” But then it is necessary of course to seek sincerely an
                        actual reduction of production of fissionable materials since this involves
                        national security and each side takes a certain risk. What good could come
                        out, for example, if one of the sides took the path of closing some
                        enterprises producing fissionable materials while at the same time put into
                        operation others and more powerful at that?</p>
                    <p>If we have mutual understanding concerning the necessity of a wholly sincere
                        approach by both sides to the question of reducing production of fissionable
                        materials for military purposes and taking into consideration all actually
                        existing circumstances, then I think we could come to agreement. I, for
                        example, even now could inform you that the Soviet Government would be
                        prepared to announce the ending of the construction of two new large
                        reactors for the production of plutonium. However, our specialists have
                        informed me that the United States, having adopted a decision to stop four
                        old plutonium reactors of low power, at the same time is starting a new
                        reactor <gloss target="#t_NPR1">NPR</gloss> in Hanford, which has more than
                        twice as much power as all four reactors to be stopped taken together.</p>
                    <p>Now as for a reduction of the production of uranium-235. Here, too, certain
                        circumstances should be taken into account. For instance, you refer to the
                        announcement of the British Government concerning the ending of the
                        production of uranium-235 for military purposes. It is no secret however
                        that at the same time new large plutonium plants are being put into
                        operation in England. And in France after the forthcoming starting of a
                        large gas-diffusion plant in Pierrelatte, the production of uranium-235 as
                        reported will reach one-fourth of the American level. All this will more
                        than compensate for the stopping of the production of uranium-235 for
                        military purposes at a small plant in England.</p>
                    <p>I consider it necessary to draw your attention to all this because it is
                        already important to avoid now any reservations which in the future could
                        lead to misunderstandings and to complications that would damage <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0070"/>mutual confidence. Your words that the
                        reductions of the production of fissionable materials for military purposes
                        need not be by an equal amount I interpret as an indication that you too
                        take this into account.</p>
                    <p>So, let us try. If it turns out that a possibility really exists to take
                        agreed steps in the field of the reduction of the production of fissionable
                        materials for military purposes then there might also become more
                        practicable such prospects as the extension of the transfer for peaceful use
                        of such materials out of current production or of accumulated stockpiles.
                        And this would give a considerable impetus to the development of
                        international cooperation in the field of peaceful application of the energy
                        of the atomic nucleus including the implementation of large projects for
                        instance in the field of desalinization of sea water which a number of
                        states need so badly. But let us not forestall events.</p>
                    <p>You suggest that the British Government should also be drawn in our
                        discussions. We have no objection to this.</p>
                    <p>H ere, Mr. President, are considerations which came to my mind with regard to
                        your oral message of February twenty-second. In transmitting this message to
                        our Ambassador a wish was expressed that the exchange of views on this
                        question as before be of a confidential nature. I agree with this.</p>

                            February 10, 1964, pp. 190-195.</note> that Secretary was now
                        considerably less sanguine as to prospects of reducing world tensions than
                        he had been last summer in Moscow after signature Test Ban Treaty and even
                        last fall in talks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        during the General Assembly. I pointed out that obviously Secretary in major
                        speech on foreign policy must inevitably react to world developments and
                        Soviets own behavior in giving his assessment of detente prospects. Thus the
                        Secretary was obliged to take into account recent TASS statement with regard
                        to Vietnam,<note n="4" xml:id="d16fn4">Not further identified.</note>
                        certain unfounded Soviet press allegations with regard to use of chemical
                        warfare by US forces, and failure of Sovs play more vigorous co-chairman
                        role on Laos problem. Nonetheless, it was clear from Secretary's speech that
                        he intended to continue search for avenues to agreement in order reduce
                        world tensions. The Secretary obviously had not forsaken his belief that the
                        Test Ban Treaty was a good start on which to build, but he felt the world
                        should not be deluded into thinking that this was any more than an initial
                        step. There was still a long way to go before we could be sure the world had
                        ceased to be a dangerous place in which to live. I knew from personal
                        knowledge that the Secretary hopes that among the many items now on <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> agenda, we would find it possible to
                        agree on further partial measures which would constitute useful sequel to
                        Test Ban Treaty in our mutual efforts to reduce tensions. I understood
                        Secretary had discussed problem with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> yesterday, although I was not yet informed of
                            details.<note n="5" xml:id="d16fn5">See <ref target="#d13">Document
                            13</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Despite my remarks <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he
                        could not avoid feeling the Secretary was less positive now in his approach
                        than last year. He agreed, of course, that proper approach was to single out
                        partial measures on which we could agree and in this connection he felt the
                        Soviet proposal <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0072"/>for destruction of
                        all bombers was ideally suited. Proposal, in <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s view, sufficiently limited to avoid impairing
                        present balance of forces and at same time radical enough to impress world.</p>
                    <p>I said that we had hoped to find common interest in measure of this type, but
                        we feared that radical extension of proposal by Sovs to cover all bombers
                        might in fact result in killing off chances for agreement. Best approach, in
                        our view, was to agree now on limited step of B-47-Badger destruction in
                        order not to upset balance of forces—<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> for
                        example relies exclusively on bomber force—and perhaps ultimately reach
                        understanding on destruction of all bombers.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that perhaps compromise
                        could be reached under which we might agree on general policy of destroying
                        all bombers and in implementing this policy decide on one or two particular
                        types for initial destruction. In his view, it would be difficult to
                        convince world that this genuine disarmament measure if agreement confined
                        only to destruction obsolete weapons. Important thing was to agree in
                        principle; question of timing, he was sure, could be worked out to
                        satisfaction both sides.</p>

                        U-235 production was possible, and I indicated that another month or two
                        could certainly be arranged. <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>
                        suggested that a copy of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> message be given to the U.K. Bundy and <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> thought we should decide our own

                            oral message of March 9 (<ref target="#d18">Document 18</ref>)
                            eliminates the following sentence from the March 3 draft: “I have been
                            assured by Her Majesty's Government that no expansion of plutonium
                            production capacity for weapons is in fact being undertaken.” For
                            further U.S.-U.K. discussions of this question, see <ref target="#d20">Document 20</ref>.</note> Bundy raised the question of whether the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPR1">NPR</gloss> produces weapons grade plutonium, or
                        whether it could be said that this production was all for peaceful uses.</p>
                    <p>I said that it is contemplated that a substantial fraction of its output
                        would be used for weapons grade plutonium. Bundy mentioned that the
                        President had some doubts as to the future value of the <gloss target="#t_NPR1">NPR</gloss>. There was further discussion as to the
                        possibility of the <gloss target="#t_NPR1">NPR</gloss>'s being devoted
                        exclusively to the production of plutonium for use as fuel for civilian
                        power, with the implication that this might be explored further.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> pointed out that, with
                        respect to possible cuts by the Soviets on the production of enriched <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235, this could be monitored by the power input
                        in the gaseous diffusion plants. Bundy said he thought that we should think
                        about the possibility of coupling the announcement of the cutback in Soviet
                        plutonium production, mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, with the announcement of a further cutback of U.S.
                        production of enriched <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235.</p>
                    <p>There ensued discussion of the type of reply that should be prepared for the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> message, and it was
                        agreed that <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Scoville</persName>, Chamberlain and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KSMJ1">Keeny</persName> should draft such a
                        message. This message would include an explanation that the cut in plutonium
                        production through the shutdown of four reactors would much more than
                        counter-balance the increase in production due to the start up of the <gloss target="#t_NPR1">NPR</gloss>; in fact, it was felt that it might be best
                        to say that the <gloss target="#t_NPR1">NPR</gloss> production is only about
                        one-half that corresponding to the shutdown of the four reactors. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> felt that this might be included in
                        the letter to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> because they
                        already very likely know our production rates.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the letter should reiterate the value of inspection in
                        connection with cutbacks. It was agreed that when a draft of the letter <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0074"/>was available, it would be checked
                        with me. I identified the dilemma of whether any joint announcement with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be based, from the
                        standpoint of the U.S., on the rationale that the U.S. was cutting back
                        production because it had more fissionable material than it needed, or on
                        the rationale that we were cutting back production in concert with the
                        Soviets (which presents the difficulty of appearing that we are entering
                        into an arrangement without provisions for inspection). (Attached is a copy
                        of the draft reply to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>.)<note n="5" xml:id="d17fn5">Dated March 3.

                    <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>I have received your oral message of February 28<note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2">
                            <ref target="#d15">Document 15</ref>.</note> in answer to a similar
                        message of mine of February 22<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">
                            <ref target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.</note> and I am pleased that you
                        agree with me on the desirability of concurrent action in the area of the
                        reduction of production of fissionable materials. I am particularly
                        gratified to <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0075"/>learn of your decision
                        that the Soviet Government is prepared to announce the ending of the
                        construction of two new large reactors for the production of plutonium.</p>
                    <p>In your letter you raise some question on the announced U.S. reduction in
                        plutonium production since your specialists have informed you that the new
                            <gloss target="#t_NPR1">NPR</gloss> reactor at Hanford would have twice
                        as much power as all four of the reactors which are being shut down. On the
                        contrary, our cutback in plutonium production is actually very much greater
                        than your specialists have stated. The new <gloss target="#t_NPR1">NPR</gloss> will have very much less power than the total power of the four
                        reactors in question. Perhaps this misunderstanding on the part of your
                        specialists arose from the fact that the power levels of the four reactors
                        being shut down have been increased several-fold over their original design
                        levels. Moreover, it is our plan to operate the <gloss target="#t_NPR1">NPR</gloss> reactor, which will be used to produce civilian electric power,
                        in such a manner that a substantial portion of the plutonium produced will
                        not be used for weapons but for the development of breeder piles for the
                        peaceful civilian power program.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, as I previously stated, I do not believe that the reductions in
                        production of fissionable materials by our two countries need be by an equal
                        amount. Therefore, I believe that your proposed halting the construction of
                        two new reactors would serve as an appropriate step on your part to parallel
                        the closing down of the four U.S. reactors.</p>
                    <p>As I informed you in my oral message of February 22, the U.S. also proposes
                        to undertake additional substantial reductions in the production of Uranium
                        235. Specifically, we plan to cut back the production of Uranium 235 by
                        another twenty-five percent in addition to the reduction of twenty-five
                        percent that I announced in January of this year. This additional cutback
                        will be implemented in an orderly fashion over the next few years.</p>
                    <p>In your reply no specific reference is made to parallel Soviet reductions in
                        the production of Uranium 235, but your message implies that you have such
                        actions under consideration. I think that this would be particularly
                        appropriate since it is our understanding that you are continuing to expand
                        your already substantial Uranium 235 production capacity. I am therefore
                        looking forward to learning of any reductions or curtailment that you might
                        have planned in this area which might be considered as a counterpart of the
                        U.S. reductions.</p>
                    <p>You have called attention to the starting up of the French gaseous diffusion
                        plant at Pierrelatte and indicate that it has been reported to have a
                        capacity of one-fourth the American level. We are convinced that this report
                        is incorrect and that the proposed production of the French Uranium 235
                        plant is a much smaller fraction of either the U.S. or the U.S.S.R.
                        capacity. Therefore, I do not believe that this activity on the part of the
                        French should preclude a decision on your part to reduce Uranium 235
                        production or plant expansion.</p>
                    <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0076"/>
                    <p>The United Kingdom has also announced that it has stopped the output of
                        Uranium 235 for weapons purposes and is gradually bringing to an end the
                        production of plutonium for weapons use. This is in contrast with your
                        concern that new plutonium plants were being put into operation in England.
                        I am taking this up with the British Prime Minister and I feel sure that he
                        would be prepared at the right time to amplify the recent announcement about
                        United Kingdom reductions as a part of a concurrent action by our three
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>In your message you raise serious questions about the accuracy and nature of
                        the proposed reductions in fissionable materials production programs. I can
                        appreciate these misunderstandings since all of these programs have been
                        conducted in a highly secure manner. Precisely for this reason, I should
                        like to reaffirm my previous suggestion on the desirability of some type of
                        verification to confirm the nature of the cutbacks being carried out by our
                        countries. I am sure that mutually satisfactory arrangements could be
                        devised so as not to involve unreasonable intrusion. For example, simple
                        observation of some facilities could confirm they were shut down. If such
                        verification could be arranged, I feel that it would add measurable to the
                        confidence of all peoples in the reality of our reductions. Moreover, this
                        verification would provide invaluable experience for the development of
                        verification procedures that must accompany any agreement on the cut-off of
                        fissionable material production for use in weapons.</p>
                    <p>In any case, I believe that we should try to make our announcements on
                        plutonium and Uranium 235 reductions as soon as possible. I also note with
                        pleasure your suggestion that we move on from these initial steps to other
                        measures which would involve actual transfers to peaceful uses of
                        substantial quantities of fissionable materials out of current production or
                        accumulated stockpiles. The U.S. has made numerous offers to transfer large
                        quantities of fissionable material to peaceful uses, and I look forward to
                        further exchanges of view on this subject in the near future. I also share
                        your interest in the possibilities of increased applications of nuclear
                        energy to the welfare of the peoples of the world and would welcome further
                        discussions on possible cooperative projects such as the desalinization of
                        sea water.</p>
                    <p>I shall look forward to hearing from you in the near future on your overall
                        program of reductions or curtailments which would parallel the planned
                        U.S.-U.K. reductions. I propose that we prepare and exchange independent
                        announcements of our intended actions for concurrent release. I believe that
                        the proposed parallel actions will provide a good illustration of what you
                        have called a policy of mutual example.</p>

                    <p>Dear Bob,</p>
                    <p>I have received comments from members of the Committee of Principals on the
                        29 February draft policy paper pertinent to the “Basic Elements of a
                        Verified Freeze of Strategic Delivery Vehicles.”<note n="2" xml:id="d19fn2">The draft policy paper was transmitted under cover of a February 29

                            (Ibid.)</note> to the extent they conform to my understanding of the
                        agreements reached by the Committee of Principals last February 28.<note n="4" xml:id="d19fn4">For notes of the February 28 meeting, see <ref target="#d14">Document 14</ref>.</note> This latest draft has been
                        circulated to each of the members.</p>
                    <p>From the comments made by you and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> on
                        the earlier draft, there are three areas where negotiating tactics seem to
                        be unnecessarily entwined with basic policy.</p>
                    <p>1. With regard to the question of linking a possible “freeze” proposal with a
                        possible “cut-off” proposal, I have studied the extensive treatment of this
                        subject by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>s 128-64<note n="5" xml:id="d19fn5">See <ref target="#d12fn3">footnote 3, Document 12</ref>.</note> and
                            187-64).<note n="6" xml:id="d19fn6">Dated March 5; not found.</note> I
                        have noted your views and theirs as to the essentiality of linking any such
                        proposals which might be made to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                        Leaving the need for this link to future government decision, as decided at
                        the Principals' meeting, I feel that I must have leeway as to the tactics in
                        exploring possible proposals in these two fields, as well as the remainder
                        of the items in the President's five-point message. As Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> observed at the Principals' meeting, if
                        we were to state initially that the U.S. insists on linking the two
                        measures, we would pay a political price during the initial exploration that
                        we may never need to pay. However, we do not want to state at this time that
                        they are not linked. I believe that the wording suggested by the Chiefs and
                        agreed to by you would, in effect, require us to insist on clear linkage
                        from the start and would thus not be fully responsive to the intent of the
                        Principals' meeting. In view of what appeared to be your judgment as to <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0078"/>the essentiality of linkage, however,
                        my own explorations for the present should not preclude our insisting upon
                        such linkage if and when the Soviets indicate a real interest in the
                        freeze—presuming, of course, that the need for the linkage is ultimately
                        determined to be the U.S. Governmental position.</p>
                    <p>2. With regard to the limitations to be placed on construction and
                        improvement of launchers, we agreed at the last Principals' meeting that the
                        preparation of a detailed position was not desirable at this time. We also
                        agreed on the need for indicating that we would protect the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> even though we could not state at this time
                        just how this would be done. The proposed wording of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> comments on this matter appears to make it
                        virtually impossible to explain, even to our Allies, that there do exist
                        ways and means to protect the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. With regard to prototype testing, we agreed at the last meeting of the
                        Committee of Principals not to restrict R&amp;D efforts in any way which
                        could not be adequately verified, and would therefore place the U.S. at a
                        disadvantage because of its more open society. We also agreed to establish a
                        task force (which is now at work) to study the technical questions involved
                        in controlling various forms of prototype testing, and to await their report
                        before determining the specifics of our position on prototype testing. In
                        the interim, it appears to me that we would fare far better in exploratory
                        discussions if we at least imply a willingness to impose suitable
                        limitations on prototype testing, within the limitations imposed by
                        verification considerations. This appears to be in consonance with the
                        spirit of the basic measure. If the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        does not show any detailed interest we would thus avoid giving the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> an important new propaganda angle from
                        which to attack our proposal. If they do show some active interest, we can
                        use the results of the technical study as a basis for insisting on the
                        continuation of whatever prototype construction and testing activities we
                        ultimately decide are necessary.</p>
                    <p>In setting forth the above, I have attempted to leave open Governmental
                        decisions on the items referred to above—decisions which the Committee of
                        Principals agreed do not have to be made at this time. However, by means of
                        this policy paper, I am trying to arrive at a basis on which we can prepare
                        a presentation to <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> to elaborate on one
                        item of the President's brief message to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> last January 21.<note n="7" xml:id="d19fn7">See <ref target="#d4fn3">footnote 3, Document 4</ref>.</note> I hope,
                        therefore, that you can concur in my latest draft of the subject policy
                        paper which differs from your wording on the three items cited above.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I met yesterday with Sir <persName corresp="#p_PSW1">William
                        Penney</persName>, Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Atomic
                        Energy Authority, as a result of your exchange of correspondence with Prime
                        Minister Home last week in which you agreed, in response to the request of
                        the Prime Minister, to such a meeting of “experts.”<note n="2" xml:id="d20fn2">Home's letter to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, March 17, is reproduced ibid., pp. 126-131.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s letter to
                            Home has not been further identified.</note> Sir William had seen this
                        correspondence exploring the possibility of concurrent announcements between
                        the US, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the Soviet Union
                        concerning planned cutbacks in the rate of production of fissionable
                        material. He wanted, in particular, to discuss for further clarification
                        your response to the Prime Minister's request that the US might immediately
                        deliver all of the <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235, due normally for
                        delivery to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> between now and 1969, in
                        return for the delivery to the US of plutonium from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> according to the original schedule
                        contemplated in the barter agreement entered into between the US and the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in 1959.<note n="3" xml:id="d20fn3">Terms of this agreement are summarized in Senate Report No. 513, July
                            14, 1959, p. 6.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I explained to Sir William that your position is that such a speedup of
                        delivery is not necessary at this time because what is contemplated is only
                        a concurrent announcement on cutbacks of fissionable materials which had
                        already largely been planned in the three countries. I said that it was the
                        feeling of the US that the Prime Minister's proposal, if appropriate at all,
                        would presumably be better related at some future time to an agreement for
                        the complete cutoff of the production of fissionable material. Sir William
                        seemed to understand this and suggested that if such an event should come to
                        pass, which seemed unlikely for a few years, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could again raise the question of immediate delivery of the
                        remaining U-235 at that time; I said that the US would then have to decide
                        at that time as to their response to any such request. Sir William said
                        that, as he saw it, if such a cutoff agreement should be up for
                        consideration at some future time, and if the US didn't feel that they
                        could, at <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0080"/>that time, immediately
                        deliver all of the <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would have the option of either, (1) not
                        signing the cutoff agreement and restarting their Capenhurst plant for the
                        production of <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 in order to meet their
                        planned national goals in thermonuclear weapons, or, (2) signing the
                        agreement and meeting their national requirements for thermonuclear weapons
                        by producing some of them, less desirably, entirely from plutonium without
                        the inclusion of any <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235.</p>
                    <p>Sir William went on to explain to me that they have set national goals for
                        the production and acquisition of the fissionable materials, plutonium and
                            <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235, through 1969, at which time their
                        goals will be met. This requires the production of an additional [<hi rend="italic">text deleted</hi>] weapons grade plutonium and the
                        acquisition of all of the <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 to be obtained
                        from the US through the barter agreement by 1969. He said that with respect
                        to the plutonium, he is recommending that their 8 production reactors, 4 at
                        Chapel Cross and 4 at Windscale, now devoted in large part to the production
                        of civilian power grade plutonium, be converted entirely to the production
                        of weapons grade plutonium. Under this program the required additional [<hi rend="italic">text deleted</hi>] weapons grade plutonium could be
                        produced by 1966 since their reactors can each produce at the rate of about
                            [<hi rend="italic">text deleted</hi>] of weapons grade plutonium per
                        year. Thus, if an agreement to cut off the production of fissionable
                        material was signed by 1966, they would have all of their required plutonium
                        but would still be short that portion of the <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 to be delivered from the US from 1966 to 1969.</p>
                    <p>Sir William indicated that the maximum <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        production rate of <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 was about [<hi rend="italic">text deleted</hi>] per year and that the total cost of
                        their Capenhurst plant was less than some $80 million. This plant, of
                        course, is now no longer producing weapons grade <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 and is producing only a small amount of civilian power grade
                            <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235. He expressed surprise that the
                        French Pierrelatte plant would only produce, as he understood it, about [<hi rend="italic">text deleted</hi>] of <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235
                        per year despite the billion dollar cost.</p>
                    <p>He also mentioned, interestingly, that he understood the French are having
                        trouble in their plutonium production reactors with the leakage of plutonium
                        through the cladding material which surrounds the uranium fuel elements. An
                        ironic consequence of this is that they cannot run to the desired high
                        exposure levels for the plutonium and, hence, are forced to make more low
                        exposure level, weapons grade plutonium, than they might otherwise do.</p>
                    <p>Sir William also mentioned that it was his opinion that the French would
                        conduct a test of a thermonuclear weapon in the Pacific by the end of next
                        year, which, of course, would imply that it would have to be an all
                        plutonium weapon. I regard this as an exceedingly interesting observation

                    <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>I have decided to announce our plan for an additional cutback in the
                        production of Uranium 235 in an address on foreign policy on April 20.</p>
                    <p>I had hoped to make this announcement in conjunction with parallel
                        announcements by the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. I still hope that
                        this will be possible. We are under considerable pressure, however, to
                        proceed promptly with this announcement since major long-term electric power
                        contracts must be renegotiated immediately if the action is to be
                        accomplished in an orderly and expeditious fashion. I have not heard from
                        you on this matter since my oral message of March 9,<note n="2" xml:id="d22fn2">
                            <ref target="#d18">Document 18</ref>.</note> and I do not think I should
                        delay further the public actions necessary to initiate this cutback in the
                        production of Uranium 235.</p>
                    <p>In my speech, I will announce that I have ordered a further reduction of our
                        production of Uranium 235 by an additional 25 percent—which will result in a
                        total reduction of some 45 percent below present levels. This reduction will
                        take place in an orderly fashion over the next four years.</p>
                    <p>I was very gratified to learn in your message of March 2<note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3">
                            <ref target="#d15">Document 15</ref>. The March 2 date is the day
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> delivered the
                            message to <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Llewellyn
                        Thompson</persName>.</note> that the Soviet Government was prepared to
                        announce the ending of construction of two new large reactors for the
                        production of plutonium. At the same time, I urged you in my message of
                        March 9 to consider seriously the possibility of some action on your Uranium
                        235 program since it is our understanding that this program is continuing to
                        expand. I hope that you have decided that such reductions will be possible
                        and that your announcement can more closely parallel those of the United
                        Kingdom and ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Unless I hear from you before April 20, I do not plan to refer in my speech
                        to the possibility of parallel actions by the Soviet Union and the United
                        Kingdom since I am not certain how you will wish to proceed in this matter.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>Your reply to my verbal message of February 28, 1964,<note n="2" xml:id="d23fn2">
                            <ref target="#d15">Document 15</ref>.</note> which expressed our point
                        of view on the question of reducing the production of fissionable materials
                        for military purposes, was transmitted to me.</p>
                    <p>You express satisfaction at our consent to try to search for agreement on
                        this question. I can confirm that we are actually ready for this.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, it appears to me to be necessary, at this stage of our
                        exchange of opinions, to say once more quite definitely that we consider
                        some reduction in the manufacture of fissionable materials for military
                        purposes to be a measure which is most limited in its significance. The
                        reduction in the manufacture of fissionable materials will not only fail to
                        signify liquidation of nuclear weapons, but will not even arrest the process
                        of their further accumulation in the arsenals of states. Accordingly,
                        reaching agreement on this question, if one regards matters in their true
                        perspective, will simply bear witness to the fact that neither side has any
                        intention to compete with the other, without restraint, in an effort to
                        determine who will have the large reserves of raw material for nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>However, for the present situation of international affairs this, too, may
                        turn out to be useful, in as much as any step which in some degree
                        contributes to the strengthening of mutual trust between our two countries,
                        which reflects mutual understanding with respect to the necessity of
                        avoiding nuclear war, may contribute to the creation of more favorable
                        conditions for the solution of those questions upon which in the final
                        analysis the preservation of peace depends. It is for this very reason that
                        we are, in addition to that which has already been accomplished—the Treaty
                        Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under
                        Water, the agreement on not launching into orbit objects with nuclear
                        weapons, some measure of reduction of military expenditures of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>—in favor of now also adding agreement on reducing the
                        manufacture of fissionable materials for military purposes.</p>
                    <p>I consider it necessary to tell you about all this because it is useful for
                        both of us to have a clear understanding of each other's views with <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0084"/>respect to the realistic significance
                        of this measure; otherwise a situation may arise when that limited success
                        which has already been achieved will overshadow those important and urgent
                        tasks which are still far from being solved—the tasks of reaching agreement
                        on measures toward reducing the arms race, on measures of actual
                        disarmament.</p>
                    <p>If I have correctly understood the meaning of your message of March 9,
                            1964<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3">
                            <ref target="#d18">Document 18</ref>.</note> there are a number of
                        points of contact as regards a practical solution of the problem of reducing
                        the manufacture of fissionable materials for military purposes. This
                        pertains, first of all, to the recognition by both sides of the possibility
                        of proceeding to some measure of reducing production of plutonium, as well
                        as uranium-235, for military purposes.</p>
                    <p>As concerns plutonium, here, apparently, there is agreement between us to the
                        effect that we are to discontinue the construction of two new large
                        reactors, while you will shut down four old reactors which have a
                        considerable smaller capacity than the ones we are now building. But with
                        respect to reducing the production of uranium-235, we shall be able to
                        determine our decision after it has become definitely known what steps for
                        reducing the manufacture of fissionable materials will be undertaken by your
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners—England and France.</p>
                    <p>For now, I will only say that we have planned to reduce the manufacture of
                        uranium-235 for military purposes and to increase its consumption for
                        peaceful needs.</p>
                    <p>In this connection I would like to remark that we have noted your expressed
                        consideration as to the fact that the reduction in the manufacture of
                        fissionable materials by our two countries need not necessarily be carried
                        out in equal dimensions. I think that this is a realistic approach to the
                        problem if only because in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> fissionable
                        materials are being produced by three powers—not only by the United States
                        of America but also by your allies—England and France, while among the
                        Socialist countries they are being produced solely by the Soviet Union,
                        which fact, of course, one cannot fail to take into account. Therefore, we
                        shall determine the extent of the reduction in the manufacture of
                        fissionable materials by taking into account their total production by
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries.</p>
                    <p>You have informed me of the fact that you are discussing the question of
                        reducing the manufacture of fissionable materials in England with the
                        English Prime Minister and that you are sure that the English Government
                        would be ready at the proper time to undertake appropriate steps in this
                        direction as its contribution to the simultaneous action of our three
                        countries. It would be desirable, however, to have a specific <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0085"/>understanding as to the steps which England
                        would be ready to undertake.</p>
                    <p>And France? You do not say anything about whether there is any prospect that
                        on her part, too, measures will be undertaken towards reducing the
                        manufacture of fissionable materials for military purposes. I hope that you
                        will agree that it is important for us to know how matters will stand in
                        this respect with France. In speaking of this I cannot refrain from
                        remarking in passing that our specialists continue to insist on the
                        evaluation of the capacity of the French Pierrelatte gaseous diffusion plant
                        which I cited in my preceding message. In doing so, by the way, they cite
                        American publications as well. Also, they confirm their appraisal of the
                        capacity of the new American reactor in Hanford and the four reactors to be
                        shut down, to which capacities I have also referred.</p>
                    <p>It is necessary to clarify one more question as well. As I understand it, we
                        agree with respect to having the actions for reducing the manufacture of
                        fissionable materials carried out by our two countries in a parallel
                        manner—by way of mutual example, i.e., on the basis of faith in each other's
                        intentions.</p>
                    <p>Otherwise in this case it is simply impossible to approach a solution of this
                        problem, since it is a question of such steps as do not provide for actual
                        disarmament and, consequently, their implementation cannot be subjected to
                        control without being detrimental to the legitimate interests of the
                        security of states.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, in your message you speak of the desirability of working
                        out some kind of provisions providing for the verification of the reduction
                        by our two countries in the manufacture of fissionable materials for
                        military purposes. I will tell you frankly: we will not agree to the
                        establishment of control over the enterprises of our atomic industry if at
                        the same time no agreement is reached on disarmament, on the liquidation of
                        nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>As to the factor of mutual trust in the implementation by both sides of
                        reduction in the manufacture of fissionable materials, it seems to me that
                        due significance should be given to this factor. We already have certain
                        experience in this regard: it was on this very mutual trust that we based
                        our agreement not to launch into orbit objects with nuclear weapons. And it
                        seems that this does not disturb either side, because each side relies on
                        the word given by the other side. The same may also be said concerning the
                        steps which we took toward mutual understanding with regard to a certain
                        reduction in military budgets.</p>
                    <p>These are the thoughts, Mr. President, which occur to me in connection with
                        our exchange of opinions on the question of reducing the manufacture of
                        fissionable materials for military purposes. The impression is created that
                        on this problem, apparently, agreement may be reached, it being important
                        merely to know what steps will be taken in <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0086"/>this direction also by other powers producing fissionable
                        materials for military purposes. As to the form of such an understanding,
                        your proposal to prepare and exchange separate statements concerning our
                        proposed action toward reducing the manufacture of fissionable materials and
                        to publish these statements simultaneously is acceptable to us.</p>
                    <p>It seems advisable to us that the statements should likewise reflect the
                        intention of our governments to expand in the future the delivery for
                        peaceful uses fissionable materials from current production or from
                        accumulated reserves. In this connection I should like to note with
                        satisfaction your positive attitude toward our idea of cooperation in the
                        implementation of such big projects as the desalting of sea water, which, as
                        I have already pointed out in a preceding message,<note n="4" xml:id="d23fn4">
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> mentioned

                        needed by a large number of states. If Soviet and American scientists and
                        engineers would combine their efforts in the interests of a more effective
                        solution of the problem of desalting sea water and utilize atomic energy for
                        such purposes, this would be a great and very useful operation. It would
                        also be possible to consider other potential fields of cooperation between
                        our two countries in the utilization of nuclear energy for the good of
                        mankind.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I have received your oral message of April 17<note n="2" xml:id="d24fn2">
                            <ref target="#d22">Document 22</ref>.</note> on the question of the
                        reduction of the production of fissionable materials for military purposes
                            <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0087"/>which you sent through our
                        Ambassador in Washington A. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        and which as it turned out you prepared before you could familiarize
                        yourself with the answering message which I sent you earlier on this
                            question.<note n="3" xml:id="d24fn3">
                            <ref target="#d23">Document 23</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>You state that you intend to make a statement April 20 concerning the plans
                        of the Government of the U.S.A. in connection with a fixed reduction of the
                        production of fissionable materials for military purposes and would like to
                        know whether you could refer in some form or other to the possibility of
                        parallel actions on the part of the Soviet Union in this area.</p>
                    <p>I think the answer, although possibly not complete, to this question of yours
                        is already contained in my last message to you of April 17: we regard the
                        achievement of agreement between our countries on the reduction of the
                        production of fissionable materials for military purposes useful, although
                        naturally we for our part will determine the amount of the reduction of such
                        production of active materials proceeding from a calculation of the total
                        production of them by the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries.</p>
                    <p>As for England, in addition to your communications, I have only just received
                        a message from Prime Minister Douglas-Home<note n="4" xml:id="d24fn4">This
                            message has not been further identified.</note> in which he informs me
                        of his intention to associate himself with your forthcoming statement of
                        April 20 although he is doing this in general form not giving concrete
                        expression to his intention. Concerning the plans of France, nothing as
                        formerly is known to us in this connection, although as I have already noted
                        it is important for us to know this.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, since as a result of the exchange of opinions, agreement in
                        principle between us concerning the desirability of parallel actions in this
                        question has been achieved and, as you point out, it is important for you to
                        make a statement on this question April 20, we also on that day will make a
                        declaration concerning the intentions of the Soviet Union in the matter of
                        the reduction of the production of fissionable materials for military
                        purposes. Our declaration naturally will take into account the above
                        mentioned circumstances complicating for us a determination at the present
                        moment of the specific amount of reduction of the production of uranium-235.
                        As for plutonium, as I have already informed you we shall make a declaration
                        concerning the discontinuance of the construction of two new big atomic
                        reactors for the production of plutonium.</p>
                    <p>And so, we have nothing against your referring in your statement to the
                        receipt from me of a communication concerning the intention of the <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0088"/>Soviet Government to carry out some
                        reduction of fissionable materials for military purposes. For my part, I
                        have in mind to refer in my statement to the receipt of analogous
                        communications from you and from Prime Minister Douglas-Home.</p>
                    <p>I am sure that our parallel statements on the question of the reduction of
                        the production of fissionable materials for military purposes will be
                        interpreted positively by international public opinion as a step in the
                        development of that course which our governments have taken through the
                        conclusion of the treaty on the banning of the testing of atomic weapons in
                        three spheres.</p>
                    <p>Of course, as I have already said, this new measure which it is now possible
                        to consider agreed, is although useful limited in its significance. This is
                        not a disarmament measure. However the very fact that we have succeeded in
                        undertaking certain practical steps as a matter of mutual example—I have in
                        mind both the present agreement and mutual reduction of military
                        budgets—shows that this approach can also be applied beneficially in a
                        number of other instances.</p>
                    <p>Why, for example, do we not attempt to agree in the same manner on the
                        reduction of foreign troops on others' territories? I am familiar with the
                        declarations to the effect that the U.S.A. intends to withdraw from Western
                        Germany 7,500 soldiers and officers transferred there additionally in
                            1961.<note n="5" xml:id="d24fn5">No announcement of these specific
                            numbers of troop withdrawals has been found.</note> We welcome this step
                        of yours. If you would be prepared to go farther and proceed to the
                        reduction of those American troops which are permanently stationed on the
                        territory of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, then I can say right
                        now: we in that case will also be prepared to reduce our troops stationed on
                        the territory of the German Democratic Republic with the provision,
                        naturally, that the reduction of your troops would not be compensated by the
                        further increase in the number of the armed forces of the Federal Republic
                        of Germany itself. It is no secret that recently the West German Bundeswehr
                        is swelling quickly. Your Minister of Defense declared recently that the
                        number of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> troops in Europe already
                        exceeds the number of troops of the countries of the Warsaw Pact<note n="6" xml:id="d24fn6">In a speech to the New York Economic Club on November
                            18, 1963, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that
                            “the Warsaw Pact total [of armed troops] including the Soviets is only
                            about 4,500,000. Against that, it is today the members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> whose active armed forces number over

                            1963-1964, p. 19920)</note> and we understand that this on the whole is
                        directly connected with the rapid growth of the West German Army. All this
                        we must naturally take into consideration.</p>
                    <p>I would be happy to know your views on this score.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for the warm

                    <p>In luncheon remarks to the Associated Press in New York on April 20, 1964,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> declared: “I have
                        ordered a further substantial reduction in our production of enriched
                        uranium to be carried out over a 4-year period. When added to previous
                        reductions, this will mean an overall decrease in the production of
                        plutonium by 20 percent, and of enriched uranium by 40 percent.” He also
                        mentioned that in reaching this decision, he had been in close consultation
                        with Prime Minister Douglas-Home and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, and the latter was releasing a simultaneous

                    <p>At the 528th meeting of the National Security Council on April 22, President
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked about congressional
                        and foreign reactions to his announcement of the cutback, and <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> reported that it had been generally well received

                        that the world reaction “had been generally good, and that the overall
                        tendency was to reflect credit on President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. He said that the Indians liked the action; the
                        Chinese stated that the Soviet Union had been taken in by the United States
                        and that the action indicated that the United States was siding with

                    <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>I have read with great interest your two recent letters<note n="2" xml:id="d26fn2">
                            <ref target="#d23">Documents 23</ref> and <ref target="#d24">24</ref>.</note> and I think we can agree that the separate decisions which
                        we announced on April 20<note n="3" xml:id="d26fn3">
                            <ref target="#d25">Document 25</ref>.</note> have already had a useful
                        effect. Such responsible actions on each side are helpful in moving us
                        forward on the hard road to peace. It was particularly <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0091"/>good to have our announcements come out at
                        the same time, and I send my thanks for your understanding of the need which
                        I faced to make a statement, and for your willingness to make your own
                        statement at the same moment. Throughout the world these actions have been
                        warmly approved, and I have already told your Ambassador how strongly I
                        believe that we should continue the search for further steps along this
                        road.</p>
                    <p>In this spirit I am happy to express my agreement to your suggestion that our
                        scientific and technical experts should cooperate on the problem of
                        desalting sea water, including the possibility that nuclear energy may be an
                        effective force for this purpose. This is a problem which is of great
                        interest not only to our two countries but to many others throughout the
                        world, and we believe that there is every reason for hearty cooperation
                        among the interested nations. I have designated my own Scientific Adviser,
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Donald F. Hornig</persName>, to prepare
                        concrete proposals for cooperative efforts, working with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> of the Atomic Energy Commission.
                        They or their chosen representatives will be ready shortly to begin
                        discussions with those whom you designate. As I understand this problem, it
                        appears to be one which requires a great deal of careful scientific and
                        technical study before we will be ready to undertake large-scale projects,
                        but that is all the more reason for moving ahead urgently, and we on our
                        side are ready. As soon as your representatives are designated, I suggest
                        that we should make a simultaneous announcement of our interest in this
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>I also continue to believe that our representatives in the field of arms
                        control and disarmament should continue to press forward to seek agreement
                        in their great field of work. I will not take your time in this message to
                        repeat the arguments which we have put forward both in my public statements
                        and at Geneva on this subject, but I mention the matter so that you may know
                        that the positions taken by the American Government on this subject have my
                        strong personal support and have been designed, at my direction, to provide
                        real hope for additional useful agreements. We continue to hope that as
                        these proposals are further studied by the Soviet Government the prospects
                        for agreement may improve.</p>
                    <p>In two of your messages, and especially in the most recent one, you refer to
                        the problem of the reduction of troop levels, especially in Germany. I am
                        sorry to have to tell you that I do not think this subject is one on which
                        we can expect to make progress by private discussion between us at this
                        time. The American forces in Germany are there for entirely defensive
                        purposes, and their presence is a matter of great importance for the people
                        and government of West Germany. For there to be any substantial additional
                        reduction in the level of the U.S. forces in Germany there would have to be
                        changes in the situation which would make it <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0092"/>possible for the Germans and others in Western Europe to
                        feel secure in other ways. In the meanwhile, I hope we can continue to
                        cooperate in reducing the level of tension in Central Europe.</p>
                    <p>The problem of the future of Germany is a most important one, and nothing
                        could be better for the peace of the world than a real settlement. We on our
                        side remain ready for such a settlement, which could serve the legitimate
                        interest of the German people as well as the other peoples involved,
                        including your own.</p>
                    <p>I think we should go forward with projects like the desalting of sea water,
                        in which no one can misunderstand the purpose of our cooperation. Meanwhile,
                        of course, we should also work hard to find ways which will reconcile our
                        differences in all fields, with due regard to the interests of others. This
                        is the central purpose of my policy in international affairs. There are
                        differences between us, Mr. Chairman, in important areas, but it should be
                        our purpose to reduce them and to find sensible agreements wherever we can.</p>
                    <p>Let me state again, in closing, my great satisfaction with our success in
                        reaching parallel positions on the cutback of production for nuclear
                        weapons, and my hope that we shall continue to make more progress of this
                        kind.</p>

                            <ref target="#d7">Document 7</ref>.</note> requested a first report by
                        the end of March on “the probabilities and problems involved <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0093"/>in obtaining from the nations signatory to
                        the Test Ban Treaty approval for the utilization of nuclear energy for
                        peaceful explosions under adequate international controls.” This is a
                        response to that request. The problem posed is one which necessarily must be
                        reviewed periodically in the light both of the international situation and
                        the state of our technical development.</p>
                    <p>There are two ways that international agreement to the conduct of Plowshare
                        excavation projects might be obtained. One would be the amendment of the
                        Test Ban Treaty to exclude peaceful uses applications of nuclear explosives
                        from the restraints of the Treaty. The other method would be the approval of
                        specific described projects through the voting procedures prescribed for
                        amendment of the Treaty. Our view, at the present time, is that the second
                        method would be the more likely of success.</p>
                    <p>There appears to be little likelihood, however, that the Soviets would be
                        receptive at this time to any proposal to exempt Plowshare excavation
                        experiments or applications from the Treaty restraints. We have very little
                        evidence of active Soviet interest in the application of nuclear excavation
                        techniques (See Tabs A and B),<note n="3" xml:id="d27fn3">None of the tabs
                            has been found.</note> although the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> leads the world in large-scale excavation with conventional
                        explosives. Clearly, at the time of the Test Ban Treaty negotiations,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> did not envisage early
                        amendment of the Treaty, and his statements about the use of nuclear
                        detonations for peaceful purposes were set in a vague and indefinite future.
                        Perhaps encouraging is <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        April 20 statement about allocating “… more fissionable materials for
                        peaceful uses—in atomic power stations, in industry, agriculture, in
                        medicine, in the implementation of major scientific, technical projects,
                        including the distillation of sea water.”<note n="4" xml:id="d27fn4">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                            April 20 statement. See <ref target="#d25">Document 25</ref>.</note> We
                        note, however, that nuclear excavation was not included specifically in the
                        enumerated activities.</p>
                    <p>We understand that four or five years will be required to develop the devices
                        and cratering technology which would be required in large-scale excavation
                        projects, such as a new trans-Isthmian canal. During this period it would
                        seem important to stimulate international interest and cooperation in the
                        nuclear excavation program to the maximum extent possible. By international
                        participation in Plowshare symposia, observation of cratering shots or
                        experiments and perhaps exchange of test data, it should be possible to
                        demonstrate the economic development potential of nuclear excavation, the
                        absence of hazard to human life and the safeguards that could be provided to
                        prevent evasion of the Treaty for weapons development purposes. Development
                        of international acceptance or even of cooperative effort by Treaty
                        signatories would obviously <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0094"/>provide
                        the most favorable atmosphere in which to seek and gain support for
                        international agreement, under the voting procedures of the Treaty, for
                        approval of specific excavation projects.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> has suggested that the most likely
                        opportunity for raising the question of a treaty amendment for the conduct
                        of nuclear excavation projects probably will be in the context of future
                        international discussion of a comprehensive test ban. In the context of such
                        discussions it might be possible to obtain some easing of the restraints on
                        the conduct of nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes. It is difficult to
                        predict, however, when such discussions might be reopened and it is possible
                        that discussions in this context might lead to more rather than less
                        restrictive conditions on Plowshare. (See Tab C)</p>
                    <p>While development of the nuclear devices can proceed within the Treaty
                        limits, there are some uncertainties as to the limitations placed on the
                        development of the necessary cratering technology by the Treaty language.
                        The committee established by <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 269<note n="5" xml:id="d27fn5">Regarding <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss>
                            269, see <ref target="#d3">Document 3</ref>.</note> is charged with
                        reviewing the facts relating to any prospective nuclear test “which might
                        violate or be regarded as violating the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.” The
                        discussions to date by that committee seem to indicate that the Treaty
                        restraints may well inhibit the development of cratering technology and
                        become a limiting factor earlier than the estimated first large-scale
                        excavation project some four or five years hence. (In presenting the Treaty
                        to the Senate, Administration witnesses, while acknowledging that
                        large-scale applications such as a trans-Isthmian canal could not be carried
                        out under the Treaty, clearly expressed the view that properly devised
                        experiments for developing the excavation technology could be conducted, see
                        Tab D. Similar testimony was given as recently as 4 March 1964 before the
                        Senate Committee on Commerce.)<note n="6" xml:id="d27fn6">The testimony
                            before the Senate Commerce Committee has not been further
                        identified.</note> Certain of the tests designed to develop the necessary
                        cratering technology raise concerns of Treaty violations with some of the
                        committee members. The concern is with the definition of “radioactive debris
                        … present outside the territorial limits” of the United States. While it
                        seems useful to identify the conflicting views on this problem (as is done
                        below), it is not our purpose here to address ourselves to its solution,
                        which is the proper concern of the <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 269
                        committee. The concerns expressed in that forum, however, underline the
                        urgency of establishing an atmosphere of international acceptance of and
                        cooperation on peaceful excavation activities.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> believes that the review committee
                        established by <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 269 can adopt policies
                        of appraisal which would allow many of the cratering experiments to be
                        carried out. If so, the need for a Treaty amendment <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0095"/>would be obviated for some years.
                        Furthermore, if cratering experiments are carried out with international
                        observation, an atmosphere can be created in which an amendment could be
                        obtained more easily.</p>
                    <p>In <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>'s opinion a particularly appropriate
                        consideration in appraising cratering experiments, in view of the Treaty
                        limitation on causing debris “to be present” beyond territorial boundaries,
                        is the internationally accepted technical definition of when radionuclides
                        are considered “not present.” Such a definition is found in the health
                        protection guides of both <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the US
                        (10 <gloss target="#t_CFR1">CFR</gloss> 20) as well as in the guides of the
                        International Commission on Radiation Protection and the International
                        Atomic Energy Agency. In addition a precedent for the use of this definition
                        in interpreting an international treaty is found in the operation of the
                        McMurdo nuclear reactor and the very slight attendant release of
                        radioactivity within the limits of 10 <gloss target="#t_CFR1">CFR</gloss>
                        20. This procedure is considered by the US to be consistent with the
                        prohibition in the Antarctica Treaty of 1961, to which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is a party, against “disposal there of
                        radioactive waste material.”<note n="7" xml:id="d27fn7">Signed on December

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> points out that the legal basis for such
                        policies of appraisal is the principle of “de minimis” or the application of
                        a “rule of reason” to interpret otherwise imprecise provisions of law. Since
                        the Test Ban Treaty does not contain precise technical criteria, it becomes
                        necessary for the <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 269 committee to
                        decide when debris might be considered “present.” Among other relevant
                        material to be considered in deciding this question is the understanding of
                        the Senate in advising and consenting to the Treaty. In this connection, the
                        Foreign Relations Committee reported, after hearing all the testimony on
                        this and other questions, its understanding that “the Plowshare program will
                        not be seriously inhibited by the Treaty.”<note n="8" xml:id="d27fn8">For

                    </p>
                    <p>It should also be noted that, since the technical definition of when
                        radionuclides are “not present” is when their concentration is small
                        compared to maximum permissible concentrations under health protection
                        guides, the levels of radiation involved in this definition are
                        internationally accepted as being far below the point where there might
                        begin to be a health hazard. Thus, this definition would be consistent with
                        a stated objective of the Treaty “to put an end to the contamination of
                        man's environment by radioactive substances.”</p>

                        repercussions if debris attributable to U.S. underground nuclear explosions
                        should be picked <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0096"/>up outside our
                        territorial limits (Tab E). The Tass press release and related cable from

                            reference presumably is to an <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> test
                            of a small nuclear device (called Pike) in Nevada on March 13. In a

                            Bundy</persName> noted in part that the device “partially vented” and
                            produced “measurable quantities of radioactive debris at considerable
                            distances from the test site. Although there is no evidence that the
                            debris was detected outside the United States or that the Mexican
                            authorities were in a position to measure it, the possibility cannot be
                            excluded that measurable quantities of debris did, in fact, cross into
                            Mexico. There remains, therefore, a remote possibility that charges may
                            be made subsequently that this event constituted a violation of the
                            Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.” (Johnson Library, National Security File,

                        F) show that the Soviets are fully alert to this possibility. In these
                        circumstances, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> is concerned that the
                        good faith of the United States in seeking arms control agreements could be
                        thrown into doubt by possible charges of violation, and that our reputation
                        as a country which takes its treaty obligations seriously could be
                        prejudiced. As to the consideration suggested by the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> for appraising what is acceptable under the Test Ban
                        Treaty, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> believes that its application
                        would result in a substantial risk of incurring the international
                        consequences described above. The Treaty speaks simply of causing
                        “radioactive debris” to be “present” outside territorial limits and there is
                        nothing in the text itself to indicate that the presence of small amounts of
                        debris should be accepted. Finally <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                        calls attention to arguments that could be made against the suggested policy
                        of appraisal on the basis of official U.S. records published in connection
                        with the Treaty. (Tab E)</p>
                    <p>Whether or not the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> interpretation is
                        accepted by the review committee as a standard of appraisal, it can be borne
                        in mind as possible rebuttal should any nuclear test accident, either
                        weapons or Plowshare, bring forth Soviet charges of Treaty violations.</p>
                    <p>In summary, we urge</p>
                    <p>a) the question of amending the Treaty be kept under continuing surveillance,</p>

                    <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName>:</p>
                    <p>This is in reply to your memorandum of 8 May to the Committee of Principals,
                        requesting comments on the paper “Verification of Freeze on Strategic
                        Nuclear Vehicles.”<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">The memorandum and the draft
                            paper have not been further identified. Regarding other drafts of this
                            paper, see <ref target="#d21">Document 21</ref> and <ref target="#d28fn3">footnotes 3</ref> and <ref target="#d36fn4">4,
                                Document 36</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I am glad to note certain changes in the present paper which I believe are
                        steps in the right direction. Specifically, paragraph 8 on page 14 no longer
                        says that only a “small” number of undeclared facilities would be eligible
                        for inspection and it makes explicit that no disclosures of unilateral
                        information would be necessary to justify on-site inspection. These changes
                        bear on problems of the perishability and possible compromise of unilateral
                        intelligence which have concerned me for some time.</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, I remain concerned about the reliance placed on unilateral means
                        to verify declarations and to help police controls over production and
                        launcher construction. As the paper itself notes, our present means are
                        inadequate in some areas. Moreover, if we go ahead with this proposal, there
                        can be no assurance that we will not in the future be deprived of some of
                        the intelligence we now possess.</p>
                    <p>I hope that further thought can be given to ways in which the negotiated
                        inspection arrangements can be expanded. In particular, I continue to think
                        it important that the number of on-site inspections to check undeclared
                        facilities be large enough to protect against the perishability of
                        intelligence and the danger of its compromise.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        suggests that we a) settle for a less comprehensive agreement (dropping
                        prohibitions on transfer and concentrating on an agreement not to assist
                        manufacture by potential nuclear powers) and b) undertake publicized

                        will contain nuclear weapon non-manufacture and non-transfer provisions.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> believes the Soviets have
                        a forceful argument in charging that we are “keeping two sets of books” on

                        language for Geneva to indicate that the U.S. will seek “assurances” from
                        its <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> partners against proliferation. He
                        feels we should emphasize what is now only “implicit” in our existing

                        At the same time, he is clearly aware of possible British and Italian
                        domestic embarrassment (forecast by the disarmament negotiators of both

                        the proposal and, preferably, not before. <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>, on the other hand, believes the Russians may be frightened
                        off and will continue to distort our proposal, unless we give clear
                        assurances that we do not seek to inspect their operational launch forces.</note>
                    <p>To do this, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> suggests we now spell out
                        general procedures for a quota of on-site inspections of suspected new

                        <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and the Chiefs, however, believe that
                        this approach would leave the implication that we do not seek comprehensive
                        inspection rights. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>
                        acknowledges that semantic foot-work could help somewhat—e.g., if we change
                        our language from “control over the number of launchers” to “verification of
                        limitations on launchers”—but he continues to desire early agreement along
                        the lines of <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>'s proposed quota
                        presentation.</p>

                    <p>Of the other issues considered for inclusion on the agenda, only the cut-off
                        of fissionable material production is likely to be ready; except for second

                        particular troublesome problems should arise at this late date. The <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> paper on prototype testing is not likely

                            This task force was convened in response to action taken by the

                        production of plutonium and uranium-235 for military purposes. They have met
                        with widespread approval throughout the world. After concluding the treaty
                        banning nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and under
                        water and reaching the understanding not to station in outer space any
                        objects carrying nuclear weapons, this new step agreed upon between us
                        constitutes, in effect, a third milestone on the way to ending the nuclear
                        weapons race.</p>
                    <p>It is good that such a course is gradually becoming established in the
                        relations between our countries, and in international relations in general,
                        although, of course, we both know that the progress achieved along this line
                        is still limited, on the whole, especially if it is compared with the
                        vastness of the problem that confronts our countries and all mankind, that
                        is, the elimination of the threat and the very possibility of a nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>As I learned from your message, you agree with our proposal that we now take
                        a step forward in the field of cooperation between our countries in the
                        peaceful uses of atomic energy, that is, in solving the problem of the
                        desalinization of sea water. That is also a useful undertaking and, after
                        receiving your reply, I immediately gave instructions to our appropriate
                        organizations to start preparing for the forthcoming meeting with the
                        American representatives.</p>
                    <p>You suggested that both sides issue a statement simultaneously concerning our
                        mutual interest in solving the problem of the desalinization of sea water.
                        That is acceptable to us. For our part, we are prepared to publish a
                        statement by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> State Committee on
                        the use of atomic energy concerning the understanding reached on the meeting
                        of Soviet and American specialists for the joint study of scientific and
                        technical <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0103"/>questions relating to the
                        desalinization of sea water by means of nuclear energy. If you have no
                        objection, such a statement by us and a similar one from the American side
                        could be published about a week after the transmittal of this communication
                        by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. As for the
                        practical details of the preparations for the forthcoming meeting, including
                        the time and place of the meeting, it will not be difficult to coordinate
                        them through diplomatic channels.</p>
                    <p>We are, of course, pleased with whatever contributions have been made to the
                        improvement of the international situation; this provides further assurance
                        that cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America
                        in this matter is not an impossibility but quite within the realm of
                        reality. In this connection, I liked your recent statement that you will
                        henceforth try every path to peace, that you intend to keep moving forward
                        and that, after all, the United States is not standing still. I can
                        definitely assure you that we, for our part, will be equally dynamic and
                        equally flexible in searching out ways to promote peace.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of possible reductions in foreign troops in
                        Germany.]</p>
                    <p>In your message you mention the US proposal submitted at the Geneva
                        conference on disarmament. I am acquainted with these proposals, just as you
                        yourself are of course acquainted with ours. I do not think there is any
                        need at present to enter into details, but if it is a question of the whole
                        gamut of disarmament proposals, then we surely have before us an unlimited
                        field for serious work on the finding of ways to achieve agreements. The
                        Soviet Government has made, and is making, considerable efforts to plow this
                        field and to grow a good crop on it. However, to be perfectly frank, we do
                        not have the feeling that the other party is acting along the same lines.
                        The fact is that there has not yet been any progress in the Geneva
                        negotiations, and the state of the disarmament problem naturally leaves us
                        with a strong feeling of disappointment.</p>
                    <p>Now you are in favor of our representatives, who are dealing with disarmament
                        problems, being instructed to make a really persistent effort to reach
                        agreement in this important area. Why not? Let them work a little longer,
                        and a little harder; we have to explore every possibility to the end, that
                        is my feeling. We shall give our representative in the Committee of 18 the
                        necessary instructions. And to increase the chances of success, to ensure
                        that the disarmament negotiations do not again sink into routine, let us
                        both follow the work of our representatives more closely; let us prod them a
                        little if that is needed. As you will obviously remember, as early as 1962,
                        before the beginning of the work of the Committee of 18, the heads of states
                        and the member governments of the <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0104"/>Committee agreed to take a personal interest in the course of the
                            negotiations.<note n="4" xml:id="d31fn4">Reference is to the exchange of
                            correspondence between <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            and Prime Minister Macmillan and President Kennedy on this question in
                            February and early March 1962. For texts of their messages, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1962</hi>, Vol. I, pp.
                            25-26, 32-38, 49-57, 61-63, and 75-81.</note> That was a sensible
                        decision.</p>
                    <p>I am thinking that sometime soon it might be useful to instruct our ministers
                        of foreign affairs to examine the course of the negotiations. They could do
                        this, for example, during the XIX Session of the General Assembly of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. They will of course have other
                        matters to discuss. Let us see what concrete results can be achieved by our
                        ministers. And then, perhaps, the need will arise for us to meet. We
                        understand that similar views are current in Washington also. But this is,
                        of course, a matter for the future. We should not run too far ahead.</p>

                    <p>I-25047/64</p>
                    <p>Dear Butch:</p>
                    <p>I have reviewed the rewritten paper on the cutoff of fissionable material and
                        find that the changes which you and the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>
                        made are a distinct improvement to the paper.<note n="2" xml:id="d32fn2">Entitled “Cutoff of Fissionable Material Production and Transfer to
                            Peaceful Uses as Separable Measures,” June 4. (Ibid.)</note> As you
                        know, the Chiefs have not commented on the verification annex in its present
                            form<note n="3" xml:id="d32fn3">Entitled “Inspection of a Fissionable
                            Material Cutoff,” June 4, and attached as Annex A to the above
                            referenced paper.</note> but I feel they are now in general agreement
                        with the paper with the following exceptions:</p>
                    <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0105"/>
                    <p>a. They desire overflights and some monitoring of atomic explosions for
                        peaceful purposes. As the Secretary said last week, we believe that the
                        question of overflights need not be decided at this time, and therefore a
                        policy of conscious ambiguity is appropriate on this matter.<note n="4" xml:id="d32fn4">
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> expressed these views
                            in his letter to <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, June 3.
                            (Ibid.)</note> As for the matter of monitoring atomic explosions for
                        peaceful purposes, the Secretary made it clear that we believe this is a
                        subject more appropriately discussed in the context of the test ban.</p>
                    <p>b. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have also stated that: “Until the
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards organization and
                        procedures are strengthened and the concept of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspection of a US/<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        cutoff agreement can be evaluated, adversary resident inspection of declared
                        facilities is required as one of the safeguards against Soviet
                            cheating.”<note n="5" xml:id="d32fn5">The quotation is from the
                            memorandum from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to Secretary of Defense
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, May 28, <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>-449-64. (Ibid.)</note> It is our
                        understanding, based primarily on Section I of the verification annex, that
                        this requirement is adequately recognized in the cutoff paper, and that we
                        are not at this time firmly committed to an <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> role.</p>
                    <p>c. As neither the Chiefs nor the Government as a whole have studied the
                        problem of cutoff and transfer together, I would appreciate it if you would
                        not authorize discussions now of transfer of over 60,000 kilograms for the
                        United States and of a US/<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> ratio
                        greater than 2. The Chiefs' study on this subject should be available some
                        time next month. At that time the Secretary will forward his views on any
                        possible increase in our transfer proposal.</p>
                    <p>If these suggestions are acceptable to you, we have no objection to the use
                        of the revised paper in the Geneva negotiations, or elsewhere, as
                        appropriate.</p>

                        request your approval for use of this position paper as guidance for the

                        a working paper.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with the position approved by President Kennedy in November
                            1962,<note n="3" xml:id="d33fn3">In a memorandum to President Kennedy,
                            November 20, 1962, <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> made
                            recommendations regarding U.S. positions at the resumption of the Geneva
                            disarmament talks, and President Kennedy approved them on November 21,

                        discussed these proposals in Geneva; you will also recall that the cutoff
                        proposal was included in your January 21 message to the Geneva Conference.
                        Thus, the enclosed position paper does not involve new proposals, rather the
                        paper contains elaboration of our existing proposals, particularly with
                        regard to verification. The working paper which the position paper
                        authorizes the Delegation to table at the Conference would constitute the
                        first detailed United States public statement to be made on inspection of
                        the cutoff since the measure was initially suggested by the United States in
                        1955.</p>
                    <p>The position paper has been developed through extensive interagency
                        consultation and has been approved by the Department of State. In addition,
                        the position paper and annex now presented for approval were redrafted in
                        light of Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s letter of June 3, 1964, expressing his own views and
                        transmitting those of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, enclosed at Tab B. I am

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPOA1">Solbert</persName>'s letter indicates that the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff are in general agreement with the inspection
                        provisions, with the exception of two <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0107"/>matters: they desire overflights and some monitoring of atomic explosions
                        for peaceful purposes. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has indicated that the question of overflights need not
                        be decided at this time, and therefore a policy of conscious ambiguity as
                        incorporated in the paper is appropriate on this matter. As for the matter
                        of monitoring atomic explosions for peaceful purposes, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> made it clear that he believes
                        this is a subject more appropriately discussed in the context of the test
                        ban.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have also stated that: “Until the
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards organization and
                        procedures are strengthened and the concept of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA
                        </gloss> inspection of a US/<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> cutoff
                        agreement can be evaluated, adversary resident inspection of declared
                        facilities is required as one of the safeguards against Soviet cheating.” As
                        indicated by Section I of the verification annex, this requirement is
                        recognized in the cutoff paper, and we are not, at this time, firmly
                        committed to an <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> role.</p>
                    <p>The Joint Chiefs also believe that the relative advantages and disadvantages
                        of a combination cutoff and transfer proposal have not been thoroughly
                        analyzed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has
                        asked the Joint Chiefs to conduct such an analysis, but has noted that the
                        paper is consistent with the position approved by President Kennedy in
                        November 1962. The Department of Defense, through Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPOA1">Solbert</persName>, has asked that we not authorize
                        discussions now of transfer of over 60,000 kilograms for the United States
                        and of a US/<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> ratio greater than 2. The
                        Chiefs' study on this subject should be available some time next month. At
                        that time the Secretary will forward his views on any possible increase in
                        our transfer proposal. This is acceptable to <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> has also concurred in this position
                        paper with a few clarifying comments. On the basis of discussions of these
                        comments with the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> staff we are in
                        agreement with them. (Tab D)<note n="5" xml:id="d33fn5">Letter from

                            page 2) on the intended uses of allowed production. Without this, it is
                            doubtful that unilateral intelligence could provide the necessary

                        reasonable.”</note> All agencies concur with this point and it will be taken

                    <p>At 12:10 p.m. Commissioners <persName corresp="#p_TGF1">Gerald
                        Tape</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PJG2">John Palfrey</persName>, and I
                        attended the meeting of the National Security Council held in the Cabinet
                        Room of the White House. Those present included President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Alexis Johnson,
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>, Taylor, <persName corresp="#p_BH8">Harold Brown</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_JCE1">Charles Johnson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GK3">Gordon</persName>, Carter,

                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965 underground test series—the
                        Whetstone series. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                        called upon me to make the introductory remarks.</p>
                    <p>I gave a description of our <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965
                        underground test program (Whetstone). In particular, I noted that the
                        Commission was caught in the position that it must not violate either the
                        safeguards or the test ban treaty and, thus, it has to walk a rather tenuous
                        middle course. I said that there could be no guarantee against venting,
                        although we think the probability of venting is very small. I described the
                        number of tests planned, in the development category to be carried on by the
                            <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>; in the Plowshare category to be
                        carried on by the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>; and in the weapons
                        effects and detection category to be carried on by the Department of Defense
                        in collaboration with the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>I then called upon General Crowson, who made a presentation of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> development tests, with charts. There being
                        no questions on this, I then called upon General Donnelly, who made a
                        presentation covering the weapons effects and weapons detection tests, using
                        charts.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked whether the Long
                        Shot device (to be detonated at Amchitka Island in the Aleutians) to give
                        data on the detection of underground nuclear explosions would be an old
                        reliable device or an advanced type. I said that it would be an old reliable
                        device because we needed to be sure of its operation and of its yield.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked if we could
                        invite the Russians to be involved in some way in this test, and I said I
                        thought that we could. Bundy mentioned the problem of the effect of this
                        test in Alaska; a problem which is probably psychological but nevertheless
                        very real. I then called upon John Kelly, who described the Plowshare tests,
                        with the help of charts.</p>
                    <p>At the end of this presentation, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked me how many tests there had been this last
                        year; and, when I told him, he asked why there are so many planned for this
                        year. I explained that the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>
                        <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0109"/>had refrained from testing during the
                        summer months last year during the sensitive period of test ban negotiations
                        and, thus, due to the fact that the testing last year was for a shorter
                        period, the rate of testing this year will not be much greater. I also
                        indicated that it might not be possible to make as many tests as are being
                        requested, but that it is important to have the flexibility in preparing for
                        the entire number. Then, if some of the tests turn out to be unexpectedly
                        difficult or to yield unexpected results, it might be that it will not be
                        possible or desirable to carry out every test in the series; on the other
                        hand, it might be desirable to add some as yet not foreseen tests to the
                        series. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> added
                        that the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> program included more tests
                        this year, which adds considerably to the increase; the reason for this is
                        that it took some time to get ready for the complex tests in their series.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> went on to say that he
                        thinks it is a good series and that the entire number should be approved. He
                        also mentioned a couple of tests in 1962 in the low kiloton range. He said
                        he feels that we can detect tests down to the low kiloton level. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> commented on the
                        comparison in the numbers between the U.S. and Soviet underground tests and
                        asked why the Soviets had such a small number.</p>
                    <p> Bundy replied that the Soviets used to say that they couldn't afford an
                        underground testing program. He also said that he feels that their program
                        is consistent with the rather restrained rocket program that they apparently
                        are engaged in. Bundy went on to say that he is not persuaded that we should
                        develop high yield weapons just in order to test the effects of such
                        weapons, and he asked <persName corresp="#p_BH8">Harold Brown</persName> to
                        comment on this. Brown said that there is no approved program for high yield
                        tests, but he said that tests in the Whetstone program will help us be ready
                        to test weapons in the 100-megaton range should that become desirable.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that this
                        aspect of the program is not very expensive, and he thinks that work along
                        this line should continue.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> then asked me
                        whether this program can be carried out within our budget without asking for
                        an increase. I replied that I think it can. We had approximately $117
                        million in our budget for this purpose and we will need to augment it by
                        about $13 million, which can be done by transferring funds from production.
                        Bundy suggested that the matter of approval be handled as in the past; thus,
                        it might be proper to authorize only the first quarter of the series, i.e.,
                        Whetstone I, at this time. I pointed out that we had been working under
                        rather flexible authorization in the past. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that he wouldn't recommend any
                        reduction. He pointed out that we don't know what Soviet plans are, and they
                        might resume testing. Another possibility might be that we would move toward
                        a comprehensive test ban. Thus, he said that all in all, from a foreign
                        policy point of view, he feels we should carry on a vigorous underground
                        program at about the level for which approval is <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0110"/>being sought. The implication is that we will hear from the
                        White House soon regarding the approval for Whetstone I.</p>

                        Conference. This paper is essentially an elaboration of our present position
                        particularly with regard to the requirements for verification.</p>
                    <p>In order to achieve agreement, the paper intentionally avoids facing the
                        issue of whether or not aerial reconnaissance should be involved in the
                        verification procedure. Although there is agreement among all other agencies
                        that aerial reconnaissance is not necessary in connection with this
                        agreement, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommends that a
                        provision for aerial overflight <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0111"/>be
                        included. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has
                        informally advised Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> that he
                        is prepared to overrule the JCS on this issue but would prefer not to do so
                        unless the Soviets show some interest in the proposal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> agreed to fuzz the language on
                        inspection so that it would not necessarily preclude subsequent
                        consideration of aerial inspection. Although this is a touchy point since
                        even the hint that we are considering aerial inspection as a condition for
                        this proposal would completely discredit it abroad, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> believes they can live with this instruction for the time
                        being by avoiding the issue in Geneva.</p>
                    <p>Subject to your approval, the paper will be submitted for information to
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> next Tuesday<note n="5" xml:id="d35fn5">June 23.</note> and will be presented by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> in Geneva next Thursday.<note n="6" xml:id="d35fn6">On June 25, the U.S. Delegation submitted the U.S.

                        of the proposed position and mentioned two areas which warranted further

                        in the existing paper arose from the Joint Chiefs' views that production of
                        additional subassemblies, such as guidance packages and re-entry vehicles,
                        should be monitored, while <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and other
                        agencies had not concurred in this proposal. In addition, the present paper
                        postponed resolution on some of the key issues which were still under
                        discussion in the basic position paper agreed upon in March.<note n="4" xml:id="d36fn4">Reference presumably is to the undated draft paper

                        These included: (a) What type of control should be applied to launchers; (b)

                    <p>With relation to <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KSMJ1">Keeny</persName> suggested that there should be a
                        specific reference to them in the paper to avoid giving rise to the
                        misconception that <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s had been dropped
                        from the freeze or that no inspection was required. Secretary Vance and
                        General Taylor requested <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0113"/>information
                        on exactly what was our position on the inclusion of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s since they were unclear on agreed linkage of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s to the remainder of the freeze proposal.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> quoted from the
                        President's 21 January message to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>
                        which included strategic defensive missiles and from a speech by the U.S.
                        representative referring to <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s in later
                        presentations at Geneva.<note n="5" xml:id="d36fn5">For example, <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> mentioned anti-missile systems
                            in his statement to the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee on April
                            16. (Ibid.)</note> He pointed out that <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s were just as much an agreed matter for exploration as were the
                        offensive missiles, although we had consistently indicated that precise
                        definition of such systems had not been arrived at. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that he understood <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s had been included at the request of <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> to provide against a possible loss of
                        deterrence if only offensive vehicles were frozen.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked for information on
                        Soviet interest in the freeze proposal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> indicated that the Soviets had shown no enthusiasm
                        but nevertheless had given evidence of careful study since their statements
                        had emphasized many of the unanswered questions and twisted them to Soviet
                        advantage. In particular, the question of inspection and verification had
                        been misconstrued in order to make it appear very unacceptable. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> felt that the present
                        paper was needed in order to make the record straight on our ideas on
                        inspection which had been designed to minimize intrusion consistent with
                        maintaining U.S. security.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> indicated he felt the
                        present subject needed <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> discussion and
                        questioned how we could avoid the four subjects upon which no decisions had
                        yet been reached. Upon request for a schedule as to when these matters might
                        be completed, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Scoville</persName> indicated
                        that the launcher question was basic to the entire <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> problem and it had been agreed that no attempt would be
                        made to reach a decision until after the Soviets had evidenced constructive
                        interest in the freeze proposal. With respect to prototype testing, a paper
                        had been prepared and distributed to the Principals<note n="6" xml:id="d36fn6">See <ref target="#d30fn7">footnote 7, Document
                        30</ref>.</note> whose reply was presently being awaited. The problem of
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems definition had proven
                        technically very difficult and a task group had just been formed to try and
                        clarify this problem along with our ideas on how such controls on these
                        systems could be verified. However, results could not be expected until
                        August. The question of aerial surveillance would be resolved at any time
                        that the principals chose to make a decision in this area.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> indicated that our proposed
                        schedule for processing the verification paper involved transmittal to
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> at the earliest possible time for
                        discussion which might be somewhat more limited than the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> discussion on the basic freeze paper.
                        Following this, it would be <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0114"/>discussed
                        in a co-chairmen's meeting at Geneva prior to public presentation at the
                            <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>, probably within three-four weeks
                        (now scheduled for 9 July 1964). This presentation was needed in order to
                        answer the most critical public questions on the nature of the freeze.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> indicated that the other
                        major problem with the position revolved around Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s worries on the use of
                        intelligence to support the verification. He believed that the paper had
                        been modified so that intelligence was primarily in a supporting role but
                        that he believed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> had
                        wished to discuss this matter.<note n="7" xml:id="d36fn7">See <ref target="#d28">Document 28</ref>.</note> In Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s absence, Mr. Marengo indicated
                        that the particular worry concerned the launcher problem which had not yet
                        been defined. The paper proposed no inspection of existing launchers. While
                        intelligence might be adequate for evaluating present declarations on
                        launchers, there would always be a question on adequacy if the deployment
                        made were changed or if mobile launchers were involved. He also worried
                        about the perishability of intelligence and particularly how we could
                        convince Congress and the public that our verification was satisfactory
                        without disclosing intelligence sources.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> agreed that convincing the
                        public and Congress was a problem but one which had been handled
                        satisfactorily in the past. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> himself had been very effective in the test ban hearings
                        and with proper briefings and other measures available to the Executive
                        Branch, it is felt that proper support could be obtained for the measure
                        without compromising our intelligence capabilities. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Scoville</persName> mentioned that the proposed
                        verification procedures used intelligence only to supply the U.S. the
                        necessary information to make decisions. The basis for these decisions need
                        not be disclosed and, therefore, the intelligence source not compromised.
                        This appeared an appropriate use of intelligence in support of U.S.
                        disarmament policy and Mr. Marengo agreed. General Taylor indicated he would
                        like to receive a copy of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s letter on the proposal and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> read the letter to the group.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> pointed out the
                        significance of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s views on the reliance
                        which we could place on intelligence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> next raised the matter of which subassemblies should be
                        monitored. Gen. Taylor believed that the more subassemblies that could be
                        monitored the better, and he indicated that from his studies both guidance
                        system and re-entry vehicle production should be included. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Scoville</persName> indicated that guidance systems
                        had been omitted because of the difficulties in verification. Such systems
                        could be produced in very small facilities, and it would be virtually
                        impossible to detect clandestine production. Including guidance systems
                        would put the U.S. in the position of abiding by a restriction <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0115"/>over which they would have no reasonable
                        possibility of confirming Soviet compliance. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> and Mr. Seamans<note n="8" xml:id="d36fn8">Dr. Robert
                            S. Seamans, Associate Administrator, <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss>.</note> concurred in this evaluation. With respect to
                        re-entry vehicles, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Scoville</persName>
                        indicated that while these might be verifiable, they presented certain
                        security problems to the U.S. Monitoring the production of re-entry vehicles
                        might disclose sensitive U.S. information on warhead or penetration aid
                        characteristics. Therefore it had been decided that it would not be in the
                        U.S. interest to risk disclosure in these areas by allowing foreign
                        inspection of such production. General Taylor indicated that he did not feel
                        strongly on this subject and that if the others concurred, he would not
                        press this point further.</p>
                    <p>Deputy Secretary Vance stated that the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                        was prepared to go ahead with the subject paper as presented. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> indicated that he would like
                        to have the paper revised to define explicitly the status of our existing
                        positions on the unresolved issues: prototype testing; launch site
                        construction; and <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>. He also believed
                        there should be a classified intelligence annex to the paper for discussion
                        with the President which would point out the interaction of intelligence
                        with the proposed verification procedures and the risk to intelligence of
                        disclosure in justifying a measure before Congress and the public. He
                        believed that there should also be a paper which outlined the parliamentary
                        situation, i.e., our schedule and procedures for discussion with <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>, the co-chairman, and the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> and
                        Mr. Seamans indicated they had no problems with the paper as written.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Non-Proliferation</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> opened the discussion on
                        non-proliferation by asking for views on whether we would be prepared to
                        have a non-proliferation agreement along the lines of previously proposed
                        non-dissemination, non-acquisition measures without the participation of
                        Communist China. How critical could the absence of China be to the
                        usefulness of such agreements? The West Germans had indicated that they
                        would go along if the Chinese would. Would the Senate concur in such
                        measures without Chinese participation? Much of the previous thinking, and
                        particularly the Soviet interest, had probably been directed at providing
                        pressure on the Chinese. The possibilities of other countries obtaining an
                        independent nuclear capability were more remote, although India, Israel, and
                        Sweden were potential candidates. He did not wish for any formal Department
                        positions but rather informal views. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> indicated that he felt that Chinese participation was not
                        essential in order to have a very useful measure. The acquisition of a
                        nuclear capability by China at some time in the not too distant future had
                        already <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0116"/>been written off by most of
                        the world since no one at the present time saw any particularly promising
                        way of preventing this. If we continue to insist on the participation of
                        China as a precondition to non-proliferation agreements, this would indicate
                        that the U.S. had written off non-proliferation as a viable measure. Other
                        nations would question our sincerity in this area and this, in turn, might
                        influence their decisions on developing nuclear capabilities. General Taylor
                        asked whether we would propose to treat China as a nuclear power once she
                        detonated her first nuclear weapon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> indicated that we should continue to use pressure, even
                        after the detonation, to get China to adopt a sane nuclear policy. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked whether the Government
                        has seriously looked at the problem of giving India nuclear weapons in the
                        event that China had such a weapon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> indicated that he knew of no detailed look, but that he
                        felt rather strongly that it would be more desirable to have U.S. controlled
                        weapons providing defense or a deterrence against nuclear attack on India
                        rather than India's having its own nuclear capability. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> indicated that he did not wish to
                        prejudge this question but that he felt such a look would be useful. He
                        pointed out that no Government position exists as to whether we would oppose
                        other nations having nuclear weapons once China obtains them.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then stated that he had
                        considered a new U.S. approach to the problem of non-dissemination. This
                        approach might take the form of a draft treaty on non-dissemination of
                        nuclear weapons. In addition, we would circulate a letter with those
                        statements of our policy relative to <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        which state that this force should not lead to additional new national
                        nuclear capabilities. This approach might replace the agreed minute under
                        which we operate at the present time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLC1">Meeker</persName> indicated that he thought this would be a good approach
                        since silence can be considered as meaning consent. The treaty would not be
                        signed initially, but a “letter of intent” would be circulated first to the
                        nuclear powers and then to the non-nuclear powers. This would provide the
                        opportunity for each to indicate his “intent” but not to the point of
                        commitment until it could be ascertained which other countries were going to
                        be included.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> indicated that although
                        the Soviets have always stated that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        is their only objection to a non-dissemination agreement, they may indeed
                        have others. However, we had reason to believe that the Soviets had a real
                        interest in non-dissemination and that, therefore, this might be in an area
                        in which we had sufficient community of interest to obtain an agreement. He
                        felt that we should work out a draft agreement and “letter of intent” and
                        then send it around to see how many nations would join us, and then see who
                        was missing.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> indicated and others
                        generally concurred that this was a matter worth exploring.</p>
                    <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0117"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he had some
                        questions about Recommendation #1 in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>'s letter of 15 June on non-proliferation of nuclear
                        weapons and the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.<note n="9" xml:id="d36fn9">This recommendation stated: “That a policy decision be

                            some public commitment by the non-nuclear participants not to acquire a
                            national nuclear capability.” (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>; Johnson Library, National Security

                        that it singled out the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> members to make

                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> indicated that he had

                    <p>It was agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> would

                    <p>The 6 June 1964 paper outlining procedures for verification of freeze on
                        strategic nuclear delivery vehicles was discussed with particular attention
                        being given to the following points:</p>
                    <p>a. The four unresolved issues; i.e.:</p>
                    <p>(1) Types of controls to be applied to launchers;</p>
                    <p>(2) Limitations to be placed on research and development and prototype
                        testing: </p>
                    <p>(3) The definition of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems to be
                        included in the freeze; and</p>
                    <p>(4) The need for aerial surveillance in connection with spot inspections.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the status of these unresolved issues should be made clear
                        in the position paper or, in the case of aerial surveillance, in the
                        forwarding letter to the White House.</p>
                    <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0118"/>
                    <p>b. The relationship of intelligence to the verification of the freeze and the
                        risks of compromise to intelligence sources.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that a classified annex discussing this relationship should be
                        prepared for presentation to the White House prior to the use of the
                        verification paper at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>c. The vehicle sub-assemblies which should be controlled under the freeze.</p>
                    <p>After General Taylor presented the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> views
                        and general discussion thereon, it was agreed that guidance systems and
                        re-entry vehicles should not be added to the sub-assemblies listed in the
                        subject paper.</p>
                    <p>The proposed paper on the verification of the freeze was then approved
                        subject to the changes and additions discussed above.</p>
                    <p rend="center">ACTION TAKEN ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION PAPER</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> requested informal views
                        on the importance of the participation of Communist China in any
                        non-dissemination, non-acquisition measure. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> expressed the views that such measures would still
                        have great usefulness without Chinese participation since he felt it still
                        important to prevent additional countries from becoming nuclear powers.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> pointed out that at the
                        moment no Governmental position existed as to whether we would oppose other
                        nations, and particularly India, having nuclear weapons once China obtains
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested consideration
                        be given to approaching the non-proliferation matter by means of a “letter
                        of intent” in the form of a draft treaty along with a letter restating U.S.
                        policy that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> should not lead to
                        additional national nuclear capabilities. Others concurred in this
                        suggestion as a useful approach.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> expressed concern about

                    <p>In late June and early July 1964, during meetings of the Eighteen-Nation
                        Disarmament Committee in Geneva, <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> and the Soviet Representative Valerian Zorin met
                        privately several times to discuss U.S. and Soviet approaches to arms
                        reductions. At these discussions <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> particularly sought clarification of the Soviet proposal
                        for reduction of military budgets, which Zorin apparently advanced to

                    <p>1. Since publication of <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-2-63, final
                        evaluations of Soviet nuclear devices tested in 1961 and 1962 and
                        re-evaluations of several earlier devices have led to some changes in the
                        estimate of Soviet nuclear weapon capabilities. While new evidence has led
                        to no changes in the previous estimate of <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 production, a small upward revision of current and future
                        plutonium-equivalent production has been necessary. The estimate has been
                        extended to cover a ten-year period to mid-1974.</p>

                    <p>2. Three basic classes of nuclear-powered submarines are known to have been
                        constructed in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and identified in
                        an operational status. (See Table IV).<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3">None of
                            the six tables is printed.</note> A number of these submarines are
                        probably undergoing modifications. The performance of the Lenin and several
                        of the nuclear submarines during 1963 indicates that the Soviets have
                        probably improved the reliability of their naval nuclear propulsion system.
                        We believe, however, that there is a need for further improvement in their
                        nuclear propulsion technology and operational reliability. (Paras. 17-18)</p>

                        the Soviet Government had decided “to discontinue now the construction of
                        two new, big, atomic reactors for the production of plutonium.”<note n="4" xml:id="d39fn4">Quoted from <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s statement, April 20, 1964. (<hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1964</hi>, p. 168)</note> We have no
                        basis, at present, for ascertaining whether or not such construction has
                        been discontinued. The spread shown in Table VI for the years 1967-74
                        represents estimates with and without continuing construction of new reactor
                        facilities. It is estimated that even if reactor construction is
                        discontinued, improvements in reactor operation will lead to increases in
                        future annual plutonium-equivalent production rates. (Paras. 27-28)</p>

                    <p>6. There are four gaseous diffusion isotope separation complexes in the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>: one at Verkh-Neyvinsk in the
                        Urals, one north of Tomsk in Central Siberia, a third at Angarsk in the Lake
                        Baykal region, and a fourth which started operation recently, north of
                        Zaozerniy near Krasnoyarsk. Consideration of all available information leads

                        which is essentially the same as that shown in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-2-63. (Paras. 29-32)</p>
                    <p>7. We estimate that the probable Soviet cumulative <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 production for mid-1964 is 170,000 kilograms and that it is
                        unlikely that actual cumulative <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235

                    <p>8. The Soviets significantly improved their fission and thermonuclear weapon
                        capabilities as a result of the 1961-62 test series. However, the status of
                        Soviet nuclear weapon technology, while highly sophisticated and apparently
                        adequate for their present needs, is such that substantial advances can
                        still be made through further development and testing. We believe that the
                        Soviets are continuing an active weapon development program. They will
                        certainly have a continuing requirement to test at a greater rate<note n="6" xml:id="d39fn6">As of 1 July 1964 three tests had been detected.
                            [Footnote in the source text.] </note> than has been evident since the
                        Test Ban Treaty was initialed in July 1963. (Paras. 42-48, 50-57 and 64)</p>
                    <p>9. Fission Weapons. By 1958, the Soviets had developed implosion devices
                        encompassing a variety of yields and physical dimensions and employing
                        boosting techniques in some cases. The 1961-62 test series provided the
                        Soviets with improved fission weapon capabilities. [<hi rend="italic">2
                            lines of source text not declassified</hi>] However, a large number of
                        new devices were tested without employment of boosting. This perhaps
                        indicates that the Soviets will limit their employment of boosting, thus, in
                        their unboosted weapons gaining simplicity and a reduced requirement for
                        tritium at the cost of some increases in vulnerability, fissionable
                        materials, <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0122"/>and size, and perhaps
                        decreased yield. [<hi rend="italic">2-1/2 lines of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] However, possible undetected tests and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                        might have provided the Soviets with still smaller low-yield weapons.
                        (Paras. 41-45)</p>
                    <p>10. Thermonuclear Developments. By 1958 the Soviets had tested a variety of
                        thermonuclear devices [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not
                            declassified</hi>]. In 1961 and 1962, the Soviets greatly improved the
                        performance of their thermonuclear weapons and extended their yield
                        experience. [<hi rend="italic">10 lines of source text not
                        declassified</hi>]</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Future Weapon Development and Testing</p>
                    <p>12. We have detected only three Soviet tests in the twelve months since the
                        initialing of the Test Ban Treaty in July 1963. There are undoubtedly a
                        variety of useful tests the Soviets could now conduct underground both for
                        research and development and for military purposes. We have no evidence that
                        they have conducted tests banned by the Treaty and do not believe they will
                        resort to such tests so long as the options of underground testing and
                        formal treaty withdrawal are open to them. (Para. 65)</p>
                    <p>13. It is certain that the Soviet weapons laboratories have remained active
                        and are creating new test requirements. The potential improvements
                        obtainable through underground testing together with the high rate of US
                        underground testing [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] between 1 August 1963 and 1 July 1964—must be
                        generating considerable pressure on the Soviet leadership for a more
                        vigorous test program than has been conducted to date. We do not believe,
                        however, that research, development and military requirements alone are now
                        so pressing as to necessitate withdrawal from the Treaty or are likely to
                        become so in the near term. Hence, we believe that political factors will be
                        the major consideration in reaching a decision whether or not to withdraw.
                        If such a decision is made by the Soviets, atmospheric testing by the French
                        or Chinese Communists might provide the pretext. (Para. 66)</p>
                    <p>14. If the Soviets embark on a reasonably extensive underground testing
                        program involving yields up to about 200 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss>,
                        they could achieve, during the period of this estimate, [<hi rend="italic">4
                            lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. Improvements in Soviet
                        low-yield devices which could occur during the period of this estimate are
                        more likely to emphasize the development of small-diameter [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                        warheads rather than [<hi rend="italic">6-1/2 lines of source text not

                    <p>15. Underground testing and simulation techniques would permit the
                        acquisition of a limited amount of weapon effects data, including the effect
                        of ground shock upon hardened underground structure, the effects of nuclear
                        radiation upon materials or systems components, and [<hi rend="italic">less

                            Principals under cover of a memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, July 9. A prefatory note to this paper states
                            that it was based “on the U.S. statement in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> together with the substance of the amendments transmitted
                            in Todis 1508 of July 7.” (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_RD2">RD</gloss> Files: Lot 68 D 452,

                            Files, DEF 18-3.</note> was quite complicated and questioned whether
                        this would be understandable to the political representatives at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> pointed out that most of the representatives at the
                            <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> had been intimately involved in
                        the disarmament problem for two or more years and were therefore quite used
                        to handling papers of this sort. He added that many of the items here had
                        been previously handled in briefer form in the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> and the objective was to present this more detailed material
                        on verification in order to answer and clarify certain Soviet objections.
                        Certain areas of the freeze were not covered, such as <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0124"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s, prototype testing and elaboration on
                        the launcher problem. He felt that it was very desirable, however, to
                        present this material on either the 6th or the 20th of August since these
                        were the two dates during the present session at which the U.S. would be in
                        a position to select the topics.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> believed the paper was
                        suitable for presentation but suggested two additional paragraphs; one at
                        the beginning and one at the end. The initial introduction would point out
                        that the freeze was a serious U.S. proposal but that the present paper was
                        illustrative in nature and not a complete or definitive U.S. position. These
                        and other subjects would have to be negotiated out in detail. A final
                        paragraph would be added which would point out that this paper did not cover
                        all subjects and would list the various items which would have to be
                        considered at a future time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> concurred in the concept of an introductory paragraph
                        which would put the present statement in an illustrative context. He
                        doubted, however, the desirability of mentioning the specific items in a
                        final paragraph since this might open these for detailed discussion at a
                        time when the U.S. had not yet achieved agreed upon positions. In this
                        connection he indicated that the insertion (Page 11) on launch site
                        inspection proposed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
                        would raise some problems since we did not have a position on the desired
                        type of controls on launch sites.<note n="4" xml:id="d40fn4">Reference
                            presumably is to a later paper, “Proposed Modifications in Draft U.S.

                            a Freeze on Strategic Nuclear Vehicles.” July 17, which has not been
                            found.</note> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        indicated that he, too, felt some kind of an introduction was needed to
                        point out that this was only a partial discussion of the problem but agreed
                        that specific issues need not be detailed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bundy suggested that in view of the importance of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s this could be used as an example in order to avoid
                        possible implications that <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s were no
                        longer a part of the freeze.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked whether the
                        inspections were not so arduous that the Soviets would never accept them.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> explained that while
                        inspection was quite detailed, it was very much less than that which existed
                        for <gloss target="#t_GCD1">GCD</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> explained his reasons for recommending the inclusion
                        of the sentence on launcher inspection (Page 11). He felt that without it
                        the right to inspect existing launchers for unauthorized improvements would
                        be foreclosed. He also suggested the deletion of the clause, “yet at the
                        same time unnecessarily intrusive,” at the end of the last paragraph on Page
                            14.<note n="5" xml:id="d40fn5">The full text of this paragraph is as
                            follows: “The U.S. believes that an inspection arrangement of the type I
                            have just described, together with such additional procedures as might
                            be required, would afford adequate assurance of compliance with the
                            proposed freeze on strategic nuclear vehicles and yet at the same time
                            not be unnecessarily intrusive.”</note> He felt it would be difficult to
                            <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0125"/>justify or misleading to indicate
                        that the type of inspection required would not be intrusive to the Soviets.
                        He further observed that there had been in the past considerable criticism
                        of inspection systems which observed the removal of things, but did not
                        inspect the remainders. He further agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> on the need for an introductory
                        paragraph. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> observed that
                        the purpose of the “intrusive” phrase was to try to bring the Soviets along
                        on this inspection and that indeed the inspection was very much less
                        intrusive than that required for GCD. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested that perhaps the language might be changed to
                        draw the comparison with GCD, and this was agreed upon.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> also wondered whether
                        the language was adequate to provide protection against inspection of
                        sensitive installations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>
                        read the sections on Pages 13 and 14, and indicated that he believed this
                        adequately covered the problem which would be admittedly difficult. He felt
                        that the situation would be adequate to guard against significant
                        violations. Some discussion ensued on what violations would be significant,
                        but it was agreed that this was a very complicated problem and could not be
                        resolved at this time. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> expressed a desire not to foreclose at this time on
                        this subject or on the numbers and types of inspections required. Mr. Bundy
                        agreed that the paper should remain loose and said he felt that it was just
                        about right at the present time. He felt that it was important to present it
                        at this time at Geneva since this had been one of the key points in the
                        President's position.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> requested
                        clarification on why it was proposed to change the phrasing on additional
                        procedures in Paragraph 1, Page 14.<note n="6" xml:id="d40fn6">This
                            paragraph related to procedures for withdrawal from a treaty covering a
                            freeze on strategic nuclear vehicles.</note> He preferred the original
                        wording. Although State had proposed this change, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he had no objection to going back
                        to the old wording and all concurred. With these changes it was agreed that
                        the paper would be suitable for presentation at Geneva at an early date.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other Business</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> observed that he was
                        worried about the procedures involved in handling the collateral or partial
                        measures. The negotiation of large numbers of treaties with all the
                        complications of developing precise and agreed language and the clearing of
                        these treaties through the Government and the Senate were very cumbersome
                        and time-consuming. He thought we should look at other alternatives such as
                        a possible Arms Commission under the Security Council which would keep a
                        roster of information on the armed forces of all countries. This Commission
                        could keep everyone informed and might make it easier to achieve arms <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0126"/>reductions by unilateral decisions.
                        Such decisions would be less binding and, therefore, perhaps not require
                        elaborate control mechanisms. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> observed that this was the general direction in which we
                        were presently going and quoted the examples of the bombs in orbit
                        resolution, budget reduction, and the fissionable material cutback. He felt
                        that the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> still served a very useful
                        purpose even in these types of arrangements and he would not like to see
                        this abandoned.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> felt that it was
                        desirable to develop some machinery which would get the smaller nations
                        involved in arms control since almost all the arms control activity involved
                        only the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> indicated that this had resulted
                        from the criticality of the nuclear forces in the present age, but agreed
                        that other areas were important. He agreed that we should explore this other
                        approach. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> agreed that the
                        small nation problem was extremely worrisome and could precipitate all of us
                        into war.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> informed the group that he
                        had prepared a paper on non-dissemination<note n="7" xml:id="d40fn7">Entitled, “Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons,” this draft position

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> informed the group that
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> had requested permission
                        to tell <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> on his forthcoming
                        visit that we would never give up the veto on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.<note n="9" xml:id="d40fn9">British Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> had several talks with

                            27-August 1. Using reports not yet approved by <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName>, Richard Faber, British First
                            Secretary, summarized these talks in a conversation with Richard Freund,
                            Deputy Assistant Director, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>/IR. In
                            his talk with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on July 29,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> said that his
                            government would not take part in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> without a veto on the use of weapons nor if it thought the
                                <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would be provocative to the
                            Soviets. After <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied
                            with a tirade against Germany, <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> “reiterated that Britain would retain a veto on the
                            use of nuclear weapons and that the control arrangements could not be

                        giving the reverse impression. He felt that a number of Government people
                        were encouraging the idea of giving up the veto either by leaks or in
                        private conversations. He thought this was very bad and would be a great
                        disservice to the success of many of our programs and our policies, and even
                        to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> itself. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agreed and said he would pass these
                        instructions on to his staff. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> indicated that in the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> paper it was attempted to develop a language <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0127"/>which would “waffle” the situation, by
                        referring to no increase in the number of independent entities having
                        control over nuclear weapons. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had some doubts on the desirability of any language
                        at this time. He stated that he had made it clear to various European
                        leaders, and believed Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        had done likewise, that when the day came that European nations could have
                        an independent nuclear force it would be the day that the U.S. would remove
                        its five divisions from Europe. He had discussed this with Von Hassel and he
                        did not feel there was any great pressure from the German side for this
                            control.<note n="11" xml:id="d40fn11">Reference is apparently to

                            approved paper at the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting on
                            August 27. Text in <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament,
                            1964</hi>, pp. 367-373. Timberlake's statement was identical to the text of
                            the July 9 paper cited in footnote 3 above except for a few sentences
                            and an added opening and final paragraph.</note> The other subjects
                        which had been agreed for discussion as a part of the collateral measures
                        were non-dissemination, fissionable materials cutoff, budget and bomber
                        destruction. He had suggested termination for the present session early in
                        September to permit smaller countries to prepare for the UN meeting in the
                        fall and to avoid unprofitable discussions during the pre-election period.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> wondered whether we
                        could not raise the topic of arms control in other countries than the U.S.
                        and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, perhaps initially in private
                        discussions with the Soviets. Mr. Bundy indicated that this should be
                        handled with great care since it was potentially explosive. It was agreed
                        that the matter would be studied.</p>
                    <p>The meeting was adjourned at 9 a.m.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Other Business</p>
                    <p>a. It was agreed, on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s
                        suggestion, that studies be made of other modes of handling arms control
                        negotiations which might facilitate unilateral measures not requiring
                        treaties and which might increase attention toward arms control by nations
                        other than the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Any
                        international discussions of this should be handled with great care.</p>
                    <p>b. Announcement was made by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>
                        that a new non-dissemination paper, based on the discussions at the 16 June
                        meeting, would be shortly distributed on a limited basis to the Principals.
                        It was also agreed that it would have been inappropriate for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> to have given <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0129"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> assurances that the veto

                        However, statements should not be made on any basis which would imply that
                        the veto would be given up. A radical change in U.S.-European relationships
                        would occur if the Europeans had an independent nuclear force.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked two preliminary
                        questions: first, whether, barring unforeseen developments such as possibly
                        might occur in the Far East could one foresee the shape of next year's
                        military budget? (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        replied the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> budget would be about the
                        same as this year's and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJG2">Palfrey</persName>
                        said the same applied with respect to <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>);
                        secondly, what are the Soviets doing about expenditures, are they reducing?
                        (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> replied they were not.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> continued that he had a
                        summary to read from which shows that Soviet public statements and actions
                        in this field are contradictory. It appears that the Soviets are engaging in
                        a dynamic expansion of their weapons program by steps such as the following:
                        testing of the new <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> types and launch
                        systems; continued expansion of fissionable <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0130"/>materials capacity, including new reactors; construction of
                        fourteen large reactors; increase up to thirty, of the number of nuclear
                        submarines, and conversion of old submarines; expansion of aircraft plants.
                        In summary, this was not a crash program but a consistently expanding one,
                        despite public statements designed to mislead world opinion. In reply to a
                        question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said his
                        statement was based on a study which had just been prepared by a special
                        group and general distribution had not been made.<note n="4" xml:id="d42fn4">This study has not been further identified.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> generally agreed
                        with the substance of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s
                        report but said its significance depended to some extent on interpretation.
                        The facts are not new; the Soviets are building new missiles, including
                        Polaris types, are engaged in hardening of sites, etc. It was obvious that
                        the Soviets are trying to strengthen their position, faced as they are with
                        U.S. overall superiority. On the other hand, economic pressures may be
                        working on them to reduce expenditures. We should try to lead them toward
                        this objective but Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> doubted whether this could be done by a public
                        statement of the kind envisaged which he felt might have unfavorable effects
                        on Vietnam, our European allies, etc.</p>
                    <p>In reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s question
                        regarding the two plutonium reactors which the Soviets said they would not
                            complete,<note n="5" xml:id="d42fn5">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s statement in his April 17
                            message to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and
                            repeated publicly in his April 20 statement that the Soviet Union was
                            stopping construction of two large plutonium reactors. See <ref target="#d23">Documents 23</ref> and <ref target="#d24">24</ref>,
                            respectively.</note> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                            not declassified</hi>]. It was possible, of course, that they may have
                        decreased by that number the new reactors they plan to build. If two were
                        actually shut down, they would probably be earlier types.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> thought it would be
                        valuable to obtain more knowledge about Soviet military expenditures and an
                        attempt to secure records would be useful. The question is, and the answer
                        would seem to be affirmative, whether it would be advantageous to the U.S.
                        to have a commitment from the Soviets, proceeding from the Geneva
                        discussions, to reduce their military expenditures. A statement along the
                        lines proposed might have a good effect on the smaller nations, might
                        furnish the Soviets an opportunity to make reductions, strengthening their
                        hand in their dispute with the Chinese communists. Some kind of
                        understanding on how to deal with budgets was probably the only hopeful area
                        for progress at this session of the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>.
                        Essentially the decision before the Committee of Principals was a political
                        one and it should be examined in the light of a balance between potential
                        advantage and disadvantage to the U.S. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> informed the Committee that he intended to return to
                        Geneva during the first week of September for the remainder of the session
                        which is due to end September 17.</p>
                    <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0131"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> thought that paragraphs
                        5 and 6 of the draft statement offered the best possibilities and were the
                        only things really requiring agreement.<note n="6" xml:id="d42fn6">Paragraph
                            5 called for a joint statement on the technical questions involved in
                            establishing commonly understood budgetary procedures. Paragraph 6 was a
                            recommendation to the U.N. Assembly that all nations submit to the U.N.
                            Secretary-General annual reports on their actual military expenditures
                            for the preceding year, planned military expenditures for the following
                            year, and supplementary data to permit evaluations of the scope of and
                            changes in expenditures devoted to the military effort.</note> We favor
                        these ideas, the Soviets do not. As regards paragraph 6, we make this
                        information public anyway and perhaps we should try to get the principle
                        accepted as a minimum; later we might examine other avenues. We should not
                        “express satisfaction” with Soviet budgetary announcements, since we don't
                        know their meaning.<note n="7" xml:id="d42fn7">An apparent reference to
                            paragraph 2 of the draft joint statement: “An expression of satisfaction
                            at the announcement by the Soviet Union and the United States of
                            reductions in their current military budgets.”</note> Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested the Committee
                        approve paragraphs 5 and 6 which could be set forth in a speech and might
                        lead to the setting up of a useful technical mechanism for the examination
                        of budgets.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bundy was reluctant to encourage disclosure beyond existing budgets since
                        we would not wish to give supplementary information in some fields.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> pointed out our foreign
                        military aid programs were mostly public knowledge; we should try to engage
                        the smaller countries in doing something about disarmament. Among the
                        non-aligned Eight at Geneva, Mexico was probably the most sincere since many
                        of the others were expanding their military establishments. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> approved paragraphs 5
                        and 6 but opposed any suggestion there should be a mandatory reduction.</p>
                    <p>In reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s question
                        whether a revision of the paragraphs preceding 5 and 6 in the draft
                        statement might be acceptable, Mr. Bundy expressed doubt about the
                        usefulness of a statement. Reductions were important but the suggested
                        timing and place for a statement of this kind seemed inappropriate. As
                        regards the reported feeling of malaise among the non-aligned at Geneva,
                        this might possibly be confined to the delegates only and might not apply to
                        their Governments as such. Since it might merely be a question of personal
                        feelings, the matter did not seem to be of major substantive importance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said a statement might
                        benefit the work of the Geneva conference. At any rate, the Soviets had
                        shown some interest, even though we had been unsuccessful in obtaining their
                        agreement to a technical working group on budgetary matters. An
                        understanding at Geneva might be helpful in easing tensions which could
                        arise in the General Assembly and among the Africans with respect to
                        difficult questions such as non-dissemination, <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, etc. It might be possible to avoid the <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0132"/>bad effects which a statement on budgets
                        might produce on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. In any event, we
                        should not let the decision as to whether a statement was useful or not go
                        by default.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> indicated the Committee
                        could agree on something along the lines of paragraphs 5 and 6 as the basis
                        for a statement at Geneva which could be helpful in mitigating crisis
                        tensions. The statement should not exaggerate the limited progress achieved
                        but could expand on the objectives we are seeking through our disarmament
                        discussions.</p>

                    <p rend="center">NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS </p>
                    <p rend="center">I. The Problem</p>
                    <p>Our current estimate is that there could be a test of a Chinese Communist
                        nuclear device at any time, but that it may not occur until late 1964 or
                        early 1965. This estimate is being reviewed now but is still considered
                        valid.</p>
                    <p>There are today at least three or four states in addition to the nuclear
                        powers which could make a national decision to produce nuclear weapons with
                        assurance that they have the national capability to support this decision.
                        This number will increase as nuclear technology continues to develop
                        throughout the world, as it becomes increasingly feasible to use
                        manufacturing techniques amenable to clandestine operations, and as large
                        nuclear power reactors are placed throughout the world producing thousands
                        of kilograms of plutonium annually.</p>
                    <p>The detonation of a nuclear device by the Chinese Communists will place great
                        pressure on these countries to make a national decision to develop nuclear
                        weapons in some cases for reasons of security, and in other cases for
                        reasons of prestige. Because of regional rivalries a national decision by
                        any of these countries may force other countries perhaps technically less
                        qualified to make a similar national decision to engage in an all-out effort
                        to acquire nuclear weapons either by development or by other means. Once
                        this process starts it may be impossible to halt.</p>
                    <p>The problem <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0134"/>which faces the United
                        States is how to prevent it from starting—how to develop political
                        inhibitions against the development of further national nuclear capabilities
                        which are sufficiently strong to stand the shock of a Communist Chinese
                        nuclear detonation. The problem which faces the United States is how to
                        develop these political inhibitions against the development of further
                        national nuclear capabilities within the limited period of time available to
                        us. If we do not solve this problem—either because of mistake or because of
                        delay—we will soon be faced with a world in which there are ten and then
                        possibly twenty states having national nuclear capabilities. This would be a
                        world of the greatest danger and insecurity.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II. The United States Position</p>
                    <p>1. The United States should intensify its program to prevent the
                        proliferation of national nuclear weapons capabilities which should include
                        the following lines of action, which are mutually reinforcing and should be
                        pursued in parallel. They should include: </p>
                    <p>(a) efforts to discourage individual states from embarking on nuclear weapons
                        programs;</p>
                    <p>(b) efforts to impede the spread of the technical capabilities required for
                        the development and production of nuclear weapons;</p>
                    <p>(c) efforts to negotiate with the Soviet Union a nuclear non-proliferation
                        agreement open to accession of all states; and</p>
                    <p>(d) efforts to develop the widest possible political consensus favorable to
                        such a non-proliferation agreement which will make a national decision to
                        acquire a nuclear capability more difficult even before such an agreement
                        comes into effect.</p>
                    <p>2. With respect to our efforts to discourage individual states from embarking
                        on nuclear weapons programs we should examine on a case-by-case basis the
                        feasibility and desirability of bringing appropriate arguments, pressures
                        and inducements to bear on countries which are estimated to have both the
                        technical capability and a strong incentive to manufacture, or otherwise
                        acquire control of, nuclear weapons. Where legitimate security concerns may
                        represent a principal source of the incentive to acquire nuclear weapons,
                        the usefulness of security arrangements or guarantees, in which the United
                        States might participate or assist, should be given special consideration.
                        Consistent with the foregoing we should:</p>
                    <p>(a) accord high priority to the development of an approach to the problem of
                        the possible acquisition of nuclear weapons by India; and</p>
                    <p>(b) develop approaches in the case of additional countries determined to
                        warrant such consideration.</p>
                    <p>3. With respect to efforts to impede the spread of technical capabilities
                        required for development and production of nuclear weapons, we should
                        undertake the following courses of action.</p>
                    <p>(a) We should consider arrangements among major suppliers of nuclear
                        materials and equipment to permit exports to only those nations <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0135"/>prepared to accept adequate safeguards. We
                        should not limit our consideration of this problem to formal agreements
                        offered in arms control and disarmament negotiations.</p>
                    <p>(b) We should seek to strengthen arrangements to prevent or delay the
                        dissemination of relevant technology, including such developments as the
                        gas-centrifuge process.</p>
                    <p>(c) We should continue our efforts to strengthen the capabilities of the
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> to assure the use of fissionable
                        material for peaceful purposes only and continue our efforts to win
                        acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.</p>
                    <p>4. The U.S. should continue its efforts to negotiate, initially with the
                        Soviet Union, a nuclear non-proliferation agreement. A revised text to be
                        used for this purpose is attached as Annex A.</p>
                    <p>(a) As a government, we recognize that no agreement with the Soviet Union on
                        non-proliferation would be possible in the foreseeable future were we to
                        make inclusion of the Chinese Communists a precondition. The U.S. should
                        refrain from raising the question of whether Communist China must be a party
                        to a non-proliferation agreement. If the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> asks for our views on this matter, we should state that
                        Communist China in our view should be a participant in any such agreement
                        both because of the problem of India and because of the desirability of
                        having the agreement world-wide in scope. We should not indicate that we
                        consider Soviet acceptance of this view a precondition to further
                        discussions of the subject. We should indicate that we are prepared to defer
                        consideration of this problem until we have completed the discussion of
                        other aspects of the agreement.</p>
                    <p>(b) In order to increase the negotiability of the non-proliferation agreement
                        by lessening the implication that Soviet acceptance of the U.S. text would
                        constitute Soviet endorsement of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, a
                        letter to the Soviet Government (attached as Annex B)<note n="2" xml:id="d44fn2">Not printed.</note> should be used in place of the
                        earlier U.S. draft minute for the purpose of giving reassurance with respect
                        to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> at the time of the conclusion of
                        a non-proliferation agreement. The U.S. should give in the draft letter
                        (final paragraph of Annex B) an assurance that the “European clause” of the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> Charter would not be used to
                        increase the number of independent decision-making entities controlling the
                        use of nuclear weapons. The U.S. should support and encourage appropriate
                        efforts which may develop among participants in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> to register a commitment on non-acquisition in connection
                        with adherence to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>(c) In discussing a non-proliferation agreement with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the U.S. should suggest that a
                        willingness to accept International Atomic Energy Agency or similar
                        international safeguards on peaceful nuclear <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0136"/>activities of states not presently possessing nuclear
                        weapons should preferably be made a part of the agreement. However, the U.S.
                        should be prepared to adhere to the position already made known to the
                        Soviets and accept an agreement without such international safeguard
                        provisions if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> rejects such
                        provisions.</p>
                    <p>5. The U.S. should continue its efforts to develop the widest possible
                        political consensus favorable to a non-proliferation agreement, and thus
                        make more difficult prior to such an agreement any national decision to

                        member states declared their willingness to undertake in an international
                        treaty “not to manufacture or acquire control of nuclear weapons,” and
                        called upon “all peace-loving nations to adhere to the same undertaking”
                        should be used as a vehicle to obtain such a consensus by the following line
                        of action:</p>
                    <p>(a) By means of private consultation with selected <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> member states at appropriate times, the U.S. should urge
                        preparation of language for a draft U.N. resolution and a draft treaty which
                        does not conflict with the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, U.S. transit
                        rights, or other U.S. objectives, so as to assure that the proposed
                        resolution and treaty could be supported by the U.S. and its allies when the
                        disarmament discussions resume in the U.N.G.A.</p>
                    <p>(b) The United States should review the question of the desirability of the
                        international conference called for in the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> resolution and should also consider other means of developing
                        the treaty called for if a conference is determined not to be in the best
                        interests of the United States.</p>
                    <p>(c) We should continue to state publicly, at appropriate times, that we
                        welcome the basic objectives of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>
                        resolution as a valuable step toward such a consensus, and we should quietly
                        encourage other states to associate themselves with the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> resolution.</p>

                    <p>A. Efforts to Discourage Individual States from Embarking on a Nuclear
                        Weapons Program.</p>
                    <p>At the present time Israel, India, Sweden, Japan and the Federal Republic of
                        Germany have the technical capability to support a national decision to
                        produce nuclear weapons. The development of a national nuclear weapons
                        capability by any one of these countries would exacerbate international
                        tensions and tend to induce additional states to follow suit.</p>
                    <p>At the present time the United States has an on-going program to deal with
                        the possible acquisition of nuclear weapons by Israel and with the broader
                        aspects of the Middle East arms race. The U.S. should, of course, continue
                        this program. It also should expand it, on a case-by-case <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0137"/>basis, to discourage other states from
                        embarking on nuclear weapons programs. It should do so at a level of urgency
                        commensurate with the need to develop political inhibitions against the
                        development of further national nuclear capabilities sufficiently strong to
                        stand the shock of a Chinese Communist nuclear detonation. It should
                        consider, where feasible, the desirability of security arrangements, in
                        which the U.S. participates or assists, where legitimate security concerns
                        may represent a principal source of the incentive to acquire nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>In considering tactics and timing—in gauging the sense of urgency required—it
                        must also be recognized that the estimates as to when these various
                        countries could detonate a nuclear device is not a true measure of the time
                        available to us. The critical time is the time of national decision to
                        develop nuclear weapons. This could be made very soon by any of three or
                        four governments, with confidence that they have the technical capabilities
                        to back it up. Once made, such a decision may be hard to change, even though
                        the actual nuclear detonation may not occur for some period of time
                        afterwards.</p>
                    <p>In considering such an expanded program, high priority should be given to the
                        problem of the possible acquisition of nuclear weapons by India. The
                        detonation of a Chinese Communist nuclear device will put great pressure on
                        India to make a national decision to develop nuclear weapons of its own. The
                        development of nuclear weapons by India would be a serious—perhaps
                        irreparable—break in the political and psychological barrier which now
                        restrains proliferation. The U.S. should make every effort to prevent such a
                        development, including the consideration of the possibility of appropriate
                        security arrangements.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. should also consider developing approaches with respect to the other
                        countries which have been mentioned. In considering such an expanded program
                        there must be recognition of the fact that, in several key states, the
                        success of such bilateral efforts may depend upon parallel progress toward a
                        non-proliferation agreement open to accession by all states, and the
                        attitude of the United States concerning the creation of additional centers
                        of decision over nuclear weapons in the context of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. Looking at the other side of the coin, the
                        success or failure of our efforts to prevent other countries from developing
                        national nuclear capabilities will also have a direct bearing on the success
                        or failure of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. If the political and
                        psychological barrier which now restrains proliferation is broken down, the
                        objectives of our <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> policy will be
                        seriously threatened. For example, should India, Israel, Japan, or Sweden
                        acquire an independent nuclear capability, the Federal Republic would
                        probably come to feel that it had accepted second-class status in limiting
                        its nuclear power to that provided by the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Efforts to Impede the Technical Capabilities
                        Required for Development and Production of Nuclear Weapons.</p>
                    <p>Efforts to impede the spread of the technical capabilities required for the
                        development of production of nuclear weapons systems cannot be a substitute
                        for the political approaches to prevent national decision to develop nuclear
                        weapons outlined in the other portions of this paper. As indicated earlier
                        in this discussion there are already at least five countries (apart from
                        China) which now have the technical capabilities to support a decision to
                        develop a nuclear weapons capability. Moreover, the problem of developing a
                        modern delivery capability daily appears less of an inhibition on any
                        decision of an industrialized nation to seek a nuclear capability.</p>
                    <p>Effort to impede these technical capabilities is necessary to keep the
                        political problem one of manageable proportions. A political program of the
                        type outlined in the preceding and succeeding portions of this paper may be
                        manageable if it has to cope primarily with the five countries mentioned. It
                        would be infinitely more difficult, if not impossible, if the number is
                        increased to fifteen. For example, there will soon be many countries with
                        nuclear power reactors producing thousands of kilograms of plutonium per
                        year. If some form of action is not taken to prevent the diversion of this
                        plutonium to weapons, it will be almost impossible to bring this problem
                        under control. </p>
                    <p>It is for this reason that the political program outlined in the other
                        portions of this paper must be accompanied by continuing efforts to impede
                        the spread of the technical capabilities required for the development and
                        production of nuclear weapons systems. These measures should include
                        continued efforts to strengthen the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>,
                        the consideration of an arrangement among major suppliers of nuclear
                        materials to limit export to those nations prepared to accept adequate
                        safeguards and a consideration of ways to impede dissemination of relevant
                        technology.</p>

                    <p rend="center">
                        <hi rend="italic">(1) Participation by Communist China</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The reopening of discussions with the Soviet Union on the question of a
                        non-proliferation agreement emphasizes the question of the participation of
                        Communist China in any such agreement. Communist China will almost certainly
                        refuse to adhere to any nuclear non-acquisition agreement. At the present
                        time, therefore, the United States cannot continue to insist on Chinese
                        adherence without foreclosing all opportunities for achieving such an
                        agreement. The Soviets are also aware of this, and it would not be in the
                        interests of the United States to indicate to them that we are not really
                        interested in such an agreement at the present time.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, we should not delay our efforts to work out a multilateral
                        agreement as part of our overall efforts to curb the spread of nuclear <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0139"/>weapons to other countries, such as
                        Israel, Sweden, India, and Germany, until the Chinese problem is settled.
                        The further proliferation of nuclear weapons throughout the world would not
                        alleviate the problems raised by a Communist Chinese nuclear detonation.
                        Even if the Chinese were to develop a nuclear capability, a world of five
                        nuclear powers would be far preferable to a world of ten or twenty.</p>
                    <p>One useful contribution of an agreement, even if it did not include Communist
                        China, would be to isolate China still further in world opinion, and to
                        undercut Chinese efforts to develop friendly relations among the
                        less-developed countries of the world. Moreover, the agreement would
                        strengthen the Soviets' hand in maintaining their non-assistance policy with
                        respect to Communist China, regardless of any changes which might occur in
                        their relations with the Chinese Communist leadership.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of negotiating tactics, it would be unwise for the United States
                        to take an initiative in indicating it is dropping its prior requirement of
                        Chinese Communist participation. It would be preferable for the United
                        States merely not to raise this subject when the problem of
                        non-proliferation is next raised with the Soviets. If the Soviets raise the
                        issue of Chinese participation, we could restate our position that Chinese
                        Communists should participate, indicate that we do not consider this a
                        precondition for continuation of discussions of a non-proliferation
                        agreement and state that the question should be deferred until we have
                        reached an understanding on other provisions of such an agreement. If we
                        should be able to come to a satisfactory understanding on all other
                        provisions of a non-proliferation agreement, we would then consult with our
                        allies on the issue of Chinese Communist participation.</p>

                        </hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>For more than a year, the United States has been trying to persuade the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to accept a non-proliferation
                        agreement. The <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> has been cited by the
                        Soviets as the only obstacle to reaching such an agreement. In attempting to
                        persuade the Soviets to accept our language regarding non-proliferation to
                        the national control of other states, the U.S. has stressed the argument
                        that such an agreement will give further assurance that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> will not in fact become a device through
                        which Germany could acquire such control. We have thus confronted the
                        Soviets with the dilemma of either accepting such language or seeing the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> come into being with no commitment
                        of this kind to limit its evolution.</p>
                    <p>The procedure which we have followed so far of using a minute to set forth
                        our views on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> has one element of
                        difficulty. The non-proliferation agreement and minute which we have
                        proposed to the Soviet Union could be <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0140"/>interpreted by them as implicitly sanctioning the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. It is unlikely that they will enter into
                        any agreement which can be interpreted as having such effect, at least as
                        long as they have any hope that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> will
                        not come into existence.</p>
                    <p>The present procedure, therefore, may have inhibited any progress on a
                        non-proliferation agreement until there has been a final resolution of the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, if not for some time thereafter.
                        This would not be a serious disadvantage were it not for the possibility
                        that nuclear developments by other states might meanwhile progress to a
                        point which would not only cause a further break in the non-proliferation
                        dike, but, for the reasons indicated above, would probably make the Germans
                        unwilling to remain satisfied with the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.
                        The relevance of such developments to the urgency of a non-proliferation
                        agreement should be pointed out to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The proposed procedure of using a letter rather than a minute is designed to
                        make somewhat more likely Soviet acceptance of a non-proliferation
                        agreement, since the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not have to
                        agree expressly to our letter.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the U.S. letter (Annex B) contains an undertaking that if a
                        nuclear non-proliferation agreement is concluded the U.S. will not agree to
                        future arrangements that would increase the number of independent
                        decision-making entities controlling the use of nuclear weapons. The U.S.
                        should point out to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> that this
                        portion of the letter is intended to deal with the concern which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has expressed regarding possible future
                        evolution of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>This portion of the letter is along the lines of the assurances which
                        Netherlands Foreign Minister Luns, at our private suggestion, gave to
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> last June.<note n="3" xml:id="d44fn3">Luns met with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> on July 8, 1964, and on the following day
                            summarized their conversation in a meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy D. Kohler</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> then reported:</note> The

                        and how we should reveal our position. </p>
                    <p>“Luns said conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had focused primarily on Germany and <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. Discussion of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> took nearly half of ninety-minute meeting and was based on
                        Secretary's letter to Luns, content of which was incorporated in memo left
                        with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. Luns said <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> listened carefully, asked
                        pertinent questions and seemed impressed. Luns tried to establish the basis
                        by demonstrating that Dutch losses in World War II were comparable to Soviet
                        losses and that Dutch feeling with respect to proliferation of nuclear
                        weapons to Germany no less strong than those of Soviets. While <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s own remarks were consistent
                        with established and often-repeated Soviet opposition to <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, Luns feels there may be some chance for a
                        shift.” (Telegram 73 from Moscow, July 9; Johnson Library, National Security

                    <p>It has been argued that a clear U.S. acceptance of restraints now on the
                        evolution of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, as desired by the British,
                        would permit the British to gain their objectives without having to join,
                        and hence reduce the pressure on them to join. It is more likely that the
                        British decision will be governed <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0141"/>at the proper time by considerations broader than those of mere tactics
                        and will depend upon the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s judgment of its
                        basic interest in either joining or staying out. Since Britain's ultimate
                        participation in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is valuable to us,
                        it seems worth facilitating by agreeing, at this stage, to the position
                        which is recommended in this paper. This is particularly so since the basic
                        US position, whose final form has been set even now by the almost certain
                        insistence of Congress on restraints, is essentially the same as that of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Any delusion or vagueness contrived
                        for tactical purposes is not likely in the long run to enhance the
                        effectiveness of German or Italian participation in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Vagueness about our position on the evolution of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> will also handicap our efforts to dissuade India, Israel,
                        and other countries from embarking on nuclear weapons programs. As indicated
                        earlier, failure in these efforts may undercut the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as an alternative to German national nuclear capability.</p>
                    <p>An important consideration, moreover, is the possible effect of the proposed
                        undertaking on negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                        While the Soviets will continue to oppose the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> for a number of reasons, a large part of their stated concern
                        is the prospect that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is a step
                        toward acquisition of a nuclear capability by the FRG. If the Soviets, by
                        adhering to our proposed non-proliferation agreement, could obtain from the
                        U.S. a clear undertaking against such evolution, the Soviets might
                        reconsider their present negative position. Given increasing Soviet concern
                        about the spread of nuclear weapons to a number of countries, as well as
                        their incentive to find a new vehicle for isolating China in world opinion,
                        it is possible that the proposed undertaking would tip the balance, at least
                        to the extent of permitting resumption of serious negotiations on a
                        non-proliferation agreement. It might also make prompt agreement possible
                        once the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> issue had been resolved.</p>
                    <p>It is recommended that the U.S. support and encourage appropriate efforts
                        which may develop among participants in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> to register a commitment on non-acquisition in connection with
                        adherence to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>It must be recognized it may be difficult to ask, much less insist, that a
                        non-nuclear participant assume a formal non-acquisition obligation. The
                        Italian Government recently expressed reluctance to take such a step and the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has indicated it will not expand its
                        non-manufacture commitment beyond the <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>
                        countries and especially not to the Soviets, unless it receives some return
                        benefit. Something might nevertheless be accomplished by an approach such as
                        the following to non-nuclear prospective participants: they doubtless can be
                        persuaded to say they agree with us (and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> could hardly deny it) that non-dissemination is necessary; they
                        must be convinced, as the U.S. is convinced, that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> does not involve, but indeed obviates, the risk of
                        dissemination; while <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0142"/>they may feel
                        unable at this time to volunteer a formal undertaking, public statements by
                        authoritative officials acknowledging the foregoing points would support the
                        credibility of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> objectives. Furthermore,
                        since it has been shown the Soviets value associations with some <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries such as the Netherlands and the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, which have not yet decided to join
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, were those countries to make a
                        decision not to join <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> for reasons of
                        their own, they should be encouraged to state that they are of the firm
                        belief that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as such does not involve
                        dissemination of nuclear weapons.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The nuclear weapons non-manufacturing obligation should preferably include
                        verification provisions to provide assurance that non-nuclear powers are not
                        attempting to manufacture nuclear weapons. Such provisions should provide
                        for the acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> or similar
                        international safeguards against the diversion of fissionable material from
                        peaceful to military purposes.</p>
                    <p>If the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> provisions prove acceptable to
                        the members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the United States, in private
                        discussions with such <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> members as
                        India, Sweden, and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, should attempt
                        to persuade them to accept these provisions before the text of the draft
                        agreement becomes public knowledge.</p>
                    <p>In trying to persuade the non-nuclear states to accept such provisions, the
                        U.S. could point out that, since violations of the agreement would threaten
                        their own security more than the security of the nuclear powers,
                        international inspection would appear to be in their own self interest. </p>
                    <p>The U.S. could point out that <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards are important for the following reasons among others:</p>
                    <p>(a) From the point of view of proliferation, the construction of facilities
                        for the production of fissionable material constitutes the most critical
                        stage of the process of developing a nuclear weapons production capability.
                        It is relatively easy to detect construction of these facilities by
                        unilateral intelligence, considerably more so than the facilities used in
                        other portions of the weapons manufacturing process. Once the existence of
                        these production facilities is known, <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards are well suited to see that the products of these facilities are
                        used only for peaceful purposes.</p>
                    <p>(b) In the absence of safeguards, it would be difficult to distinguish this
                        critical stage from the construction of large-scale nuclear facilities for
                        peaceful purposes which many countries are now planning to build.</p>
                    <p>Several non-nuclear states would probably prefer to sign an agreement without
                        such verification. The U.S. should try to link verification with
                        non-proliferation in a single agreement, in order to obtain acceptance <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0143"/>of desirable verification
                        provisions by the largest possible number of states.</p>
                    <p>If it should prove impossible, however, to persuade these states to accept
                        the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> provisions, we should stand on the
                        position already made known to the Soviets. A non-proliferation agreement
                        without such provisions would serve U.S. interests better than no agreement
                        at all. The U.S. might also at that time consider the possibility of
                        presenting a separate <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards
                        agreement for adherence by those states willing to accept it.</p>

                        Favorable to Non-Proliferation: Response to <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> Resolution.</p>
                    <p>An essential element in a non-proliferation program is an attempt on a broad
                        multilateral basis to develop political inhibitions against the creation of
                        further national nuclear capabilities. This element is not present in either
                        our efforts to discourage individual states from embarking on nuclear
                        weapons programs or our efforts to negotiate with the Soviet Union
                        concerning a non-proliferation agreement.</p>
                    <p>As already indicated the attempts to persuade individual nations are
                        valuable. They should be continued and expanded. They cannot, however, take
                        advantage of the fact that, as shown by the limited test ban, regional
                        rivals may find it possible to agree to something in the context of an
                        agreement open to all states that they could not agree to just with each
                        other.</p>
                    <p>The negotiation with the Soviets is valuable and should continue. It is being
                        conducted primarily on a U.S.-U.S.S.R. basis with the thought that other
                        countries will be approached when agreement is reached. It is not certain,
                        however, that there will be agreement on the basis for such an approach to
                        other countries sufficiently soon to meet the urgency of the situation.</p>
                    <p>What must be guarded against is that while we (a) engage in private talks
                        with individual states on a state-by-state basis and (b) engage in private
                        discussions with the Soviets, we do not (c) fail to take the multilateral
                        steps which may be an essential part in our actions to develop a broad
                        political consensus favorable to non-proliferation which is sufficiently
                        strong to stand the shock of a Communist Chinese nuclear test.</p>
                    <p>The Irish Resolution was a step in developing such a consensus, but it was
                        adopted almost three years ago.<note n="4" xml:id="d44fn4">Reference is to
                            U.N. General Assembly Resolution 1665 (XVI) on the prevention of the

                            4, 1961. Text in <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1961</hi>,
                            p. 694.</note> The limited test ban had a similar effect. By banning
                        tests in the medium which might be the simplest for a country developing
                        nuclear weapons it represented a political decision <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0144"/>pointing away from such a development. But
                        it does permit tests which could be used by a country developing such a
                        weapon. Further steps to develop such a consensus therefore seem advisable.</p>
                    <p>One device which has been considered to develop such a consensus was an
                        attempt to seek broad international support for “declarations of intent”

                    <p>Perhaps an even better method would be in the nature of a response to the

                        member states to undertake in an international treaty “not to manufacture or
                        acquire control of nuclear weapons;” calls upon all nations to adhere to the
                        same undertaking; and calls upon all nuclear powers to respect and abide by
                        this declaration. It also invites the U.N. General Assembly to convene a
                        conference with a view to concluding a non-proliferation treaty.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the problems implicit in the call for a conference and the
                        undesirable references in the preamble, the body of this resolution states
                        its objective in terms which may make it possible for this resolution to be
                        used in developing a consensus in favor of a non-proliferation agreement
                        open to accession by all states and which would make it more difficult,
                        while such an agreement is being worked out, for other countries to make a
                        national decision to acquire a nuclear weapons capability. Private
                        consultation with selected <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> member
                        states, the preparation of a draft U.N. resolution and a draft treaty which

                        transit rights, and a statement that we welcome the objectives of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> resolution (together with quiet

                        toward developing such a consensus. Consideration should also be given to
                        having the draft resolution more than merely a call for an agreement but

                    <p>In late August 1964 Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        directed the establishment of a new committee, within the framework of the
                        Committee of Principals, to consider further steps that might be taken to
                        prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. He specified that <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Llewellyn Thompson</persName> would chair the new
                        committee, which would be composed of the Deputies of the Committee of
                        Principals, plus the Assistant Secretaries of State for European Affairs and
                        Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, and the Chairman <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0147"/>of the Policy Planning Council. In a
                        memorandum to the Committee of Principals, August 24, <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> explained the terms of reference of
                        this committee:</p>
                    <p>“The task of the Committee is to develop, on a priority basis, specific
                        recommendations for further action that should be taken by the U.S. to
                        prevent the further proliferation of national nuclear weapons capabilities.
                        These recommendations should be developed in the light of the possible early
                        detonation of a nuclear device by the Chinese Communists. Thus, particular
                        attention should be given to the course of action the U.S. should take with
                        respect to India. At the same time, however, consideration should be given
                        to further actions which might be taken, either bilaterally or on a
                        multilateral basis, with respect to the dangers posed by other potential
                        capabilities of Israel, Sweden, Japan, and possibly the Union of South
                        Africa. In developing recommendations consideration should include the way
                        in which the U.S. could meet, either bilaterally or multilaterally,
                        legitimate security concerns which may be a principal incentive to
                        acquisition of nuclear capability.” (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_RD2">RD</gloss> Files: Lot

                    <p>This Committee on Nuclear Weapons Capabilities, as it was soon called, held
                        its first meeting on August 28. Twenty-three officials, representing the

                        Department of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Atomic Energy Commission,

                        meeting. (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>Altogether, this interagency group held nine meetings from August 28,
                        1964-February 4, 1965. Discussions focused on general approaches to the
                        problem of inhibiting prohibition, the spread of nuclear and related
                        technology and the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency, possible
                        substantive initiatives on nonproliferation at the Eighteen-Nation

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> draft position paper marks a
                        substantial step forward, in my view, in placing greater emphasis than
                        heretofore on recommending a case-by-case consideration of the key
                        situations which could provide an undesirable trigger to proliferation.
                        Communist China represents a special problem and is being dealt with
                        separately. With respect to Germany, we have the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. Current efforts to deal with the Israel-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> situation offer our best hope for that
                        area. This paper notes, I believe correctly, the need to give high priority
                        to the Indian case. Our concrete programs for the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and to deal with the Israel-UAR arms race were developed by
                        careful consideration of local pressures and problems, and we believe
                        additional case-by-case studies as now recommended by <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> should be undertaken. Bill <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> has been in touch with me with the
                        suggestion that I chair a group to consider these various regional case
                        problems, and arrangements for this are going forward.</p>
                    <p>In several other respects, the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> paper
                        also contributes to advancing our tactical handling of the problem of
                        preventing proliferation, in particular by suggesting a letter (though not
                        the one <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> has <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0149"/>drafted) instead of a minute to express to
                        the Soviets our interpretation of the relation of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> to non-proliferation, and to suggest (but
                        not insist upon) specifying <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards
                        in a non-proliferation agreement with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. In view of Soviet opposition to reliance on <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards, it would not be desirable to
                        make this a required element of our position.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, I believe that the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                        paper raises three major problems: (1) decision not to insist on Chinese
                        Communist participation as a precondition to a non-proliferation agreement,
                        (2) decision now to place sharp constraints and conditions on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, and so to inform the Soviet leaders, and
                        (3) advocacy of an attempt to use the recent <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> resolution on non-proliferation as a vehicle to open a new
                        campaign for a world-wide agreement. I, and the other interested officers in
                        the Department, have grave reservations on the conclusions of the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> discussion, and oppose several
                        recommendations made in the paper. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Should we decide now to accept an agreement
                        without Communist China?</p>
                    <p>I believe that if we are able to agree upon a satisfactory non-proliferation
                        agreement, we should probably accept it even without adherence of Communist
                        China. I see no way to induce or compel Chinese commitment to forego
                        acquisition of what they regard as an essential symbol, as well as
                        instrument, of great power status. However, I strongly question the
                        advisability of making that decision at this time. Even if, as <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposes, we would not at once disclose
                        such a position to the Soviets, I am much inclined to believe it would
                        become known to our Allies, some of whom would be greatly alarmed at our
                        giving up this card while pressing them to accept such an agreement.
                        Similarly, India at least would probably be disinclined to adhere to such an
                        agreement without Chinese commitment, and premature Indian realization of
                        our position accepting an agreement without China could adversely affect our
                        efforts to restrain India from initiating its own nuclear weapons program.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, as a clarification and alternative to the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> draft, we would propose adopting at this
                        time the following US position:</p>
                    <p>(a) If the Soviet Union should prove willing to accept a non-proliferation
                        agreement on terms acceptable to ourselves and our Allies, we should, at
                        that time and in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, consider
                        the question of whether we should enter into such an agreement without the
                        participation of Communist China. </p>
                    <p>(b) If, at the time the US and the Soviet Union reach agreement, other
                        countries should hesitate to adhere to the agreement without the
                        participation of Communist China or other particular countries, we should
                        consider the usefulness of their issuing declarations of intent to adhere at
                        such time as the adherence of other necessary parties may take place.</p>
                    <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0150"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">2. Should we offer the Soviet Union, in connection with a
                            non-proliferation agreement, a commitment that we will not allow the
                                <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> control formula to evolve in a
                            way that would increase the number of nuclear decision-making
                        centers?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is highly unlikely that the US would or should give up a decisive voice in
                        the control of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> unless this step
                        involved abandonment of at least one of the existing European national
                        deterrent forces and thereby had the effect of not increasing (or possibly
                        of reducing) the number of “powers” controlling the use of nuclear weapons.
                        But freezing our position now and offering a formal commitment to the Soviet
                        Union on this score would damage important US interests without increasing
                        the likelihood of early Soviet acceptance of a non-proliferation agreement.</p>
                    <p>The question of the “review clause” of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> Charter is one of the most sensitive issues confronting
                        participants in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, including the US.
                        To make this issue the subject of negotiations with the Soviet Union, as
                            <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> suggests, would present severe
                        substantive difficulties reaching beyond the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and affecting our basic position in Europe, and the timing of
                            <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>'s proposal could not be worse.
                        Taking both substance and timing into account, adoption of the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal would have the following adverse
                        effects:</p>
                    <p>(a) It would lead to a deepening crisis of confidence in our relations with
                        West Germany (the more so in view of the aide mémoire left by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> with me on August 5,
                        which expressed concern about the handling of the non-proliferation question
                        at the Geneva Conference and which forecast difficulties in the forthcoming
                        General Assembly).<note n="6" xml:id="d46fn6">The German aide-mémoire,
                            August 5, expressed “great concern” about the Eighteen-Nation
                            Disarmament Committee discussions, which “are increasingly used by the
                            Soviets to attack the policies followed by the Federal Republic and the
                            creation of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.” The Germans felt
                            the discussions were being “exploited by the Soviets as a welcome means
                            to discredit us in the eyes of the world and especially in those of the
                            uncommitted countries represented at Geneva.” It further asked the U.S.
                            Delegate in Geneva to avoid the subject of nonproliferation if possible
                            and to consult with the Federal Republic of Germany in anticipation of
                            future attacks that the Soviets would launch against the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> in the United Nations. In a memorandum
                            of conversation between <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Llewellyn
                            Thompson</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName>, August 5, attached to the aide-mémoire,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said that he did not
                            expect further discussion of nonproliferation at the current session of
                            the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee and gave assurances that the
                            United States would continue to respond to Soviet attacks on the Federal
                            Republic and the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and would consult
                            with his government on the nonproliferation issue in the U.N. General
                            Assembly. (Department of State, Central Files, DEF 18)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>(b) It would create a first-rate opportunity (which would not be lost) for
                        the Gaullists in Germany as well as France to step up criticism of US policy
                        in general. They would argue that the US was selling out European interests
                        in dealing with the Soviet Union over the heads of the <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0151"/>Europeans; that the US had, in effect,
                        disowned assurances which had been given by both Presidents Kennedy and
                        Johnson about possible evolution in <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        control as Europe moves toward unity; and that Germany should turn away from
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and cooperate with a force “that is
                        really at Europe's disposition”—the force de frappe. All of this would
                        weaken Erhard in his effort to fight off external and domestic pressures to
                        abandon an “Atlanticist” outlook, in favor of narrow Franco-German
                        collaboration.</p>
                    <p>(c) While disturbing our relations with West Germany, the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal would, evidently, not satisfy
                        the British. As you know, the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal
                        is patterned after a suggestion initially put forward by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Delegation to the Geneva Conference and
                        subsequently, in effect, disowned by the Foreign Office after implications
                        for continuation of the British national deterrent were realized. To advance
                        the language now suggested by <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> would
                        catapult the question of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> control and its
                        relation to the British national deterrent into the British electoral
                        campaign, by making it appear that the US contemplated that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would eventually absorb the British force.
                        (This may be a desirable objective from our standpoint, but the way to
                        achieve it is not by making it a partisan issue in the British election.)</p>
                    <p>(d) From the standpoint of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> control
                        issue itself, the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal would be
                        counterproductive. It would be strongly resented by such “Europeanists” as
                        Jean Monnet and his Action Committee who, while not pressing for abandonment
                        of the US veto, set great store on not precluding this possibility—if only
                        to make it clear that their acceptance of joint US-European control is not
                        the result of US pressures. The net result would be a revival of European
                        pressures for abandonment of the US veto since the recent decline in these
                        pressures (manifest in statements by Von Hassel, Monnet, and others) was
                        partly due to a belief by the Europeans that they would be able to consider
                        the issue on its merits, instead of having the answer dictated to them by
                        the US.</p>
                    <p>(e) Adoption of the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal might
                        divert and disrupt the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> drafting exercise
                        in Paris at a time when we are trying to bring this exercise—one of the few
                        constructive ventures we now have going in Europe—to a successful conclusion
                        by the end of the year so that the governments concerned can then reach the
                        necessary decisions in a final negotiation.</p>
                    <p>(f) Finally, while we can probably agree to a withdrawal clause in a
                        non-proliferation agreement along the lines suggested, it would be
                        undesirable to give the Soviets now a club to wield over the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> prior to its ratification.</p>
                    <p>While incurring the liabilities noted above, the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal would not be likely to achieve its objective of
                        hastening Soviet acceptance of a non-proliferation agreement. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>'s assessment <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0152"/>(which I share, and which <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> also shares) is that, as long as the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is in the formative stage, the Soviet Union
                        will reject any non-proliferation agreement that does not bar the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. Past experience with the Soviet Union
                        supports this conclusion, and the price of again confirming this experience
                        by putting forward the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal is
                        prohibitively high for the reasons that have been presented.</p>
                    <p>As an alternative to the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal, we
                        recommend the following:</p>
                    <p>(a) As specific <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> arrangements emerge from
                        the Paris discussions, we recommend further talks between you and Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> to clear up any Soviet
                        misunderstandings of these arrangements. This would be in line with your
                        previous assurance to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that
                        many Soviet concerns would be met when details respecting the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> became available.</p>
                    <p>(b) Continuing assurances should be given the Soviet Union that we will not
                        permit the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> to fall into the hands of any
                        single country or of any grouping in which a single European country was
                        predominant.</p>
                    <p>(c) Later in the year, when the time comes for European governments to adhere
                        to <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, we can consider how this adherence
                        should be related to non-proliferation. Tentatively, we are inclined to
                        believe the best approach would be the issuance of appropriate
                        non-acquisition/non-dissemination statements by <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> participants at that time, but this is a matter that we can
                        consider and discuss with other <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        participants between now and then, and not unilaterally decide nor at this
                        time.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">3. Should we take the initiative in promoting support of

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposes that we should endeavor to
                        develop “the widest possible political consensus favorable to a
                        non-proliferation agreement” by mounting an initiative on the basis offered
                        by relevant sections of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> (Cairo)
                        resolution on non-proliferation. In our view, there is today already
                        substantial support for a non-proliferation agreement among those countries
                        which have no possibility of acquiring nuclear weapons, and to the extent
                        that world opinion can pose a barrier to the acquisition of nuclear weapons
                        by countries that can obtain them, that obstacle already exists.
                        Accordingly, we doubt that there is much to be gained by a further major
                        initiative, particularly one which would be resented by our Allies (as
                            <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>'s earlier proposal concerning
                        unilateral non-proliferation declarations was found to be unacceptable both
                        to the Germans and Italians).</p>
                    <p>Moreover, we have some difficulty in believing that the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> resolution would prove to be a very sturdy
                        vehicle for this purpose. Notwithstanding <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0153"/>the fact that the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>
                        resolution is based in part on the Irish Resolution (which we
                            supported),<note n="8" xml:id="d46fn8">See <ref target="#d44fn4">footnote 4, Document 44</ref>.</note> the UAR representative at the
                        Geneva Conference has already sought to precipitate debate concerning the
                        relationship of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> to non-proliferation
                        and advocated holding-up the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> pending
                        agreement. Moreover, as <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> recognizes,
                        the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> resolution, taken as a whole,
                        includes some provisions that are either not acceptable to us (an implied
                        ban on transit of nuclear weapons) or at least undesirable (an international
                        conference on non-proliferation). It would, therefore, be undesirable for
                        the US to “encourage other states to associate themselves with the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> resolution.” Finally, we recognize that the
                            <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> resolution was a “holding action” by
                        the African states instead of agreeing on a nuclear-free zone, and any
                        efforts to influence them (such as <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                        suggests) would not only probably be ineffective but very likely also
                        counterproductive.</p>
                    <p>While we do not, therefore, support the present <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal, we recognize that other countries may well take the
                        initiative. <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> members may well press their
                        proposal in the General Assembly; the Soviet Union will almost certainly
                        inject attacks on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> into that forum;
                        and, all in all, non-proliferation is likely to be a hot topic. Therefore,
                        we believe that we should proceed now with an assessment of those tactics
                        which would best protect our interests. In this context, further
                        consideration could be given to the handling of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> resolution and to preparatory steps, in this or other
                        connections, which it might be desirable for us to undertake in advance of
                        the opening of the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. Accordingly, we
                        recommend that IO, together with <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/MF, <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss>, and
                            <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>, be requested to prepare
                        recommendations concerning our tactical approach.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, I am disturbed about the suggested arrangements for adherence to the
                        new draft non-proliferation agreement which envisage a single depository
                        government and state that it would be open for accession to “all
                        governments.” I believe some way must be found to deal with the problem of
                        East German adherence, particularly if we are to have the support of the
                        Federal Republic.</p>

                        1964. The President's message expounded on the importance of international
                        cooperation in controlling the spread and use of nuclear weapons, indicated
                        U.S. previous arms control initiatives and past achievements in arms
                        control, and urged the participating nations to resolve upon reconvening “to

                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> expatiated on
                        existing bilateral and multilateral safeguards, and the possibilities and
                        problems in extending them more widely.<note n="3" xml:id="d48fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>'s brief account of this
                            meeting was as follows: “We discussed the role of the International
                            Atomic Energy Agency in the application of safeguards and inspection in
                            connection with the peaceful nuclear activities of new nuclear
                            countries. I spoke strongly for a significant role for the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and described the problems of getting
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to go along. I said that much
                            progress in this line has been made in the last year or so.” (<persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, Vol. 9, p. 190)</note> In answer to a question, he noted
                        that US policy is consistent in <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0155"/>not
                        permitting reactor sales without safeguards. Attention was given to the
                        problem of discrimination by the application of safeguards over transfers to
                        non-nuclear powers, while nuclear powers are not obliged to apply such
                        safeguards to their own operations. Insofar as the objective is to curb
                        further proliferation, such a distinction is wholly justifiable; on the
                        other hand, the sensibilities of non-nuclear countries are adversely
                        affected by this distinction.</p>
                    <p>The question was raised whether the Soviets would acquiesce in safeguards on
                        Soviet transfers to other countries, particularly to other “socialist”
                        countries. It was agreed that the Soviets might agree to such safeguards
                        over transfers to non-Bloc countries, but would probably not agree to
                        safeguards on transfers to Bloc countries. They have shown themselves averse
                        to any application within the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> itself.
                        In response to a question, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> stated that he did not believe the Soviets would be
                        concerned over technological intelligence with respect to any reactors they
                        have been willing to supply to other countries. The Soviets have acquiesced
                        to the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards program, but have
                        objected to having the cost of inspections be borne by the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The question was raised whether safeguards on transfers of reactors and
                        fissionable materials is adequate to prevent proliferation. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> noted the recent remark
                        by Dr. Kistiakowsky to the effect that a total test ban is necessary for
                        this purpose. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>
                        agreed, but noted the value of also extending safeguards on transfers.</p>
                    <p>It was observed that the US has been able to persuade countries such as
                        Israel and India, particularly in the latter case only with considerable
                        pressure, to accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on our
                        transferred materials and reactors. India will not, however, accept
                        safeguards on its own planned reactor. Our Ambassador in Tel Aviv has
                        reported that Israel is ready to accept any controls acceptable to the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, so long as there is adequate
                        inspection. It was remarked that the Swedes appear to have a misconception
                        on the intrusiveness of safeguards inspection.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> noted that the
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> did not appear to be the
                        appropriate body for inspection of nuclear free zones. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> agreed that at least for the
                        present the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> was not suitable. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Scoville</persName> noted that the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> could inspect reactors in such zones, and
                        this was generally agreed. The discussion drew attention to the problems
                        posed for the US in seeking effective inspection for such zones, assuming
                        there were no restrictions on transit, while opposing any inspection
                        involving transit.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal for including provisions
                        for <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards in the draft
                        non-proliferation agreement was discussed.<note n="4" xml:id="d48fn4">See
                            Annex A, <ref target="#d44">Document 44</ref>.</note> The <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0156"/>would include provisions both for applying safeguards on
                        transfers, and on the indigenous programs on non-nuclear states. While the
                        discussion was not conclusive, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> noted that this question might be an appropriate
                        one for determination by the Principals.</p>
                    <p>In discussion of the problems posed by the separate Euratom safeguard
                        arrangements, it was noted that many consider such arrangements as at best
                        Western self inspection. Moreover, its safeguards apply only to transactions
                        of the member governments conducted under the specific auspices of Euratom.
                        The Soviets have denounced Euratom and prevented its recognition by the
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The discussion concluded with two recommendations on which there appeared to
                        be a tentative consensus, apart from the divided judgment on the
                        advisability of including provisions for <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> or similar safeguards in a non-proliferation agreement. The
                        first recommendation was to consult with and urge the Western Suppliers
                        Group to adopt a policy requiring <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards on equipment transfers. The desirability of admitting Germany to
                        the Group was also generally agreed upon. It was noted that the French have
                        been offering reactor sales without safeguards, and do not consider
                        themselves bound by decisions of the Suppliers Group. The second
                        recommendation was to encourage Japan to submit its entire nuclear program
                        to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.</p>

                    <p>On October 16, 1964, the People's Republic of China exploded an atomic bomb
                        in the atmosphere. Documentation on this development, which brought the
                        number of nations having atomic weapons to five, is scheduled for
                        publication in volume XXVII. One effect of the successful Chinese test was
                        to heighten concerns throughout the Johnson administration about nuclear
                        proliferation. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s
                        own concern was expressed in a telephone conversation between <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> and Under Secretary of State

                        a.m.: </p>
                    <p>“Bundy said there was lots of feeling by the President that we should get a
                        higher-level, harder look at the problem of nuclear spread—a better policy
                        than we would be able to get by using our interhouse machinery. The thought
                        has been expressed [that] a nuclear spread task force be established. He
                        mentioned Ros <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> in this
                        regard, whom <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0157"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought would be excellent. It
                        was decided that Bundy would tentatively mention this to the President,
                        subject to what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> would
                        have to say on it.” (Johnson Library, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> Papers, Disarmament, Box 3)</p>
                    <p>On November 1, the White House announced the appointment of a special panel
                        of citizens to advise the President on the proliferation problem. In this
                        announcement the panel was asked “to explore the widest range of measures
                        that the United States might undertake in conjunction with other governments
                        or by itself.” (Quoted in <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Glenn T.

                            for U.N. member states that were in arrears in the payment of their
                            financial obligations.</note> it might be a long time before
                        non-proliferation would come up at the General Assembly. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> stated that the paper on “tactics”
                        on non-proliferation for the General Assembly had been prepared by the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> Committee at this

                            “Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,” which was sent under cover of a
                            memorandum from Foster to the Committee of Principals, November 12.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> explained in his
                            memorandum that the paper set forth a general course of action on the
                            proliferation problem for the United States at the forthcoming U.N.
                            General Assembly: “While, as the paper notes, it will be necessary to
                            retain tactical flexibility in order to take account of the results of
                            consultations and the developing situation with respect to the General
                            Assembly, it seems appropriate for the Principals to consider and
                            approve the general tactical line.” (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_RD2">RD</gloss> Files:

                        formal discussion at the General Assembly. Three questions which involve
                        important policy matters were highlighted in the covering memorandum.<note n="5" xml:id="d50fn5">The three points were: 1) Should the United States
                            try to include a non-acquisition pledge into the resolution; 2) Should
                            such a resolution include a provision calling upon non-member states of
                            the United Nations to declare their readiness to undertake the same
                            obligations; and 3) The danger of an amendment to the resolution seeking

                        stressed the need for secrecy on the proposal for the Irish to present the
                        resolution at the General Assembly<note n="6" xml:id="d50fn6">At the
                            prompting of the United States, the Republic of Ireland during the
                            summer of 1964 quietly began to circulate a draft resolution on
                            non-proliferation to a number of delegations in the U.N. General
                            Assembly. (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>

                        he emphasized that the resolution was illustrative since changes might of
                        necessity occur during the process of presentation.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked the basic question
                        of whether the US should oppose other countries' obtaining nuclear weapons
                        over the next ten years. Should it always be the US which would have to use
                        nuclear weapons against Red China? He could conceive of situations where the
                        Japanese or Indians might desirably have their own nuclear weapons.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that this
                        question had not been staffed thoroughly in the Department of Defense, but
                        he thought it unlikely that the Indians or Japanese would ever have a
                        suitable nuclear deterrent. He thought a group should be established to
                        study this basic policy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> stated he had asked a committee to investigate inter-Asian
                        security problems, giving consideration to a US-supplied Far Eastern nuclear
                        stockpile. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> agreed that
                        these alternatives should be looked at but that in the meantime it was
                        necessary to maintain a strong non-proliferation policy. Once a nation had
                        taken the nuclear road, it would be impossible to turn back. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> concurred that the
                        resolution should be available, if needed, but that the Gilpatric Committee
                        and a US Government group should study the desirability of
                        non-proliferation. He raised the question of whether a non-proliferation
                        policy automatically meant providing a nuclear guarantee to all countries
                        for, if so, this would be a major policy change.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> pointed out that when the
                        General Assembly convenes we will be under major pressure in this area since
                        a number of other countries would be pushing actions which would be less
                        acceptable to the US. He did not believe that the proposed course of action
                        would preclude a different non-proliferation policy which might develop from
                        the studies proposed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        emphasized that the present discussions should continue with a clear
                        understanding that US policy favored non-proliferation. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> stated that he saw no other pattern
                        than non-proliferation since anything else would involve a loss of US
                        control.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> discussed the bracketed
                        points in the draft resolution.<note n="7" xml:id="d50fn7">The bracketed
                            parts are contained in three paragraphs of illustrative <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> Non-Proliferation Resolution, October

                                not intend to manufacture or otherwise acquire control of nuclear
                                weapons, and] that they are ready to undertake, through an
                                international agreement to be concluded under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> auspices, not to manufacture or otherwise acquire

                        </note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> believed
                        that the Germans should be consulted <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0160"/>since Par. 3 puts them under considerable pressure. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that the British Prime Minister
                        had today made a strong statement against the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. He raised the problem of concealing a treaty obligation
                        (bracketed Section in Par. 2) in a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        resolution since a resolution had no mandatory authority. Perhaps Par. 2.c.
                        might ask States to inform the Secretary General of their intention not to
                        acquire nuclear weapons. He also questioned the desirability of inserting
                        “national” before “control” in this paragraph. Without this the Canadians
                        might claim they were forced to give up their participation with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear forces. He felt it most unlikely
                        that the Germans would be willing to undertake the obligations in bracketed
                        Par. 3.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> emphasized that the
                        bracketed Par. 2 was the most constructive action in the resolution and
                        would have major value during the interim required for negotiating the
                        treaty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> pointed out that
                        this was the only major addition to the Irish resolution and also stressed
                        that we had always construed the use of control as in the Irish resolution
                        to refer to “national.” The insertion of “national” at this point would
                        weaken this interpretation for other documents in which it was not present.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> pointed out that the
                        most critical problem in the General Assembly would be the introduction of
                        an anti-<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> clause into any
                        non-proliferation actions.</p>
                    <p>The Canadians felt that some such self-denying ordinance as a proposed
                        resolution was necessary on the part of those states having nuclear
                        capability who had not chosen to develop weapons. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> indicated that the Swedes were
                        reluctant to have to vote again at this time on the proliferation issue.</p>
                    <p>In view of this discussion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> questioned whether the procedural resolution would not be
                        better than the proposed non-proliferation one.<note n="8" xml:id="d50fn8">Reference is to Draft Procedural Resolution, October 30, attached as
                            Tab 2 to the November 9 paper.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> believed that pushing the procedural resolution first
                        would look like a stalling action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said the matter was one of tactics of deciding to push
                        for a resolution with which we could live with or getting a lot of
                        resolutions which were unacceptable and then might be handled by the
                        procedural resolution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName>
                        indicated that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Staff felt we needed
                        something more than the Irish resolution; perhaps some intermediate
                        resolution would be satisfactory. Certainly, we would have to do something
                        more than to agree to go to a meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> pointed out that there have been several
                        international meetings on the subject, such as the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> and non-alignment conferences. The other nations wish to
                        get on with the problem of non-proliferation and also to limit the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The US resolution tends to get the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> out of the picture and satisfy their
                        desires to get on with non-proliferation. <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0161"/>The US would have a difficult time, at best, and therefore
                        we needed a positive policy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> stated that it was
                        disconcerting to see gaps in the concern about disarmament in many
                        countries. There was no evidence that many countries were worried about
                        non-proliferation. Most countries ignore disarmament for themselves and
                        support sweeping resolutions on disarmament for the world. He felt there
                        should be limitations on conventional weapons transfer as well as nuclear.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> pointed out that the
                        purpose of this exercise was to go beyond idle statements and reach some
                        kind of semi-binding international agreement similar to the “ban the bombs
                        in orbit” resolution.<note n="9" xml:id="d50fn9">See <ref target="#d15fn3">footnote 3, Document 15</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> felt that the non-proliferation
                        proposal had broader support than other possible items, the inclusion of
                        which might only serve to muddy the waters and preclude achieving a
                        meaningful resolution on non-proliferation.</p>
                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> stressed the
                        importance of the enforcement side and discussed the progress being made in
                        instituting <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards. This program
                        was moving in parallel to the one under discussion and he saw no
                        inconsistency with the resolution except for the possibility that the
                        resolution might justify some nations in rejecting the need for safeguards.
                        He urged that we continue to press other countries to place reactors under
                        safeguards and for suppliers, such as the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        and Canada, to demand safeguards in connection with their international
                        programs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> pointed out that
                            <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> had circulated another paper
                        relative to programs in this area which had been generally approved by the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> Committee.<note n="10" xml:id="d50fn10">Reference may be to the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> paper on safeguards discussed at the September 25 meeting
                            of the Committee on Nuclear Weapons Capabilities. See <ref target="#d48">Document 48</ref>.</note>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> questioned whether the
                        proposed resolution could be strengthened by inclusion of a requirement for
                        safeguards in the international agreement.</p>
                    <p>Following this discussion, the following actions were decided upon:</p>
                    <p>a. Par. 2 of the draft resolution should be amended for further consideration
                        to include a reference to a requirement for safeguards in any international
                        agreements to be concluded.</p>
                    <p>b. Par. 3 should be changed to substitute “governments and authorities” for
                        “states.”</p>
                    <p>In concluding the meeting, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> again urged that the question of alternatives to our
                        non-proliferation policy should be kept highly classified. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and others agreed that there
                        should be no question that the established Government policy is against
                        proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>

                    <p>The President has appointed a special Task Force on Nuclear Proliferation,

                        Gilpatric</persName>, to study means to prevent the spread of nuclear
                        weapons. The Task Force has been asked to examine the problem in its
                        broadest ramifications. It is expected that the Task Force report will be
                        available for the President by the end of January 1965.</p>
                    <p>In addition to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>, the

                    </p>
                    <p>As a generalization, while I think we are all agreed that it would be useful
                        if we could find some significant step to take with the Soviets in the field
                        of disarmament, I suggest we should be on our guard not to fall into
                        becoming victims of a standard Soviet tactic; that is, that we put forward
                        sound proposals which they reject and, after a time, we abandon them and
                        scratch around to find something else upon which we can agree. This often
                        results in a serious weakening of our position. My point is that we should
                        continue to plug sound proposals even though they are categorically rejected
                        by the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>On the question of non-proliferation, I do not think we should put forward,
                        at this time, an assurance that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        would not be used to increase the number of independent decision-making
                        entities controlling <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0164"/>the use of
                        nuclear weapons. I do not think that such an assurance would change the
                        attitude of the Soviets at this time and it would block any possibility of
                        an Asiatic <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> before such an institution
                        has been seriously examined. Even if it were decided to give such an
                        assurance, I should think this would be one of the last concessions we would
                        make in a negotiation.</p>
                    <p>A comprehensive test ban treaty would probably eliminate any possibility of
                        developing Plowshare. I wonder whether we should reopen the question of a
                        comprehensive ban just at this time when the Soviets have shown some
                        interest in Plowshare programs. I would agree, however, that a priority
                        review of the present US position would be useful.</p>
                    <p>Of all the proposals in the memorandum, the suggestion for a tacit agreement
                        to halt new construction of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites
                        without on-the-ground inspection seems to me the most likely to have some
                        chance of Soviet acceptance. There would appear to be three troublesome
                        problems with it however. One would be that it would probably have the
                        result of pushing the Soviets to put their resources into sea-borne
                        launchers which are more difficult for us to deal with. A second problem is
                        that if <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s and IRBMs are excluded, the
                        proposal may look to our European allies as an attempt to deal with our
                        problem without worrying about theirs. A third problem is, as you point out,
                        the question as to whether <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s should be
                        included or not. The Soviets may look at this proposal simply as a means of
                        our attempting to freeze a US advantage, but it might appeal to them on the
                        basis that it could reduce their costs at a critical time. In any event,
                        before putting forward such a proposal, I should think there would have to
                        be careful examination of the effectiveness of our national capability of
                        detecting secret deployments by the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the cutback and eventual cut-off in fissionable material
                        production, it is my understanding that if we should go in for multiple
                        warheads in a big way, this would materially increase the need for
                        plutonium. I should think that this question should at least be looked at
                        before any decision is made.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> raised the subject of
                        non-dissemination, noting the Secretary knew well the Soviet position on
                        that subject. That position had been stated on a number of occasions, but,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said, he wished to state
                        again that the Soviet Government attached great importance to the
                        non-dissemination question. The U.S., too, had on a number of occasions
                        stressed the significance of that question. In the past, the Soviet Union
                        had the impression of the U.S. sincerely wanting a non-dissemination
                        agreement. However, as time went on, it had become clear that this was not
                        so because, in parallel with U.S. statements stressing the importance of
                        non-dissemination and indicating the desire for negotiations and agreement
                        on that subject, plans were being hatched for the creation of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>—in other words, plans for associating the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> with nuclear weapons. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that on behalf of the Soviet
                        Government, he wished to state once again that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> plans were an obstacle to agreement on non-dissemination.
                        The Soviet Union was of the opinion that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would be of no significance from the military standpoint, given
                        the existing correlation of forces. But the situation in Europe and the
                        world at <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0166"/>large would become much
                        more dangerous and alarming if the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> were
                        created. The Soviet Union could not ignore the fact that Germany had
                        unleashed two world wars within the span of one generation. He said he
                        wanted to repeat with all forcefulness that a non-dissemination agreement
                        was obstructed by the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> plans. If that
                        obstacle were removed, a broad non-dissemination agreement could be
                        concluded which would be in the interests of both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.,
                        and of the world at large. As to the content of such an agreement, the
                        Soviet Union had given the U.S. a proposed text.<note n="2" xml:id="d53fn2">Not further identified.</note> The Soviet Union regarded that text as
                        not being out of date, but was prepared to discuss language at any time. He
                        hoped that the U.S. Government would be prepared again to discuss the
                        non-dissemination problem with the Soviet Government and any other party
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> went on to say that the
                        Soviet Union was not impressed by tranquillizing statements regarding some
                        separate arrangements between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> which allegedly removed the threat to the Soviet Union. Such
                        statements were not tranquillizing at all and could not be accepted.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we regarded non-dissemination as a very serious problem to
                        all of us at this time. We believed that today at least half a dozen
                        countries had the technical capability of detonating a nuclear device within
                        two or three years, with the expenditure of about $150 million above what
                        was being spent today on peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Another half a
                        dozen countries could do the same, but somewhat later. We regarded the
                        spread of nuclear weapons as a very negative and dangerous development. It
                        was in the very nature of nuclear weapons that those who had them and knew
                        about them viewed their spread with dismay. Therefore, the U.S. had been
                        consistently against dissemination.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then said he wished to ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> a couple of questions. He noted that most of what we
                        were doing was known to the U.S.S.R. from our public statements or
                        announcements, whereas the reverse was not true. We had certain information
                        indicating that the Soviet Union had made arrangements with some countries
                        on its side regarding nuclear delivery vehicles, and we were wondering about
                        any arrangements the U.S.S.R. might have with those countries regarding
                        actual nuclear weapons, their control, etc. The Secretary pointed out that
                        while we were virgins with respect to dissemination, we were not certain
                        about the U.S.S.R. The only cooperation in the nuclear weapons field we had
                        was with the U.K., and such cooperation stemmed from our partnership in the
                        nuclear weapons program during World War II. On the other hand, some of our
                        visitors to Moscow, in talking with Soviet personalities, <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0167"/>had received the impression that the Soviet
                        Union had provided fuel for the Chinese detonation. He therefore thought it
                        useful to ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> about
                        Soviet arrangements with other parties regarding delivery vehicles and also
                        about any Soviet contribution to the Chinese capability of detonating a
                        nuclear device.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> responded that as far as
                        China was concerned, he had already given the Secretary certain
                        clarifications, and there was nothing he could add. In any event, the U.S.
                        should base its conclusions regarding Soviet actions on Soviet statements
                        rather than on rumors stemming from dubious sources. Regarding allegations
                        about delivery vehicle arrangements, which were also based on rumors, he
                        could only say that in considering the non-dissemination problem, the U.S.
                        should not look for any difference between Soviet words and deed. There were
                        perhaps other governments whose words and deeds differed and whose policies
                        of yesterday were not those of today, or whose policies of today might
                        change tomorrow. He wished to stress that it was in the interest of peace to
                        have a broad non-dissemination agreement concluded. Otherwise, if nuclear
                        weapons were to spread all over the world, everybody would lose. Perhaps the
                        U.S. Government would find it possible to consider this problem with a view
                        to finding agreement between the two sides. He wished to note that
                        discussions on non-dissemination, just as talks on any important subject,
                        were no hide-and-seek game. The great powers particularly should keep this
                        in mind, since no responsible government was free to say one thing and do
                        another. Therefore, he wanted to appeal to the U.S. Government to approach
                        non-dissemination in a serious manner; perhaps not everything was lost yet
                        and perhaps there was still possibility of agreement. If no agreement should
                        be reached, many non-nuclear powers would acquire nuclear weapons, the
                        situation would be much more complicated and much more difficult to control,
                        and all parties would stand to lose.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he didn't wish to press the questions he had asked of Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. However, he wished to
                        point out some facts as we saw them. For instance, some Warsaw Pact
                        countries had publicly displayed armaments highly inefficient for use as
                        conventional weapons but highly suitable for use as nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> interjected that this
                        might be a subjective appraisal. The Secretary responded that he couldn't
                        help being who he was or being on his side.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary continued that whenever <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        countries were in a similar position there were public statements giving the
                        necessary information, but there was no such information in the case of the
                        Warsaw Pact countries. The Secretary stressed that we were deeply concerned
                        about proliferation. The danger of proliferation came from different
                        sources. For example, Sweden and Switzerland, two countries with a <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0168"/>long and profound tradition of
                        neutrality, in signing the Limited Test Ban had stated that they were not
                        giving up their right to any future decision regarding acquisition of a
                        nuclear weapons capability. The French Prime Minister recently had made a
                        speech in which he said that if a nation had the capability of producing
                        nuclear weapons it was almost obligated to do so.<note n="3" xml:id="d53fn3">Presumably a reference to French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou's
                            speech in the French National Assembly on December 2. Text in <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1964</hi>, pp.
                        492-497.</note> As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> knew,
                        we were in disagreement with France on this point. The Chinese detonation
                        had raised questions in India and Japan. While we hoped that those countries
                        would not embark upon a nuclear weapons program, this situation still
                        presented a grave problem. Moreover, unfortunately, the question of
                        acquiring nuclear weapons also arose among those countries who were the
                        targets of nuclear weapons. It was one thing to have nuclear weapons and
                        another to be in the bull's-eye of those weapons. He did not wish to
                        recriminate, but the fact was that some <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries were in the target area of nuclear weapons. For this
                        reason, those countries wanted a voice in nuclear defense matters, matters
                        which were vital to their security.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, the Secretary noted that
                        he had discussed this subject with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on earlier occasions. What he wished to know was
                        whether the Soviet Union objected to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        really on strictly non-dissemination grounds or whether its objections were
                        due to some broader considerations. If the latter was the case, e.g., if the
                        Soviet Union was objecting to the existence of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as such, there was nothing that could be done about it,
                        although of course we hoped that gradually the situation would improve and
                        tensions would lessen. On the other hand, if the Soviet objections to the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> were based on non-dissemination, he
                        wished to repeat that under the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        arrangements, we would not permit transfer of nuclear weapons or of nuclear
                        weapons technology to any non-nuclear member of the force. Of course, a
                        great deal of information about nuclear technology was now available in
                        popular publications which even high school students could read, but he
                        wished to stress that under the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        arrangements, no non-nuclear member would be involved in the overhaul or
                        repair of nuclear weapons or would obtain custody of such weapons. In sum,
                        no non-nuclear member of the force would be able to acquire national nuclear
                        weapons capability through the force, no such member could employ the
                        weapons on its own, and no such member could take apart or repair nuclear
                        weapons. Consequently, we saw no arrangement envisaged for the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> that would be inconsistent with the
                        principle of non-dissemination. Our conscience was clear as regards
                        non-dissemination in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. If the Soviet
                        Union was concerned that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> might be
                        only the first <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0169"/>step towards
                        acquisition of national nuclear weapons capability, such concern could be
                        removed, and we could state that the first step would be the last step.
                        Indeed, this point was reflected in the non-proliferation language we had
                        given the Soviet Union two years ago. While he didn't know about the
                        situation among the socialist states, the Secretary said that the problem of
                        dissemination did exist in non-socialist states, whether they were allied
                        with us or not. The Chinese detonation was a great disappointment to us and
                        we did not believe it was a good thing for us or the Soviet Union or anyone
                        else. But those were the factors urging others to build their own nuclear
                        weapons unless, of course, we succeeded in stopping the process. In the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, we gave participation to those who
                        were the target of nuclear weapons so that they could know they would be
                        taken into account in decisions regarding nuclear defense, but without
                        transfer of nuclear weapons capability. However, with respect to such
                        countries as Sweden, Switzerland, India, and possibly others, we needed
                        Soviet cooperation to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. The Secretary
                        observed that he had discussed all this on a number of occasions and there
                        was nothing he could add at this point. The <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was still under discussion, and as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> knew, the British Prime Minister
                        was coming to Washington next week.<note n="4" xml:id="d53fn4">Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Harold Wilson</persName> had
                            discussions with U.S. leaders in Washington, December 6-9. For selected

                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would surely learn a
                        great deal about those discussions from newspapers. But, in any event, if
                        the Soviet concern about the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was with
                        respect to non-dissemination, we could meet it because we ourselves are
                        against proliferation. On the other hand, if the Soviet Union was against
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, we were afraid we could not do
                        much about it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said Soviet objections to
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> were based on both broad and narrow
                        considerations. The broad consideration was that German imperialists had
                        unleashed two world wars in thirty years. The Soviet Union had suffered
                        tremendous losses in those wars, and particularly in World War II. It was
                        good that the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. had been on the same side in World War
                        II, but still it was the Soviet Union which had had to bear the main burden
                        in fighting the Germans. The Soviet Union could not ignore this fact in
                        appraising the situation in Europe and in looking into the future. This is
                        how he wanted to answer the Secretary's first question. In reply to the
                        Secretary's second question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said, he wished to state that the Soviet Union could not
                        rely on U.S. assurances regarding the various technical safeguards such as
                        keys, etc., because all such technical devices were subordinate to policy.
                        The policy of German military quarters was well known to the Soviet Union;
                        the ashes of World War II had been still warm when the German militarists
                        advanced the slogan calling for a revision of the German borders established
                            <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0170"/>as a result of World War II.
                        Consequently, the U.S.S.R. could not rely on those technical devices the
                        U.S. maintained would prevent proliferation. In asking his second question,
                        the Secretary had mentioned <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The
                        Secretary knew the Soviet appraisal of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, which was that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> did not
                        serve peace. However, if we started discussing this question, that would
                        lead us far away and there was really no point in doing so.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then stated that if the
                        U.S. had definitely decided to create the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, it was assuming a great and heavy responsibility. The Soviet
                        Government would regard the creation of an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, in whatever form, and the provision of access to nuclear
                        weapons to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> as a hostile act towards
                        the Soviet Union. If the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> plans were
                        implemented, the Soviet Government and its allies obviously would have to
                        draw appropriate conclusions for their own policy. However, he still hoped
                        that not everything was lost and that a broad and conclusive agreement on
                        non-dissemination could be reached.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he wished to comment briefly on a few of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s points. He said he disagreed with
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s remarks about German
                        militarists. We knew the background of the two World Wars, in both of which
                        our two countries had been on the same side. It was for this reason that we
                        wanted a definitive settlement of the German problem in a period when we
                        knew that the Germans wanted peace, when the Germans were deeply involved
                        with the rest of Europe, and when it was possible to prevent a development
                        echoing the past. As to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, it was not
                        up to Washington alone to make a decision. This question would be decided by
                        a number of governments as a group and not unilaterally by the U.S. However,
                        in any event, we were not talking about access to nuclear weapons and this
                        was a fundamental point. No one—Germany, Italy, or anyone else—in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would have access to nuclear weapons in the
                        sense anybody could object to. No national nuclear weapons capability and no
                        technical nuclear capability would arise from the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. There would be further discussions on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> among the allies, and the Soviet Union
                        would surely be au courant as they proceeded. We hoped the Soviet Union
                        would cooperate so that we could have general agreement on
                        non-dissemination. However, the Secretary said, he wished to emphasize that
                        he was talking about actual nuclear weapons and not about considerations
                        having nothing to do with actual weapons.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> noted the advanced hour
                        and said that at the next meeting with the Secretary, he would wish to
                        discuss the question of the reduction of troops in Europe. He would wish to
                        ascertain the U.S. views on whether anything could be agreed upon in that
                        area. In addition, he would wish to discuss the question of a German peace
                        settlement and to <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0171"/>see whether there
                        was any possibility of agreement on certain aspects of the German problem.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he had no objection to discussing these points. For his
                        part, he would also want to get Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s views about the prospects for agreement on the
                        so-called bonfire. He wondered whether we could add certain armaments to
                        those included in our original bonfire proposal. In addition, perhaps
                        certain points from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s
                        speech at the General Assembly could be discussed at the next meeting, since
                        we assumed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would
                        speak before he met again with us.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the next meeting would take place on December 9, prior to
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s meeting with the
                        President.</p>

                    <p>[Here follow exchanges of pleasantries, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s general survey of U.S.-Soviet relations, and the
                        President's optimistic assessment of the relationship over the past year.]</p>
                    <p>The President continued that in the period of the Democratic administrations,
                        we had been encouraged by the progress made in some fields. Agreement had
                        been reached on the hot line, on the Limited Test Ban, <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0172"/>and the Consular Convention now pending
                        before the Senate. Also, there had been reciprocal actions by the U.S. and
                        the U.S.S.R. in cutting back the production of fissionable materials for
                        weapons purposes, and substantial reductions had been made in our
                        preparedness effort. We had observed with pleasure the desire of the Soviet
                        Government to reduce its military budget. As far as we were concerned, in
                        the brief period between 1964 and 1966, there would be a reduction in our
                        military spending by some $2-3 billion; this was a substantial reduction,
                        particularly if one took into account the military pay-raise, which
                        obviously would not add to our military effort but would only make it easier
                        for military personnel to acquire goods for their own use, such as housing,
                        etc. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s plan provided
                        for the closing of 566 military installations; just recently, he had
                        announced the closing of 95 such installations. This trend towards economy
                        caused hardships in certain areas, but generally speaking the American
                        people were pleased with it.</p>
                    <p>The President then noted that he had tried, notwithstanding occasional
                        failure, to understand some things he saw in the papers. He had tried to
                        refrain from criticizing Soviet leaders personally, even though sometimes he
                        read in the papers about their views on what he did in certain parts of the
                        world. He simply took the papers home, showed them to his wife, and tried to
                        forget, without replying. He did so because he sincerely believed that both
                        of our countries wanted peace if they could only find it. They were like
                        children hunting for Easter eggs, and it was important that both of them
                        searched until they were found. Things would be all right if both of our
                        countries showed patience and understanding and if they adhered to the
                        principle of “do unto others as you would have them do unto you.”</p>
                    <p>Summarizing, the President said we wanted to do everything in order to
                        improve U.S.-Soviet relations. He reiterated his pleasure at the hot line
                        agreement, and said he was also pleased with the Exchange Program and the
                        understandings reached in the field of outer space. He noted that he had
                        received an excellent report from his Science Advisor, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName>, who had been very well received in
                        the Soviet Union and who had greatly enjoyed his discussions there.<note n="2" xml:id="d54fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> headed a delegation of
                            U.S. industrial research leaders that visited factories, laboratories,
                            and engineering design institutes from Moscow to Novosibirsk in Siberia
                            during a 2-week study tour in mid-November. No written report of
                                <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName>'s trip has been
                        found.</note> He had also received a good report from the U.S. businessmen
                        who recently had visited the Soviet Union.<note n="3" xml:id="d54fn3">Reference may be to the business leaders who accompanied <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName>. No written report of their
                            visit has been found.</note> Reiterating that the Consular Convention
                        was pending in the Senate, the President also noted that the U.S.-Soviet Air
                        Agreement was ready for signature; however, we didn't want to kill the
                        former by signing the latter prematurely. The President reiterated that the
                        November <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0173"/>elections clearly showed
                        that the American people rejected the course advocated by Goldwater, a
                        course which was opposed to the one the present Administration was
                        following. Some people had said rather ugly things about Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in connection with his economy
                        drive. But we believed that the American people at large supported the
                        policies of the present Administration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thanked the President for
                        his views and said he would convey them to the Soviet Government. He thought
                        there were two main questions relating to U.S.-Soviet relations. The first
                        one was that of the arms race. Arms were constantly piling up; indeed,
                        stockpiles were as high as the Mont Blanc. However, what was important was
                        not only their quantity but also their destructive capability. The Soviet
                        Government believed it would be important if both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.,
                        as well as other countries, were to find a radical solution to the armaments
                        problem. In such a case, all would gain—both the U.S. and U.S.S.R., and also
                        the U.K., France, and others. Of course, this was a very complex problem and
                        even if there was a will to resolve it, its solution would require time.
                        Therefore, partial steps were needed. He did not wish to enumerate the
                        individual steps which the Soviet Union believed would lessen tensions and
                        facilitate disarmament, inasmuch as he had discussed them with the
                        Secretary. However, he did want to draw the President's attention to one
                        area where the Soviet Union believed there was possibility of agreement. The
                        Soviet Union believed that it should be possible to reduce U.S. and Soviet
                        troops, as well as foreign troops generally, in Europe. Such a step would
                        not be important from the standpoint of the existing correlation of forces
                        since such correlation would remain unchanged; however, such a step would
                        reduce tensions in Europe and in the world at large. Referring to the
                        President's remark about the closing of 95 bases, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he wished to point out that
                        one could close 95 obsolete bases and build two new ones which would be more
                        powerful than all the 95 taken together. He thought this point only
                        emphasized the importance of disarmament.</p>
                    <p>As to the President's remark about some statements aimed at him personally,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said they were probably
                        an incorrect interpretation by the American press. There had been no
                        statements by Soviet leaders aimed at personalities; they spoke only in
                        terms of the principles of policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said he wished to turn to the European problem, and
                        particularly the German question. However, perhaps the President might first
                        wish to comment on the arms race problem.</p>

                    <p>The President noted that both sides had had a great number of discussions
                        about disarmament and had submitted their respective proposals at various
                        times. He said only today he had suggested to the Secretary that the Soviet

                        contained any hope of agreement. Earlier this year, the President continued,
                        he had made a statement expounding the views of our Government on the
                        subject of disarmament. He hoped progress could be made in this area. We
                        were particularly concerned about the problem of non-proliferation. He had
                        spent the past two or three days discussing this very problem; namely, how
                        to keep nuclear weapons from getting into the hands of others.<note n="5" xml:id="d54fn5">An apparent reference to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s talks with British Prime

                        to the bases we were closing, they were not essential to the state of
                        preparedness we believed was required, and we would save the salaries of
                        50,000-60,000 men who would be released as a result of that action. The
                        President reiterated his pleasure at our intended reduction in military
                        spending by $2-3 billion between 1964 and 1966, and at the Soviet-announced
                        cut of 500 million rubles in their upcoming military budget. He said the
                        U.S. would be willing to consider any suggestions regarding disarmament and
                        repeated that we would evaluate the Soviet December 7 disarmament statement
                        with a view to fully exploring the possibilities for agreement, if there
                        were any.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the remarks made about him personally, he did not mean that there
                        had been comments about his height or looks, but he did wish to stress the
                        desirability of not questioning the motives of other governments and of
                        knowing what one was talking about. We had always refrained from questioning
                        the motives of the other side and we believed this was better for our
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>The President then stressed the concern we had about the nuclear explosion
                        conducted by the Chinese Communists. He said we were anxious to avoid a
                        situation where others might follow in the footsteps of the Chinese. We were
                        doing all we could to discourage others from embarking upon a nuclear
                        weapons program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that since the
                        President had stated the U.S. Government's support for disarmament and
                        non-proliferation, he wished to state that it was the Soviet Government's
                        firm position to do everything to facilitate disarmament and to prevent
                        proliferation.</p>
                    <p>Turning to Europe, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said
                        World War II had left behind it a very complex situation. The Soviet Union
                        did not regret the results of <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0175"/>the
                        War. Both of our countries had been on the same side of the barricades in
                        World War II, and it was as a result of their joint struggle that Nazi
                        Germany had been forced to its knees. However, now the situation was
                        different. In the light of past experience, the Soviet Union wanted to
                        create a situation in Europe where no seeds of a new world war could be
                        sown. Thus, the Soviet Union believed it to be most important for the U.S.,
                        the U.S.S.R., and the other states concerned to draw a line under World War
                        II and to have a German peace settlement on the basis of the situation which
                        exists as a result of that war. That would be in the interest of both of our
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the second point
                        he wished to make was related to non-dissemination and to the general
                        situation in Europe as well. The Soviet Union saw a great danger in the
                        plans for providing the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> with access to
                        nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union was not concerned over this because the
                        existing correlation of forces would change. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would not become stronger as a result of the implementation of
                        those plans, but the possibilities for provocation by the Germans would
                        greatly increase and the situation in Europe would become much more acute.
                        He continued that the Soviet Union would welcome it if common language could
                        be found on a German peace settlement and on the question of
                        non-proliferation. He wondered whether the President could state his views
                        on these points, noting that he had another brief point to raise later.</p>
                    <p>The President reiterated that we were greatly concerned about the fact that
                        the Chinese had developed and exploded their nuclear device, and that we
                        wanted to do everything possible to prevent any other power from following
                        the Chinese example. We realized that the more nations possessed nuclear
                        weapons, the greater the danger, and we would not do anything which would
                        increase that capacity. The U.K. now wished to minimize its effort in the
                        nuclear weapons field, and we did not want to stimulate the Germans to
                        exercise the capacity we knew they could possess. The President said he had
                        tried to be very patient during his service as President, and we now had the
                        U.K. discussing the problem with the Germans rather than Uncle Sam having to
                        indicate any particular conduct. Of course, there were some who wanted to
                        encourage the Germans to build up their own capacity. We were trying to
                        counter this because we saw what happened in China. Thus, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> could be sure that we were genuine
                        and sincere in our attempts to keep nuclear weapons from spreading. We
                        recognized the tremendous power the Soviet Union had, and we also recognized
                        our own tremendous power. We were not anxious at all to see the number of
                        nuclear powers increase. He assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that we did not want to encourage the proliferation
                        process. The President said he was happy that both sides now seemed to be in
                        agreement as to the importance of non-proliferation, <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0176"/>and his people would be encouraged by what
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said on this point.
                        As to Germany, we would be glad to receive any new ideas the Soviet Union
                        might have on the German problem. Of course, we were familiar with the
                        standing Soviet position that both German states should be recognized. The
                        President said he did not believe much progress could be made on that basis.
                        If the Soviet Union had any new ideas, he would ask the Secretary to stop
                        traveling all over the world and get busy studying them.</p>
                    <p>Reverting to non-proliferation, the President said we did not have in mind to
                        give the Germans nuclear technology or to encourage nuclear aspirations in
                        any other way. What we were trying to do was to deter them from seeking an
                        independent capability and to forestall any pressures that might develop in
                        that direction. The U.K. was now prepared to give up its independent
                        capability and to get out of the picture; what we wanted to do was to
                        prevent the Germans from getting into the picture. In this effort, we needed
                        Soviet encouragement and maybe even their prayers. For, as frequently is the
                        case in negotiations, we were not in complete agreement with our partners in
                        the course of the past two days' discussions. The pressure for an
                        independent nuclear capability in Germany was not strong today, but it could
                        become so quickly in the absence of our leadership.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> commented that while it
                        was true that both sides said they were in favor of non-proliferation, they
                        were in agreement only in theory and their actions were in different
                        directions. The President has said the Germans might follow the Chinese
                        example; however, the Soviet Union was providing an alternative, namely, a
                        broad non-proliferation agreement. As to new ideas on the German problem,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that if the exchange
                        of views on the German problem continued, he did not exclude the possibility
                        of the Soviet Union's put-ting forward new considerations on some points,
                        particularly on the question of the Western forces in West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that he would have discussions with his colleagues
                        shortly and that he would be in touch with the Soviet side.</p>

                        certain as to what direction the policy of the new Soviet Government will
                            take.<note n="3" xml:id="d55fn3">On October 15, it was announced in

                        disarmament debate in the United Nations is delayed, as now seems possible,
                        I should think there would be a delay in the resumption of the work of the

                        would suggest we might do well to wait to see how the Sino-Soviet quarrel
                        develops. In any event, I doubt if the new Soviet leadership is yet ready to
                        take any important steps in this field.</p>

                    <p>(a) We are presently embarked on the course of seeking an acceptable
                        Resolution in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> which would
                        hopefully reduce opportunities for Soviet obstructionism. This continues to
                        seem to be the most promising course for progress on non-proliferation
                        during the period of decision on Allied nuclear arrangements.</p>
                    <p>(b) I do not believe that it would be appropriate or feasible for the US to
                        approach the Soviets at this time with respect to assurances on such matters
                        as the European clause of an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. We can, of
                        course, restate our general assurances that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> forces could not be used by national decision of any
                        non-nuclear power. However, we should not go beyond this until the issues
                        involved are decided in negotiations with our Allies.</p>
                    <p>(c) I am still very skeptical of the wisdom of giving assurance that the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> will not be used to increase the
                        number of independent decision-making entities. It would appear to me that
                        this will be worked out in connection with the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> itself and, since I do not believe it would in fact change the
                        Soviet attitude toward <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, I do not think
                        we should give such an assurance at this time, particularly in the absence
                        of any quid pro quo.</p>

                    <p>(d) In addition, I do not believe that any assurance, even one jettisoning
                        the European clause, would buy acceptance by the Soviets pending final
                        resolution of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> question. As you know,
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> shares this

                        Strategic Nuclear Delivery Vehicles</p>
                    <p>(a) In the memorandum of December 3 much of the discussion is written in
                        terms of “nuclear delivery vehicles”; it should specify strategic nuclear
                        delivery vehicles in all cases.<note n="4" xml:id="d55fn4">In the margin
                            next to this sentence is the handwritten notation, presumably by
                                <persName corresp="#p_KSMJ1">Keeny</persName>: “correct!”</note> Any
                        question with respect to tactical nuclear delivery vehicles would pose a
                        host of additional problems with respect to ongoing programs especially, but
                        not exclusively, with respect to our European Allies. Although we would wish
                        to define “strategic” vehicles as we have done in our production freeze
                        proposal, we must recognize that the Soviets will almost certainly continue
                        to challenge that definition.</p>
                    <p>(b) In consideration of any measure of this kind, it would be necessary to
                        assure continuing freedom to transfer strategic delivery vehicles to an
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>(c) At a time when we are still considering the implications of Chinese
                        acquisition of nuclear weapons, we should preserve options for possible
                        transfer of strategic delivery vehicles.</p>
                    <p>(d) In addition to further study taking account of points raised above, we
                        would need to consider whether we wished to make any informal agreement
                        subject only to similar Soviet restraint.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comments on Point 3—A Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty</p>
                    <p>(a) I think it is not quite accurate to state that the Soviets “have given no
                        indication as yet that they would be prepared to permit any on-site
                        inspection.” It would be more accurate to note that the Soviets have
                        withdrawn their earlier offer of three on-site inspections and persistently
                        state that no on-site inspections will be allowed.</p>
                    <p>(b) I agree heartily that we should initiate a priority review of the US
                        position, but until this is done I believe we should not press the Soviets.
                        Given their firmly stated position, I think it would be misleading to tell
                        them that in our view “a treaty at an early date is feasible.” I am pleased
                        to see that you suggest that such a review should include a reappraisal of
                        the impact on the military balance of possible undetected violations; I
                        think it should also include reappraisal of the expectations for military
                        gains from future underground testing both by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the US. In addition, the political effects of a
                        comprehensive test ban should, of course, be included.</p>
                    <p>(c) With respect to the provision for assurance that weapons development
                        shots are not disguised as peaceful detonations, my understanding is that
                        only sophisticated devices could be successfully used and I therefore do not
                        see how the assurance suggested could be obtained without revealing US
                        technology on any shots we undertake.<note n="5" xml:id="d55fn5">In the

                        Reductions</p>
                    <p>(a) In the discussion, the Soviet proposal for a nuclear umbrella is
                        described as an alternative to our freeze proposal. It is, however, not
                        offered as a corollary measure but as part of the <gloss target="#t_GCD1">GCD</gloss> plan. In addition, while the Soviets have not been precise,
                        I think it is more accurate to say that the Soviets have indicated the
                        number of strategic delivery vehicles which they envisage for the umbrella
                        is very small, rather than “relatively small”; that they have in mind parity
                        of numbers, rather than application of any percentage reduction; and that
                        they have specified informally that only land-based <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s could be allowed.</p>
                    <p>(b) At the time of earlier consideration of this question, the Principals
                        rejected a freeze coupled with reductions and especially the possibility of
                        variable reductions under which the US might cut a large number of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s than would the Soviets. I would not
                        object to reconsideration <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0180"/>of this
                        question, but I believe it clearly deserves further study before any
                        discussion with the Soviets.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> Sites</p>
                    <p>(a) I think the proposal to halt construction of new <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> sites is the most
                        promising of the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposals from the
                        point of view of Soviet acceptance, even though its implementation now would
                        freeze a US advantage. We should, however, decide on a clearly defined
                        proposal before initiating exploratory discussions with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>(b) Military consequences of the <gloss target="#t_SNDV1">SNDV</gloss> freeze
                        have already been assessed and found satisfactory, as the paper notes. I am
                        not, however, certain that an assessment of the consequences of
                        implementation of a freeze only on certain land-based launch sites can be
                        based on an assessment of a much broader proposed measure. Incidentally, I
                        think there might well be a problem with respect to sites partly constructed
                        at the time of any agreement.</p>
                    <p>(c) <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s are included on page 2, but their
                        inclusion is left in the air on page 12. We continue to be concerned about
                        the possible destabilizing effect of any freeze on strategic offensive
                        delivery systems which would not also include strategic defensive systems.
                        At the same time, I question whether we should tie our hand on this matter
                        at a time when we are still considering the advantages of damage-limiting
                        capability, and such questions as the value of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> for dealing with potential small Chinese Communist
                        intercontinental capabilities in the 1970's.</p>
                    <p>(d) I very much doubt if the Soviets would cooperate in excluding seaborne
                        strategic delivery launchers, particularly since this would facilitate
                        agreement on an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. However, if they were
                        to agree to such a provision we would probably have pushed them toward a
                        buildup in a submarine launch system.</p>
                    <p>(e) A proposal limited to <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, while it
                        has certain advantages from our point of view, would also provoke Allied
                        concern as to whether the US was reaching agreement advantageous to North
                        America without equal regard for the Soviet missile threat to Western
                        Europe. Assuming, however, that we could deal with these concerns, we might
                        find new pressures rising for a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        land-based <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> system.</p>
                    <p>(f) The proposed 18-24 month moratorium “pending negotiation of a freeze (on
                        site construction? on vehicles?) with provision for verification” would
                        probably vitiate considerably our bargaining power for agreement on
                        verification. The onus for withdrawal and resumption of deployment, if
                        agreement were not reached on verification, would rest on the US.</p>
                    <p>(g) I believe the problem of the sufficiency and perishability of US
                        unilateral intelligence collection capability requires careful
                        consideration. Moreover, the question would doubtless be posed as to why, if
                        the <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0181"/>US is confident that it could
                        detect <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deployments, it needs to
                        overfly Cuba. I don't say that this question cannot be answered, but we
                        would be faced with the need to give a rather precise reply. Finally, our
                        general position on inspection for disarmament might be undercut.</p>

                        Affairs, with assistance from colleagues, discussed the problems posed by

                        would identify the U.S. as a major supplier or collaborator.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kitchen emphasized the difficulty in discriminating within the “gray
                        areas” of exchanges, i.e. transfers that would neither “significantly affect
                        …” the French as in the case of major military systems or sub-systems nor
                        make no significant contribution. Efforts within the past six months,
                        centered in the Department of State with technical assistance from other
                        agencies, have not been successful in identifying broadly applicable
                        categories beyond specific end items, which even then, because of
                        conflicting policy considerations can only be regulated on a “case-by-case”
                        basis. He emphasized that ample legal authority for controls exist, but that
                        we remain deficient in the ability to discriminate clearly and efficiently.
                        Mentioning computers as a case in point, he cited pending transfers of a
                        Control Data Corporation machine to the French weapons laboratory and an
                        advanced IBM machine to the French Atomic Energy Authority for general
                        research. Despite obvious French intentions with regard to these machines,
                        Mr. Kitchen pointed to the hardships and likely retaliation to U.S.
                        corporations and their European affiliates and the availability to the
                        French of alternate facilities in Europe, should the sales be denied. Dr.
                        York on the other hand, emphasized the material handicaps to weapons
                        scientists of not having ready physical access to an appropriate computer,
                        and suggested the significance of sales to the French be judged on the basis
                        of their relation to overall laboratory expenditures. Mr. Kitchen pointed to
                        the special and unsolved problems of regulating transfers where a domestic
                        French company is controlled or partly owned by a U.S. supplier itself
                        subject to effective control.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Perkins emphasized the potential wide sweep of <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294, overriding any narrow interpretation of its scope,
                        through its provision barring the appearance of assistance to the French
                        weapons program. He, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>,
                        and Dr. York joined in identifying four dimensions of the export problem to
                        France: —normal commercial relations, the direct current effort to hamper
                        French weapons production, fulfillment of previous commitments to the French
                        (e.g. submarine reactor U-235), and the indirect provision of assistance
                        through Euratom. Mr. Kitchen emphasized the lack of intelligence and
                        experience with the impact of exchanges of French weapons production
                        sufficient to serve as a base for firm discrimination (although he said
                            <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294 merely confirms long-standing
                            <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0183"/>policy), and said that the
                        French are now subtly trying to probe the inadequately coordinated U.S.
                        control mechanism to achieve maximum advantage. Consideration, meanwhile, is
                        now being given to the problems of broadening the <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss>'s application to other countries.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. U.S. Response to Pressures for Proliferation</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt W. Rostow</persName>, Counselor of the
                        Department of State, presented a broad review of the factors making for
                        proliferation and of U.S. policy alternatives, based on his paper “A Way of
                        Thinking About Nuclear Proliferation,”<note n="4" xml:id="d56fn4">Not
                        found.</note> supplemented by comments about individual countries. He traced
                        our current policies back to the Post-War Baruch plan, and forward to the
                        prospect of eventual arms control, emphasizing that meanwhile it is
                        insufficient to try to stop proliferation to the exclusion of considering
                        other U.S. objectives. He contrasted Soviet policy since 1956 (overhanging
                        threat of nuclear war, pressure on Berlin as a divisive issue in the West,
                        and maneuvers to get U.S. to start conflict) against successful U.S.
                        policies of shoring up world security while working to lessen tension.
                        Proliferation now holds the dangers of increasing the risk of war and posing
                        a “dilemma of commitment” through U.S. efforts to maintain a more dangerous
                        balance or withdrawal from exposed position. Alternatively, U.S. should seek
                        to strengthen factors working against proliferation by (1) “giving our
                        allies knowledge and maturity about the inherently collective nature of the
                        deterrent,” (2) emphasizing other routes to prestige than national weapons
                        production, and (3) enhancing the “credibility and relevance to security of
                        U.S. military power.”</p>
                    <p>With respect to Europe, Mr. Rostow referred to a “package” of measures under
                        consideration in the Policy Planning Council, including consultation,
                        commitments to collective negotiation, and the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>. He saw evolution in
                        Britain since her first achievement of an independent deterrent, and in
                        Germany “an overwhelming vote against an independent nuclear force.” If the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> fails to come to pass, he saw the
                        need in Germany for either an extension of current bilateral relations with
                        the U.S. or a link-up with the French, with whom the Germans are now
                        “utterly at cross-purposes.” The <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>,
                        however, offers the Germans “prestige along with participation, and
                        increasing credibility to the deterrent.” If the U.S. maintained its veto,
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would be a logical <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0184"/>extension of our two-key arrangements to
                        meet the need for substitutions for the MMRBM and obsolescent QRA aircraft.
                        He indicated four steps that would give substance to our evolving European
                        posture:</p>
                    <p>(1) Repeal the 1958 Atomic Energy Act amendment allowing transfers of
                        military nuclear information when a country has made “substantial progress”
                        in its own weapons capability, an implicit reward for undertaking weapons
                        development.</p>
                    <p>(2) Secure a non-acquisition pledge from the Germans as an element of the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>(3) Encourage the British to publish a white paper on the fruitlessness of
                        their independent deterrent.</p>
                    <p>(4) Dramatize our readiness for serious arms control negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Kistiakowsky pointed to technical anachronisms in the mixed-manning
                        approach of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, stating that such
                        procedures are more suitable to systems more dependent upon cooperative
                        human performance.</p>
                    <p>Outside of Europe, Mr. Rostow pointed to the need to avoid premature U.S.
                        reinsurance or “loss of options” in the wake of the Chicom explosion. Japan
                        needed an outlet for its technology in support of its security, perhaps
                        through an Asian <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> or weapons pool. In
                        India, there will be difficulty in getting compatible U.S. and Russian
                        commitments; Mr. Rostow notes deep nationalism in Indian youth, awareness of
                        the costs of a nuclear deterrent, and a need for demonstration of
                        technological success. A pool of weapons available to both India and
                        Pakistan for defense against external attack might be suitable to deal with
                        their mutual suspicion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Henry Rowen (<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>) predicted a difficult defense problem for the Indians,
                        should they elect to achieve their own deterrent in the face of what will
                        probably be a sophisticated Chinese program. He posed the need for serious
                        and urgent U.S. study of steps necessary if we sought to discourage Indian
                        efforts, specifically including the content and form of a treaty, the
                        commitments necessary to make U.S. guarantees credible, the secrecy of our
                        commitments, and the partners we would seek to involve (i.e. Russia?).</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Status of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>Ambassador Gerard Smith (Special Assistant to the Secretary/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, Department of State) outlined the history
                        and objectives of the Multilateral Force proposal, beginning with the
                        post-Sputnik decision of the North Atlantic Council to provide an
                        intermediate range force for SACEUR and European access to tactical nuclear
                        weapons. The <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is not proliferation, he
                        said, because it represents an affirmative step to stop the loss of control
                        over nuclear weapons and the loss of design data to other countries, while
                        the U.S. exercises its necessary affirmative vote. In response to a
                        question, Ambassador Smith acknowledged that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0185"/>ships could be overpowered and
                        seized, but not without risk of war. Any exposure of design data would be
                        comparable to what our allies have already. Soviet surveillance and control
                        would not be possible short of installation of extensive satellite systems,
                        due to Western Europe's extensive coastal waters making evasion simple.
                        Capital cost of the MLF was put at $2.3 billion for a 25-ship force, with
                        $160 million annual operating expenses.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Underground Nuclear Testing</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH8">Harold Brown</persName> (Director, Defense
                        Research and Engineering) discussed military aspects of a comprehensive
                        nuclear test ban treaty, which he said would probably slightly favor the
                        U.S. Detection capabilities available in 3-5 years will enable the U.S. to
                        detect down to 0.0 kiloton in granite, 0.2 kt in tuff and 1/2-1 kt in
                        alluvium. This would result in some 20+10 unidentified events above the
                        present detection threshold of 1 kt in granite. He suggested that 2 or 3
                        inspections with these capabilities would provide the same level of
                        protection as 7-8 under the previously assumed capabilities. The utility of
                        continued testing relates to (a) effects tests bearing on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> technology, (b) yield-to-weight
                        improvements, and (c) tactical weapons developments. He emphasized that
                        improved accuracy was more important than increased yield-to-weight ratios.
                        The need for inspection remains, however, to identify suspicious events, to
                        underpin political sanctions, and to serve as a precedent for other
                        disarmament agreements. Dr. Brown believes our own underground testing to
                        date has been more fruitful than that of the Soviets. He discounted the
                        practicability and significance of deep-hole testing, simultaneous shots, or
                        timing to accompany an earthquake. In regard to proliferation, however, Dr.
                        Brown downgraded the significance of an all-environments test ban treaty, to
                        stop proliferation because others need not adhere, weapons can be stockpiled
                        without testing (although political prestige of an explosion would not be
                        achievable), and because a “substantial measure of disarmament and action
                        against the self-nuclearizers” would be more effective. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KSMJ1">Keeny</persName> asked whether this conclusion was
                        not based on the questionable assumption that countries such as India and
                        Japan would not sign such a treaty and that if they did sign, there would be
                        much less incentive for them to test since they would lose the political
                        prestige and military deterrent value of testing. Dr. Brown concluded that:
                        “It is hard to conclude that a comprehensive test ban would be a serious
                        mistake, since there are no substantial military disadvantages; it would
                        probably be a net plus.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. Brown saw a need for continued R&amp;D on land-mobile
                        air-transportable <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s that could be moved
                        every few hours. Though not as good as the original MMRBM concept (inertial
                        guidance, trucks, 5-minute firing), they would be usable under appropriate
                        control in Europe, the Far East and Southeast Asia. An <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system sufficient to protect the <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0186"/>U.S. from disparate threats could
                        be effective to shore up U.S. damage-limiting strategy, based on
                        modifications of an enhanced Nike-X system. Where a $25 billion system is
                        estimated against a Soviet attack to reduce casualties from 100 million to
                        40 million people, a $5 billion system (plus fall-out shelter) against a
                        less sophisticated threat could bring casualties down from 30 million to
                        about 10 million or fewer. Other threats change the equation (suit-case
                        bombs, ship-launched missiles, aircraft).</p>
                    <p>He posed the alternative to expensive guarantees to discourage Nth country
                        development of a U.S. defensive capability against modest strategic threats.
                        “There is a discount rate to trouble, just as there is to money.” However,
                        he anticipated no major foreseeable breakthroughs in military technology,
                        although the Chinese could mount an earlier threat to the U.S. through
                        400-mile missiles launched from ships than from <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s. He saw “no overwhelming losses” if Plowshare is delayed
                        for 10 years.</p>

                        views under consideration in the Department of State reviews of problems of

                    <p>I believe that we have reached a crisis point in our efforts to develop
                        concrete proposals to carry out the President's stated objective in the arms
                        control field. In the attached memorandum to Bill Foster (Tab A),<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">

                        has recommended for discussion with the Soviets in their memorandum to the
                        Committee of Principals (Tab B)<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">Regarding these
                                <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> recommendations, see <ref target="#d55fn2">footnote 2, Document 55</ref>.</note> that we
                        discussed last week.</p>
                    <p>As I pointed out previously, I understand that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> is prepared to support all of the
                            <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposals and that General
                            <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> has indicated his
                        willingness to go along with all of the proposals except the item on the
                        moratorium on construction of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> sites which he wishes to consider
                        further. It is my own judgment that the proposals are clearly in conformity
                        with the President's stated arms control objectives; and that, if properly
                        handled, all of the proposals are to our net security advantage.</p>
                    <p>The attached memorandum from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> is really a remarkable document that essentially calls
                        into question our entire arms control and non-proliferation policy. I call
                        your attention in particular to the second paragraph that characterizes in
                        classic fashion a foreign policy based on a desire to react to external
                        events rather than to influence them.</p>
                    <p>Although I agree with several of the detailed points made in the <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> memorandum, I am afraid it is
                        basically a collection of arguments designed to assure that no action will
                        be taken in this field in the foreseeable future. I am particularly
                        concerned about their comments on the comprehensive test ban. While at first
                        glance these comments appear to be only a delaying action, I am afraid they
                        are in fact an effort to reopen the whole issue despite rather clear U.S.
                        policy in this area. Among other things, the memo implies that there is no
                        possibility that the Soviets will consider inspection with a comprehensive
                        test ban. I do not think that we <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0188"/>should take this for granted. (For your information, Mr. Faber, First
                        Secretary of the British Embassy, reported to me today that a member of the
                        Soviet Embassy in London had told a senior British official informally that
                        he thought his government would be prepared to return to its original
                        position of 2 or 3 on-site inspections.)<note n="4" xml:id="d57fn4">No
                            record of this conversation has been found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>There are a number of useful points in the <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> memorandum, however, I believe that most of these
                        could easily be taken care of on an informal staff basis and are not
                        critical to the proposals. In general, I share the basic concern that <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> has not done its homework better in
                        spelling out the details of their proposals. On the other hand, these are
                        not new ideas; we have studied the problems (e.g., comprehensive test ban)
                        in great depth and are now presumably interested in indicating to the
                        Soviets our desire to move forward and in determining what general proposals
                        the Soviets might be prepared to pursue. More specifically, I share State's
                        concern that the 18-24 month moratorium on construction of sites might be
                        difficult to get out of and would complicate our subsequent bargaining
                        position on verification rights. To minimize these effects, the time period,
                        if any, should be short, the arrangement informal, and our future actions
                        closely coupled with Soviet activities in this area. I agree also that
                        Plowshare presents a serious problem under the comprehensive test ban. In
                        order to avoid unacceptable risks or a meaningless treaty, we may have to
                        exclude Plowshare initially with a provision that this subject be
                        re-examined after a few years. However, this problem is one that we can
                        resolve internally and is not immediately involved in reopening the dialogue
                        on this question with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>I think it is most important that the <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> memorandum does not become the State Department's
                        formal position. If it does, the President will be faced with a serious
                        problem that the State Department is effectively preventing the pursuit of
                        his stated policy on arms control and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Bill Foster is going to recommend that you call a special meeting of the
                        Committee of Principals next Monday in the Situation Room to discuss this
                            problem.<note n="5" xml:id="d57fn5">

                    <p>Throughout 1964 officials in the Johnson administration discussed the wisdom
                        and timing of Project Sulky, a proposed Plowshare test in nuclear
                        excavation. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> called
                        for a Department of State report on the proposed event in <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 282, February 11 (<ref target="#d7">Document 7</ref>).</p>
                    <p>Upon completion of the Department of State report, May 7 (<ref target="#d27">Document 27</ref>), the Review Committee on Underground Nuclear Tests
                        discussed the recommendations in the report. In a June 26 memorandum to
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, Brigadier General
                        Harry L. Evans, Alternate Representative of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Chairman to the Review Committee on Underground Nuclear Tests,
                        reported that the conclusions in the report were “sound” but recommended
                        that the timing of the recommended actions be considered by the Review
                        Committee. <persName corresp="#p_BH8">Harold Brown</persName>, Director of

                        concluded that the recommendations were “generally sound” but opposed the
                        suggestion that foreign observers be invited to witness the initial
                        Plowshare type of test, and he recommended that the proposed Sulky test “be
                        carried out before there is any public announcement of the event, either in
                        this country or abroad.” He also urged that the results of this shot and
                        possibly other cratering events should be evaluated before any action is
                        taken to negotiated changes in, or exceptions to, the Limited Test Ban

                        further, and an “implicit approval to the Sulky shot in December was given.”
                            (<persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, Volume 9, page 33) On July 20, Bundy sent a memorandum to

                        “the desirability of conducting Project Sulky sometime in December.” The

                    <p>The Secretary opened by expressing appreciation that this Committee is
                        working on the proliferation problem, and said that he was awaiting its
                        recommendations with interest. The US opposes nuclear proliferation. Each
                        nuclear power does not wish to see further proliferation. Thus it is easy
                        for the US to speak out against proliferation, but the Prime Minister of
                        India or Japan must look on the question quite differently. The problem of
                        alternatives to national nuclear proliferation arises. It is easier to see
                        solutions in cases where firm defense alliances with the US exist, e.g.,
                        Japan and the Philippines. The solution is not so clear or easy in a case
                        such as India. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> doubts the
                        US commitment even in Europe—it is much easier to have such doubt in distant
                        areas not traditionally bound to us. Moreover, do we want to give guarantees
                        which would guarantee that we will be involved at the risk of 100 to 150
                        million lives ten years from now in the face of possible Sino-Soviet
                        alliances? An Asian nuclear defense community, perhaps with a US nuclear
                        stockpile available for it to draw upon, may be one solution. A commonwealth
                        nuclear committee for South Asia may be an answer; the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is ready to commit its nuclear force in

                        support for her commitment East of Suez. In general, a different
                        organization of nuclear arrangements will probably be necessary.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                        Gaulle</persName> had said to him that unless the nuclear powers physically
                        suppress proliferation, it is inevitable.<pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0191"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> opposes, and does not
                        expect, such suppression. On the other hand, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> has indicated that France would not disseminate
                        nuclear weapons to anyone, including Germany. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is more optimistic on agreements to curb proliferation.</p>
                    <p>We have long sought a non-proliferation agreement; the Soviets have opposed
                        it ostensibly because of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, but really
                        because of their more basic opposition to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Secretary noted that he had inquired of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> with respect to Warsaw Pact
                        arrangements, and had mentioned reports of Soviet nuclear aid to China in
                        the 1950's. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> made no comment
                        on the Warsaw Pact, but said only that we should not listen to rumors with
                        respect to Soviet aid to China.<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2">See <ref target="#d53">Document 53</ref>.</note> In fact, the Secretary
                        added, we did not know if they did anything more than assist the Chinese
                        peaceful nuclear program. Soviet interest in non-proliferation is 95 percent
                        centered on the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, just as we have been on
                        China. The Secretary suggested that Soviet interest in the partial test ban
                        in 1963 seemed to be based in part on a hope to restrain Communist China.
                        This, however, is inference, since the Soviets steadfastly refuse to discuss
                        China with us. For a long time the Soviets played down Chinese nuclear
                        development, until shortly before the Chinese test.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> asked the Secretary
                        whether he had reassured the Soviets on the US veto and European clause in
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The Secretary replied that he had.
                        He had pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was a move
                        against proliferation and it was the Soviets who had put the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in the nuclear picture by targetting them.
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> arrangements would not give the
                        Germans control of nuclear weapons nor would the Germans acquire nuclear
                        weapons technology through it. In fact, he had pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would be more secure than existing <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> arrangements. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> kept objecting that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was only the “first step” to a German capability. The Secretary
                        noted that he had replied that the Soviets should then sign up on a
                        non-proliferation agreement which would commit us all to the proposition
                        that this “first step” was also the “last step.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented that if the Soviets can use
                        an issue to divide the West, they do so. Also, to the extent that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would strengthen the Alliance, they also
                        oppose it. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> added
                        that the Soviets also oppose an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> because
                        it would establish a longer term and closer knitting together of the US with
                        Europe in defense.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then raised the question of nuclear free zones, stating that we
                        were favorably inclined toward such zones in Latin America and Africa,
                        assuming the problem of transit rights were worked out, because there would
                        be no need for the nuclear powers to target these areas. Other areas are too
                        closely involved both with the presence of nuclear <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0192"/>weapons, and as potential nuclear targets.
                        In the Far East there is a special problem of requiring an alternative to
                        conventional forces for meeting the enormous Chinese masses. We therefore
                        oppose the Chinese Communist proposal for no first use of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>General Gruenther asked the Secretary if he would comment further on France.
                        The Secretary drew attention to the extreme sensitivity of the information
                        he was about to give. For <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>,
                        the French nuclear program is strictly political, not military. There is a
                        touch of Poincare in <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s view
                        that France must have a special place, and is only safe when Germany is in a
                        secondary position. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        objects that an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would give Germany a
                        preferred position, though France has always been invited to have that same
                        opportunity. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is not yet
                        prepared to say that Europe should organize its defenses entirely separately
                        from the US. He would preserve the Alliance, while giving Europe an
                        independent ability to bring the US in. Messmer did say that France would
                        talk about coordinating nuclear targetting with us when the Force de Frappe
                        was ready.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that strategy is discussed in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on three levels: (1) Deterrence—with a premium on telling
                        the opponent that all hell would break loose right away; (2) the question of
                        how to wage combat—for example, there has been full agreement on the
                        measured use of force in our Berlin contingency planning; and (3) talk about
                        strategy, by those (such as <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                        Gaulle</persName>) who assume there will be no war, and therefore manipulate
                        strategic questions for present political purposes. Our forces are under the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Guidelines; the French are not.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted the French
                        justification for the Force de Frappe. Pompidou has said that [<hi rend="italic">6 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. Recently
                        Raymond Aron has also written an article contending that proliferation is

                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary raised the problem of US actions with respect to the French
                        nuclear program. To begin with, we are clearly obligated not to transgress
                        the provisions of the partial test ban. But there is a difficult question of
                        where, beyond that, we should draw the line. The US has never openly opposed
                        or adopted sanctions against the French program. Nor for that matter, the
                        Secretary said, will US sanctions stop the French. We do not want out of
                        vexation to open a spiral of economic reprisal and retaliation. Should we
                        not sell to France that which we would sell to other Allies? Finally, there
                        would be particularly serious consequences of attempting to stir up
                        resistance to the French program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>
                        <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0193"/>noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had earlier stated that the French
                        expect such a policy of us. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        replied that there were problems on the border line, but that we have not
                        tried to use our power in the way the French might have if they were in our
                        place. General Gruenther asked how the French react to our decisions on the
                        sale of computers. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted
                        particularly the problem of a nuclear weapons laboratory as a designated
                        recipient. Mr. Watson, remarking that he was not speaking from the
                        standpoint of a selfish interest, raised the question of possible repressive
                        retaliation by the French against a company with large assets in France. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed that we must look
                        hard at this problem and that the French might use such instances as an
                        excuse for action against American subsidiaries. The current instance of
                        artificial limitations on the dollar element in the French treasury reserve
                        is an example of political interjection.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> asked the Secretary's
                        view on what the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would do if the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> does
                        not come into being. The Secretary replied that the German elections this
                        year might make a difference. But more generally, in the long run the
                        Germans would face a choice between two solutions: (1) joint development
                        with France in a European force, or (2) a national nuclear weapons program.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> remarked that Germany would
                        probably first of all turn to us for bilateral arrangements with <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s in Germany under the two-key system. The
                        Secretary remarked that the Germans seem to have drawn away from the idea of
                        placing <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s on their own territory, where
                        they would attract additional fire. He believed the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would probably reject <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                        Gaulle</persName>'s terms for collaboration in a basically French controlled
                        force, so that in the long run the pressure would be for a German nuclear
                        capability. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>
                        suggested the Germans might also increase pressure for more tactical nuclear
                        weapons. The Secretary stated his agreement with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> that in the first instance the
                        Germans would seek bigger and better bilateral arrangements with the US, but
                        that later they would seek their own. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> remarked that many German ministers and others have been
                        saying that without an alliance nuclear arrangement there will inevitably be
                        pressures for a German nuclear force. The Secretary said that when Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had asked von Hassel
                        why the latter wanted an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, he replied
                        that he wanted it first to tie the US to Germany [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2
                            lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. Mr. McCloy noted that Erler
                        of the SPD is also concerned over eventual pressures for a German force. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that after World War I
                        four restrictions had been placed on German rearmament, but three went by
                        the board very quickly, and the last by 1936. We can not make the Germans
                        into second-class citizens. We can not subject them to a discriminatory
                        state of original sin. In the first place, the Germans themselves would not
                        put up with it, and in the second place, over time the West itself would
                        refuse to press such discrimination. The Germans had <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0194"/>already spent $850 million in atomic energy
                        research. The Secretary said that in Adenauer's last year as Chancellor he
                        had privately declared that the <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>
                        restrictions were no longer binding by virtue of rebus sic stantibus.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> inquired whether, if we have
                        to give the Germans an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, does it not mean
                        the Soviets would not agree to non-proliferation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that the Germans will not sign a
                        non-proliferation agreement except in a situation in which they participate
                        in nuclear defense arrangements. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> asked whether it would be possible to put more
                        pressure for German reunification. The Secretary replied that very morning
                        the German Ambassador had told him, not officially under instructions, that
                        there was German thinking along lines of holding back from any further
                        commitments on nuclear non-proliferation as a bargaining counter for
                            reunification.<note n="4" xml:id="d59fn4">A memorandum of Ambassador

                            on this matter is in Department of State, Central Files, DEF (<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>).</note> The Secretary further
                        commented in reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName>'s
                        question that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> does not involve
                        proliferation. It would, on the contrary, deal with the German appetite for
                        a nuclear role on a basis of equal participation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> noted that the Soviet delegates still
                        oppose an agreement providing for an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. He
                        asked whether this means abandoning a non-proliferation agreement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles noted that we all agree that non-proliferation is desirable; the
                        problem is in costs. We apparently need a big effort, with many kinds of
                        measures, to have much chance of success. He then asked the Secretary if he
                        would sacrifice a great deal in terms of other policies in order to get
                        non-proliferation. The Secretary replied that when faced with this question
                        we had not decided in 1956-57 to launch an all-out effort against France,
                        with threats and the like. We probably could not have succeeded even if we
                        had tried. And we have not struck China to deal with its nuclear program.
                        Non-proliferation is not the overriding element in US relations with the
                        rest of the world. In individual cases—e.g., the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>/Israel—it could become dominant. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> asked how we can approach the
                        problem on a case-by-case basis when each case has so much impact on others.
                        The Secretary replied that each case is different. India may face a nuclear
                        attack; the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> does not. They must be dealt
                        with differently. In general, the Secretary added, there is probably more
                        time to deal with this problem in the Alliance than with respect to India,
                        Israel, etc. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> asked what
                        the terms might be if we decided that it was definitely in our interest that
                        India remain non-nuclear. The Secretary replied that the Indians want
                        guarantees from the Soviets and from us. We do not think that a joint
                        guarantee with the Soviets would be feasible or desirable, and we do not
                        believe the Soviets would grant a meaningful effective guarantee. Perhaps
                        some Commonwealth <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0195"/>arrangement can
                        be reached providing nuclear weapons to support India in time of crisis. In
                        further reply to Mr. Dulles, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        noted that it was necessary to give these potential nuclear powers something
                        concrete in order to get them to give up the nuclear option. A mere general
                        undertaking would otherwise probably be no more effective than the
                        Kellogg-Briand Pact. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName>
                        questioned whether we would be giving a blank check to India to do whatever
                        it wanted. The Secretary agreed that the question of guarantees opened a
                        difficult chain of problems. He stated that he did not favor one-way US
                        guarantees; an alliance with reciprocal obligations, or to meet certain
                        specified conditions, might be another matter. But a conditional guarantee
                        satisfactory to us might not be sufficiently satisfying to India. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> asked what would happen if
                        Japan and India sign a non-proliferation agreement, then later when under
                        threat asked for our assistance and we did not give it—would not the
                        credibility of our commitments in general go down the drain. The Secretary
                        replied that he considered the situation covered in cases where we have an
                        alliance like Japan but not in other cases. Mr. McCloy asked the Secretary
                        if he regarded Indian policy as a complete change from the time of Nehru.
                        The Secretary replied that present Indian policy was not basically
                        different. After all, Nehru had moved into Kashmir, Hyderabad, Ladakh, and
                        Goa. The Indians are probably already working on the first stages of
                        preparation for nuclear weapons if they later decide to proceed. Changes in
                        Indian policy are due more to circumstances than to changes in the
                        leadership. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> left the
                        meeting at approximately this stage in the conversation.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. McCloy remarked that while we were talking about the price of
                        proliferation, he was concerned about the price of dissolving the Alliance.
                        He expressed the view that <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 322<note n="5" xml:id="d59fn5">“Guidelines for Discussions on the Nuclear Defense
                            of the Atlantic Alliance,” December 1, 1964. (Johnson Library, National
                            Security File, National Security Action Memorandums, <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 322, Box 5)</note> placed the ball in
                        the court of the Europeans, who can't handle it. He had received ominous
                        views from Germany and Brussels of our stepping back from leadership. Is the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> out? Mr. McCloy noted that Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had said he would give
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> at most a 50 percent chance. Without
                        arm twisting, we must nonetheless lead. The Secretary replied that he
                        considered the idea of the Europeans looking to us for a lead as phony. They
                        all want us to “lead” in different directions. The Europeans now feel
                        secure, not under threat from the East. This gives them the luxury of
                        playing around in pursuit of other objectives. With respect to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> we had attempted to respond to the European
                        view that something was needed. After waiting a year or two after Nassau we
                        said that we would then show them a way. There was at that time no serious
                        objection in the Alliance and eight <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0196"/>countries showed serious positive interest. Lord Home said privately that
                        they would go along with the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> after the
                        election. We went further along the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> path
                        before meeting real objection in the Alliance. Then, in October 1964, France
                        suddenly got worried about its success and the Scandinavians hardened their
                        position from non-participation to opposition. The Secretary remarked that
                        when he was in Paris the Quai had remarked to the press the incorrect notion
                        that he would ask <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> to
                        coordinate the Force de Frappe with SAC and the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName>
                        <note n="6" xml:id="d59fn6">British Secretary of State for Foreign
                        Affairs.</note> quickly objected, of course, to that idea. Meanwhile, Italy
                        wants a special role with Germany in a Directoire of five. Mr. McCloy
                        remarked that if not the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, we need
                        something to keep the Western community together. He did not like the idea
                        of dropping the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> just to suit the Soviets
                        and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. The Secretary said
                        that was not the point. Italy and Germany will next take the lead, then with
                        the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and then with us. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> will meet this month. Moreover, there is more
                        maneuver in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> position than has been
                        disclosed so far. There is a strong impetus to do something with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> nuclear deterrent. The problem of control in
                        the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> is open—the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> wants the veto for all principal members; Germany does not
                        want the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to have a veto. But the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will eventually come through, even on
                        participation in an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> surface fleet
                        component. In Germany the situation is complicated by the fact the present
                        government does not want to give the SPD any chance for credit. Mr. McCloy
                        reiterated his concern over talks among the Germans, Italians, and British
                        without us. The Secretary replied that we will continue to be deeply
                        involved, but that we must stand back from the position of appearing to be
                        out in front of the rest, where we had been with the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. It is, he noted, essential to present the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> to Congress as a unifying measure in the
                        Alliance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Perkins inquired whether the Secretary wished to comment on the relation
                        of this subject to German reunification. The Secretary replied that the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>,
                        as we had indicated to others, would not be permitted to stand in the way of
                        German reunification, the unity of Europe, or major disarmament.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> requested the
                        Secretary's view on the appropriate time to broach any non-proliferation
                        approaches to the Soviets. Should such approaches precede or follow the
                        Communist Party talks scheduled for March? The Secretary noted that we have
                        been talking with the Soviets, that there is an on-going dialogue, and that
                        we can approach them at any time that seems appropriate. He added that he
                        was concerned at present about possible erosion of the atmospheric test ban.
                        Mr. McCloy commented that General Wheeler had indicated that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> may oppose a comprehensive test ban. The
                        Secretary remarked that he did not see <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0197"/>urgency in seeking a comprehensive test ban at a time when
                        France and China are testing. The Soviets, he noted, will not yield on
                        inspection. He had discussed the question with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had made quite clear that inspection is for the
                        Soviets strictly a political question, and that they did not care about the
                        technical side of the question. Moreover, the Secretary continued, it was
                        not inconceivable that under some circumstances the Soviets might test
                        clandestinely in China. In response to a doubting interjection, the
                        Secretary recalled that the Stalin-Hitler Pact showed how two hostile
                        totalitarian states could sometimes get together very quickly when it suited
                        them. In conclusion, the Secretary stated that he was not convinced that a
                        comprehensive test ban would yield a major gain for non-proliferation.</p>
                    <p>(At this point, the Secretary was obliged to excuse himself to meet another
                        commitment, and suggested that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> take the chair.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> opened by
                        suggesting that the March meeting of the Communist Parties, as it occurs,
                        may tell us more about the Soviet position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> asked for the Ambassador's view on the signs of
                        displeasure in Moscow at the President's State of the Union address.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> emphasized that
                        Moscow's behavior at the moment is largely conditioned on their expectation
                        with respect to the March meeting. He stated that for the Soviet leaders
                        five other things take priority over general relations with the West: (1)
                        consolidation of their power; (2) dealing with crucial internal problems
                        left by <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>; (3) dealing with
                        the East Europeans; (4) dealing with Communist China; and (5) relations with
                        other Communist Parties around the world. Under these conditions, the Soviet
                        leaders seek to remain loose and flexible. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> added that he believes the Chinese
                        Communists will force a split in the movement, despite the fact that the
                        Soviets have shrunk back from forcing a split. Dr. York inquired why this
                        should be so. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>
                        responded by noting that the Chinese were doing well in splitting the
                        Communist movement, especially in Asia. The Chinese leaders also feel that
                        it benefits them, especially with respect to Taiwan, whenever they can raise
                        hell anywhere for the US. The Soviets, by contrast, are playing a
                        longer-range game of establishing their presence and influence in various
                        areas without wildly provoking outbreaks. The Chinese have very real
                        tactical and strategic differences with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles asked whether the Soviets are really very interested in
                        non-proliferation. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> stated that he did not believe so, except for their
                        concern over West Germany. The Soviets did make threats when, several years
                        ago, the Swiss considered developing a nuclear weapons capability, and have
                        pressed the Swedes. But in some other areas they may be inclined to see
                        problems caused for us.</p>
                    <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0198"/>
                    <p>Mr. McCloy asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>
                        for his views of the possibilities of a Sino-Soviet rapprochement.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said that he
                        thought such a development was very remote, that all evidence points to the
                        depth of the split. Of course, as the Secretary has noted, for the very long
                        run we must consider all possibilities.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> raised a question
                        relating to putting pressure on Euratom. He indicated that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> had said that we should not
                        pressure Euratom because of the value of that institution to European unity,
                        even if Euratom was delinquent in permitting us to verify its
                            safeguards.<note n="7" xml:id="d59fn7">Reference may be to Seaborg's
                            briefing of the <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>
                            Committee the same morning. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> briefly summarized the briefing, as follows: “I
                            spoke for keeping our commitment to deliver 425 kilograms of plutonium
                            to Euratom (I believe I convinced them) for means of strengthening
                                <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards. I expressed my
                            feeling that Plowshare is worth striving for in a Comprehensive Test Ban
                            Treaty.” (<persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, Vol. 10, p. 21)</note> Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> replied that he believed
                        we should proceed with the scheduled plutonium transaction, not only for
                        reasons of supporting European unity but because failure to carry out a
                        commitment could have serious disadvantages. We have faced a similar problem
                        with South Africa. Many considerations enter such decisions, including the
                        availability of other suppliers. Mr. McCloy asked whether we wanted the
                        French to dominate Euratom. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> replied that this was not the case. Mr. Perkins
                        remarked that he had learned that the French serving in the Euratom staff
                        were by no means partisans of General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                        Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> expressed his thanks to
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> for the
                        opportunity to meet with the Secretary. He wanted to express his great
                        appreciation to the Secretary for having made Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL2">Garthoff</persName> available to assist the Committee.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> thanked Mr.

                        submit a draft of the Committee's conclusions, when such a draft is

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. General Review (January 8, 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> stated his preference
                        for a world with a limited number of nuclear powers, finding it implausible
                        that additional proliferation could be compartmentalized, quarantined, or
                        regionalized and comparing the consequences for the world of the Sarajevo
                        incident. He found it all the more unlikely that a nuclear conflict
                        involving 1.5 billion Chinese, Indians and Japanese could not affect our own
                        security. Furthermore, the United States is already committed to Asian
                        defense, both through treaty and through the President's October 18
                            message.<note n="3" xml:id="d60fn3">For the text of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s October 18, 1964, message,
                            see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United
                                States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>,
                                1964</hi>, Book II, pp. 1377-1380.</note> We cannot avoid fulfilling
                        these commitments and we have the power—more usable today than ever
                        before—to do so. The additional price, for example, $5 billion for an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, is not beyond our means, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> would wish to recommend to the
                        President that he make good on the course he's set for himself.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Webster said that he felt a rearguard action to keep proliferation to the
                        minimum is to some extent inevitable although the characterization is
                        perhaps oversimplified. He questioned whether we should be prepared to pay
                        the ultimate price to stop proliferation—for example, a nuclear umbrella to
                        India which might be too much temptation for Indian adventures; he would not
                        give the Indians the ultimate military guarantees. On the other hand, he
                        favored the taking of all steps reasonably necessary to slow proliferation,
                        to approach the problem on a case-by-case <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0200"/>basis. He felt he was nearer to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s “Model A” world than to “Model
                            B,”<note n="4" xml:id="d60fn4">In his briefing of the <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> Committee on January 7 (see
                                <ref target="#d60fn2">footnote 2</ref> above), <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> developed two models. In
                            “Model A” the United States would push for a world in which there were
                            no additional nuclear weapons nations; in “Model B” the United States
                            would acquiesce in a world in which there would be a limited amount of
                            further nuclear proliferation.</note> but not so close as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McCloy focused on the form of the guarantees that might be necessary,
                        feeling that thorough analysis is needed. He said that it is not the answer
                        alone to say that we have tremendous military power, but that we must
                        instead acknowledge the political limitations on the use of that power. We
                        have been convincing on our guarantees of Berlin, but the character of our
                        determination will be diluted if we have 20 such commitments and our
                        fundamental image of capability to defend the free world might be impaired.
                        He is not convinced that a guarantee is the price we should pay; as to
                        India, for example, we should try first to get an agreement to stop the
                        spread of nuclear weapons without offering an umbrella. Mr. Dulles
                        concurred.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McCloy went on to emphasize that it is “fantastic” to assume that the
                        problem of European security is solvable by the “other side” alone, as
                        suggested in <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 322. He feared that our
                        position in the Alliance is rapidly deteriorating and that we risk both
                        losing the Alliance and non-proliferation as well. We are going to have to
                        confront <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s belief that a
                        return to nationalism in the Twentieth Century is appropriate; nationalism
                        isn't adequate for conventional weapons and is not adequate for nuclear
                        weapons. Mr. McCloy thinks that the United States is drifting in a situation
                        where proliferation in Europe is more serious than in Asia or the Middle
                        East. He questioned the view that we owe the Germans nothing, emphasizing
                        that such an approach opened the door to German insecurity in the 1920s.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Watson said that the ideal is the “Model A” world although he was puzzled
                        by how we were to get it going without participation by the French. Soviet
                        cooperation, he felt, would be desirable, at the price of overcoming their
                        historical fears of Germany. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> suggested that perhaps at some time we may have to
                        give up the “Holy Grail” and move to a “Model B” world. Mr. Watson
                        emphasized that he was concerned with the need for a long-range plan for the
                        future of the Germans. At the same time he said that it is a terribly
                        dangerous course to repudiate France. He felt that some horse-trading would
                        be necessary to soften the blow to the French of making Germany the dominant
                        power in Europe. He said it was hard for him to see the practicality of
                        alienating both the French and the Russians in order to achieve an Allied
                        Nuclear Force.</p>
                    <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0201"/>
                    <p>Mr. McCloy added that we did the same before on both the Common Market and
                        the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and he felt that the Russians will
                        adjust once again, even though they hate Western unity. France's equivocal
                        position, Mr. McCloy said, was readily stiffened by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> because our approach to the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> has been so maladroit. Mr. McCloy
                        emphasized that a solid Western Community was far more important than
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and is the essential
                        basis for both the long-range prospects of disarmament and a modus vivendi,
                        even affecting China.</p>
                    <p>General Gruenther indicated that his views had changed in the course of the
                        study and that a “Model A” world is not impossible, stating that he feels we
                        have to go forward to achieve it whatever the cost. He felt that a principal
                        problem would be the selling of increased American commitments on India to
                        the American public.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles believed that we should begin with Course II as outlined in the
                        Committee's planning and move to Course III as we find targets of
                            opportunity.<note n="5" xml:id="d60fn5">Reference is to the undated and
                            unsigned planning paper for the <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> Committee, “Problems Concerning Alternative Course
                            of Action” (see <ref target="#d56fn6">footnote 6, Document 56</ref>),
                            which developed four possible courses, as follows: <p>“i. Course I.
                                Avoid costs and risks of trying to stop proliferation; attempt to
                                establish regional stability based upon new balances of power, in
                                the hope that the U.S. can avoid dangerous external involvements;
                                assist proliferation where useful in creating such stability (e.g.,
                                India and Japan as counter-balances to China).</p>
                            <p>“ii. Course II. Attempt to slow proliferation everywhere while at the
                                same time preserving other goals and avoiding major risks. Use the
                                extra time to learn to live with the problem.</p>
                            <p>“iii. Course III. Accept substantial costs and risks in exchange for
                                a materially increased probability of halting or greatly retarding
                                proliferation.</p>
                            <p>“iv. Course IV. All-out efforts to stop proliferation; most or all
                                other policies subordinated; acceptance of large costs now to avoid
                                greater costs in the future.” (Johnson Library, National Security
                                File, Committee File, Committee on Nuclear Proliferation, Chron
                                File, Box 5)</p>
                        </note> We have to be sure that when we move to more adventurous positions
                        we will be successful.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Kistiakowsky felt that for our own lifetime we might prefer to live in a
                        “Model B” world, but his thoughts about his grandchildren have changed his
                        mind and commit him strongly to seek the “Model A.” To term such action
                        rearguard, he believes, is a concession of defeat. We must wage a campaign
                        to keep proliferation at a minimum and be prepared to lose individual
                        battles, but not the overall war. First, we should be prepared to impose
                        pressures and present inducements to others. He felt the non-European world
                        is at least as important as Europe in the light of growth in population and
                        technological innovations. He is convinced that guarantees are essential to
                        security in this area but that they should not be given promiscuously. He
                        also thought that our own example will <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0202"/>be essential and that we should press measures of arms
                        limitation and increasing understanding with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> indicated that he, like
                        General Gruenther, had changed his views somewhat to support “Model A” if
                        the United States will pay the necessary costs. To succeed, he said, we must
                        involve the Soviet Union. In this context, he thought it wise that we weigh
                        reunification as an alternative to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. York came out squarely for “Model A.” Guarantees, he believes, are
                        possible, and in the short run at least, United States lives need not be at
                        stake in India to support a guarantee, although we must also be able to
                        withdraw from guarantees, if necessary. “With nervousness about the long
                        run, I am for 'Model A' as a goal for the short run.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. Perkins emphasized that proliferation is not the totality of United
                        States policy and that the subject should not be expanded until it covers
                        all of our interests and those of our allies. He also emphasized the need to
                        relate our short-run actions to long-range objectives. First, he felt we
                        should emphasize our conventional military option and seek to make it
                        convincing. In regard to peaceful uses of atomic energy, he felt our
                        restraints should be relatively mild because such restraints are not likely
                        to prove especially significant in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.
                        In addition, he had some distress about <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 322 and its exclusively regional basis. He is concerned that
                        we are seeking to get out of a difficult situation rather than to work out
                        an appropriate alternative. In the Far East, he felt that a strict treaty
                        with India is not necessary but that we should consider a regional
                        alternative, such as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in Europe, and to
                        this end, start conversations with the Indians, the Japanese and the
                        Filipinos to work out regional arrangements on a series of national
                        agreements. Internationally, he felt we should strive for the
                        non-proliferation and comprehensive test ban treaty, whether we are likely
                        to get them or not. We should beef up the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> to make it the inspectorial system around the world. In terms
                        of long-range objectives, he urged:</p>
                    <p>a. A beginning of considerations about United States-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> “sharing of nuclear power progressively,” which he defined
                        as two sharings between allies of the respective super-powers. (Dr. York
                        interjected that perhaps we should seek a United Nations Security Council
                        “that really runs the world.”)</p>
                    <p>b. With regard to the French, Dr. Perkins feels we are too optimistic to
                        think that our policies will change after <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> and that we should consider now what kind of a French
                        role we expect, what kind of relationship with the French we should desire,
                        and what kind of Atlantic Community we can have after <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s passing.</p>
                    <p>c. The Chinese are the biggest problem of all because of their size,
                        intransigence and isolation which, together, make the rest of our problems
                        seem academic. He emphasized that it should be the highest order of business
                        to achieve a study of our future policies on China as a follow-on to the
                        activities of this Committee.</p>
                    <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0203"/>
                    <p>d. In regard to Africa and Latin America, he felt we should quickly push for
                        denuclearization in order to achieve a 5-25 year breathing space.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>, in summation, pointed
                        to the problems of defining appropriate guarantees on a selective basis. Dr.
                        York stressed that such guarantees should be extremely limited, and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> emphasized that we
                        could give them only so long as the protected country remains non-nuclear.</p>
                    <p>There followed a review by members of the staff of problems of special
                        significance to them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KSMJ1">Keeny</persName> stressed that he believed
                        the net security advantage for the United States fell in “Model A,” which
                        course we could change to “Model B” if “Model A” fails. Dr. Rathjens and Mr.
                        Johnson emphasized the need for cooperation with the Soviet Union in future
                        efforts to stop proliferation. Mr. Rivkin pointed to the overall security
                        position of the Soviets in the face of possible Chinese and German nuclear
                        weapons capability, urging that the United States be prepared to negotiate
                        directly with the Soviets on their long-range security situation, and
                        suggesting that we consider denuclearized, guaranteed German re-unification
                        as an early alternative to the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GRL2">Garthoff</persName> expressed reservations
                        about the consequences of Course III, some of which he felt could be either
                        bad or disastrous. He indicated that if we give up the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> to achieve non-proliferation, we avoid
                        getting the British out of deterrence. He warned, with regard to dealing
                        with the Soviets, that we might be exchanging good relations with our allies
                        for an uncertain detente. He believed that Soviet participation is not
                        essential to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Any proposal to the Soviets
                        for halting strategic delivery vehicle deployment should not be allowed to
                        affect Polaris. In summary, he preferred Course II, “with liberal borrowing
                        from Course III and perhaps with Course I and Course IV.”</p>
                    <p>Professor <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> emphasized the need
                        for continuing studies. Existing policy, he said, is based on getting along
                        with our allies, regardless of the consequences. The problem of guarantees,
                        he thinks, has been over-emphasized, and little more is required than has
                        been given already. He desires a policy to make nuclear weapons appear bad
                        and the undertaking of progressive policies to eliminate United States
                        reliance on nuclear weapons. Reunification of Germany, he said, should be
                        clearly considered as an alternative to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> since it is the only policy which appears to resolve all our
                        needs. He felt that the Committee should recommend the study of orderly
                        controls on uranium exports and that it also consider the organization of
                        the vigorous mechanism within the government necessary to stop
                        proliferation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Kistiakowsky noted that arguments in favor of Plowshare are based on an
                        unsymmetrical assumption about technology in which <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0204"/>Plowshare improves and conventional
                        excavating technology stays the same. There was general agreement, in
                        conclusion, that our hopes to stop proliferation are based on two basic
                        “ifs”: Soviet cooperation and future Chinese behavior.</p>

                        the interest of your Government in first restraining and limiting the arms
                        race, and then decisively reversing it. I think that we can take some
                        satisfaction in the fact that both our Governments have been able, without
                        formal agreement, to reduce our military budgets by amounts which may be
                        small in relation to our total arms expenditure but are nevertheless of some
                        significance in that we have both succeeded in putting an end to the annual
                        increases in this heavy burden. I am able to tell you now that our budget
                        for the fiscal year 1965 will call for expenditures in our Department of
                        Defense of $47.9 billion, which is more than $2 billion less than was
                        requested in my budget submitted to the Congress in January 1964.</p>

                        further at this time, other than to say that I continue to believe deeply
                        that there would be advantage to us all in progress toward the specific
                        arrangements I have proposed. <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0205"/>In
                        particular, we are convinced that the interest of our two peoples, and
                        indeed of all mankind, would be advanced by steps beyond the limited test
                        ban treaty to prevent the dissemination of nuclear weapons. I am able to
                        confirm to you once again that it is this fundamental policy that underlies
                        all our actions in this field, including those about which your Government
                        has expressed concern, in the area of the nuclear defense of the members of
                        the North Atlantic Alliance. I remain convinced that if we work together
                        with the common purpose of opposing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we
                        should be able to eliminate misunderstandings between us and serve our
                        common interests.</p>
                    <p>I fully share your view that agreements reached between our Governments
                        should be honestly observed by both sides, and I can assure you of our good
                        faith on this score. Many of the problems which today plague the world, and
                        which in one way or another involve the Soviet Union and the United States,
                        are highly complex, both in their origins and in their ramifications. I am
                        hopeful, however, that with good will on both sides, a steady and consistent
                        effort to resolve them can succeed. We shall, of course, have to proceed
                        step by step, but every success will, in my opinion, make the remaining
                        problems easier to resolve. You may be sure that I am determined to
                        persevere on this path.</p>

                    <p>At 2 p.m. I attended the Meeting of Principals in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s Office in the Department of State.
                        Others present at the meeting included <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> (Chairman), <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Bundy, <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Llewellyn Thompson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>. The
                        purpose of the meeting was to discuss the venting of the January 15th Soviet
                        underground test. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> described
                        the evidence upon which the conclusion was based that venting had occurred.
                        The acoustic signals were somewhat anomalous, which is consistent with the
                        venting nature of the event, but makes the determination of the energy
                        vented into the atmosphere a little indeterminate. Substantial debris was
                        picked up over Japan, which together with the other evidence makes it clear
                        that it was a Soviet test that had vented. It was decided that there should
                        be a press release, accompanied by a background briefing for key press
                        people. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, and I had draft press releases
                        available, and these were used as the basis for drafting the press release
                            (attached),<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">Not printed. <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> press release, January 19; ibid., p.
                            74. It was also read to news correspondents by a Department of State
                            spokesman on January 25. (Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, February 8, 1965, p. 187)</note> which was agreed to by
                        the group.</p>
                    <p>I argued for the inclusion of the statement that this was not a violation of
                        the limited test ban treaty, but the others disagreed with this point of
                        view. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> was particularly strong
                        in his feeling that this was, in fact, a test ban violation, while the
                        others felt that it should not be so regarded, but they didn't feel it would
                        be wise to so state in the press release. There seemed to be general
                        agreement that the venting was accidental. There was some discussion of the
                        U.S. Kiwi-TNT test, in which <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
                        and I explained that this was definitely not a weapons test but a planned
                        excursion of a nuclear reactor.<note n="3" xml:id="d62fn3">Anticipating the

                    <p>At 3:15 p.m. I attended the Meeting with the President in the Cabinet Room of
                        the White House. Others present at the meeting included President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> and Bundy. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> began the meeting by saying that its
                        purpose was to discuss the venting of the Soviet nuclear underground test
                        that took place on January 15th. He and <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> described the evidence for this.</p>
                    <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0207"/>
                    <p>The detection of radioactive debris over Japan, at about the predicted time,
                        made it quite clear that it was a Soviet nuclear test that had vented.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested that, in view of
                        the fact that the Japanese would probably detect the radioactive debris soon
                        and would announce this fact, it seemed highly desirable for the U.S. to
                        make an announcement immediately. The proposed press release that had been
                        composed by the Principals in their meeting during the previous hour was
                        placed before the President. He read it and said he thought it was generally
                        all right, but perhaps a little obscure with its somewhat technical
                        language. Bundy explained the need for the particular phraseology used and
                        that much of it constituted words of art understood by the interested press
                        people. The President then agreed to the wording of the release and
                        authorized its issuance without change. It was agreed that it would be
                        issued for 6 p.m. release, and that there would be a background briefing of
                        the press at the State Department at which <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> and a

                        by me) would participate. (Kavanagh was chosen to play this role.)<note n="4" xml:id="d62fn4">Dr. George M. Kavanagh, Assistant General Manager

                    <p>It was also requested that <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> inform

                        The President then went on to complain about the leaks to the newspapers
                        that had occurred within the last few days. He was particularly direct and
                        vociferous in his complaints to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, as the leaks had involved their
                        departments. He reiterated that the leaks to newspapers must be stopped.</p>
                    <p>At 4 p.m. I talked with <persName corresp="#p_HC5">Holifield</persName>,

                            <persName corresp="#p_HC6">Hosmer</persName>'s office, and advised that
                        we have detected debris from the Russian test which, to us, means that it
                        vented. I said that the U.S. is going to announce this in a rather low key.
                        We are reasonably sure the Japanese have detected this, and we wish to
                        announce first.</p>

                    <p>On January 21, 1965, at 1 p.m., the <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> Committee met with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> to present its report on nuclear
                        proliferation.

                        Committee and the conclusions of the report. He also noted: “The committee
                        comes down hard on one side of this tough question [of proliferation], and
                        at least one of your advisers—Dean <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>—has real doubts about its recommendations. For that reason
                        there will be no public discussion of the report at present, and you
                        yourself will probably wish to reserve your position until the matter has
                        been studied by your own people.” (Johnson Library, National Security File,

                    <p rend="center">NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION</p>
                    <p>At your request, we have studied the problem of preventing the spread of
                        nuclear weapons. In our examination, we consulted widely with your principal
                        officers from relevant agencies of the Government. In the process, we
                        considered a range of possible policies for the future and their
                        consequences for the Nation. We have noted a significant diversity of views
                        within the Government about the feasibility and the costs of preventing
                        nuclear proliferation, and consequently about appropriate policies for the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>Among ourselves there was also a diversity of opinions at the outset of our
                        study. As a result of our study, however, the Committee is now unanimous in
                        its view that preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons is clearly in
                        the national interest despite the difficult decisions that will be required.
                        We have concluded, therefore, that the United States must, as a matter of
                        great urgency, substantially increase the scope and intensity of our efforts
                        if we are to have any hope of success. Necessarily, these efforts must be of
                        three kinds: (a) negotiation of formal multilateral agreements; (b) the
                        application of influence on individual nations considering nuclear weapons
                        acquisition, by ourselves and in conjunction with others; and (c) example by
                        our own policies and actions.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, we have concluded that:</p>
                    <p>1. The spread of nuclear weapons poses an increasingly grave threat to the
                        security of the United States. New nuclear capabilities, however primitive
                        and regardless of whether they are held by nations currently friendly to the
                        United States, will add complexity and instability to the deterrent balance
                        between the United States and the Soviet Union, aggravate suspicions and
                        hostility among states neighboring new nuclear powers, place a wasteful
                        economic burden on the aspirations of developing <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0210"/>nations, impede the vital task of controlling and reducing
                        weapons around the world, and eventually constitute direct military threats
                        to the United States.</p>
                    <p>As additional nations obtained nuclear weapons, our diplomatic and military
                        influence would wane, and strong pressures would arise to retreat to
                        isolation to avoid the risk of involvement in nuclear war. Nevertheless,
                        even then, we could not escape the problem. There would be additional
                        nuclear powers—perhaps some in this hemisphere—individually possessing the
                        capability of destroying millions of American lives. Major defensive efforts
                        might help substantially to diminish such limited threats, but millions of
                        American lives would always be at risk.</p>
                    <p>2. The world is fast approaching a point of no return in the prospects of
                        controlling the spread of nuclear weapons. Nuclear power programs are
                        placing within the hands of many nations much of the knowledge, equipment
                        and materials for making nuclear weapons. The recent Chinese Communist
                        nuclear explosion has reinforced the belief, increasingly prevalent
                        throughout the world, that nuclear weapons are a distinguishing mark of a
                        world leader, are essential to national security, and are feasible even with
                        modest industrial resources. The Chinese Communist nuclear weapons program
                        has brought particular pressure on India and Japan, which may both be
                        approaching decisions to undertake nuclear weapons programs.</p>
                    <p>Although one might be tempted to accept Indian or Japanese nuclear weapons to
                        counterbalance those of China, we do not believe the spread of nuclear
                        weapons would or could be stopped there. An Indian or Japanese decision to
                        build nuclear weapons would probably produce a chain reaction of similar
                        decisions by other countries, such as Pakistan, Israel and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. In these circumstances, it is unrealistic
                        to hope that Germany and other European countries would not decide to
                        develop their own nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>We are convinced, therefore, that energetic and comprehensive steps must be
                        taken in the near future to discourage further acquisition of nuclear
                        weapons capabilities or an accelerating increase in the number of nations
                        engaged in nuclear weapons programs will occur—possibly beginning within a
                        matter of months.</p>
                    <p>3. Success in preventing the future spread of nuclear weapons requires a
                        concerted and intensified effort. Although non-proliferation has been a
                        declared part of United States foreign policy since 1945, we must now
                        greatly intensify our efforts—both to obtain appropriate multilateral
                        agreements and to affect directly the motivations of individual nations—if
                        we are to have any hope of success in halting the spread of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>We have been impressed in the course of our study by the fact that actions
                        affecting the spread of nuclear weapons also relate to a very <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0211"/>broad range of United States interests:
                        relations with our allies and with other nations, weapons deployments at
                        home and abroad, programs in peaceful atomic energy, and commerce with
                        foreign nations. In order that our efforts to stop nuclear proliferation may
                        succeed, each of these areas of interest, as well as the agencies of
                        Government which deal with them, must be truly responsive to our
                        non-proliferation policies, and must give such non-proliferation policies
                        far greater weight and support than they have received in the past.</p>
                    <p>We must acknowledge the importance of participation by the Soviet Union in
                        efforts to stop proliferation. Furthermore, it is unlikely that others can
                        be induced to abstain indefinitely from acquiring nuclear weapons if the
                        Soviet Union and the United States continue in a nuclear arms race.
                        Therefore, lessened emphasis by the United States and the Soviet Union on
                        nuclear weapons, and agreements on broader arms control measures must be
                        recognized as important components in the overall program to prevent nuclear
                        proliferation.</p>
                    <p>4. A major effort on our part has promise of success in halting or retarding
                        the spread of nuclear weapons. The dangers of proliferation affect all
                        countries, creating a widespread common interest in early and effective
                        steps to halt the nuclear spread. To date, initiatives within the United
                        Nations and in disarmament negotiations have been only partially successful,
                        but the Irish Resolution of 1961 and the limited nuclear test ban treaty of
                        1963 continue to offer a basis on which to take more comprehensive and
                        effective steps. There remains broad support for multilateral measures to
                        control nuclear proliferation.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the Soviet Union, because of its growing vulnerability to
                        proliferation among its neighbors, probably shares with us a strong interest
                        in preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons. Further, we believe
                        that the change of leadership in the Soviet Union and the possible resulting
                        review of Soviet nuclear policies may now provide an immediate opportunity
                        for joint or parallel action in the near future to stop the nuclear spread.</p>
                    <p>Of course, even major efforts on our part may not be successful in halting or
                        greatly retarding the spread of nuclear weapons. But we are unanimous in our
                        agreement that such efforts should be made. The rewards of long-term success
                        would be enormous; and even partial success would be worth the costs we can
                        expect to incur.</p>
                    <p rend="center">RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
                    <p>We therefore recommend that the United States undertake the following
                        measures to implement its policy to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons:</p>
                    <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0212"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Multilateral agreements.</p>
                    <p>Measures to prevent particular countries from acquiring nuclear weapons are
                        unlikely to succeed unless they are taken in support of a broad
                        international prohibition applicable to many countries. We should seek to
                        obtain on a multilateral basis formal treaty commitments of three kinds:</p>
                    <p>a. Non-proliferation agreement. We should intensify our efforts for a
                        non-proliferation agreement and seek the early conclusion of the widest and
                        most effective possible international treaty on non-dissemination and
                        non-acquisition of nuclear weapons. We should be prepared to bring strong
                        pressure on significant countries (including Germany, France, India, Japan,
                        Israel, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Sweden) to achieve their
                        participation in such an agreement. Our initiatives in this area should not
                        wait, or be dependent upon, the resolution of any issues relating to an
                        Atlantic nuclear force, however helpful such resolution might be.</p>
                    <p>As recommended in paragraph 3 below, we should intensify our efforts to
                        persuade the Soviets of our strong non-dissemination objectives in
                        connection with any Atlantic Nuclear Force in order to make it possible for
                        the Soviets to take the lead with us in seeking worldwide support for a
                        non-proliferation treaty. In any event, any conflict between our
                        non-proliferation and <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> objectives may not
                        become critical until the future of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> is known; but if it
                        arises strongly before then, the priorities of the two proposals with
                        respect to our overall national security should be carefully reviewed.</p>
                    <p>b. Comprehensive test ban. We should renew our efforts to negotiate a
                        verified comprehensive test ban with the Soviet Union. Assuming there will
                        be an adequate withdrawal provision in the treaty, we should be prepared to
                        go ahead without the participation of either France or China. We should be
                        prepared to accept the minimum number of on-site inspections in the Soviet
                        Union that would be consistent with a viable treaty. In this connection, we
                        should consider our anticipated improved capabilities for seismic detection
                        and identification, and our other relevant unilateral intelligence
                        capabilities. Inspection procedures and quotas covering other countries
                        should also be reviewed to facilitate the widest and most effective
                        application of the treaty. We should be prepared to propose an exception to
                        such a treaty for peaceful nuclear explosions if a satisfactory procedure
                        can be promptly devised that would preclude the development of nuclear
                        weapons under the guise of a peaceful explosives program and if such an
                        exception would be acceptable to other nations. An early approach should be
                        made to the Soviet Union, and we should seek the widest adherence to the
                        agreement and be prepared to bring strong influence to bear on significant
                        countries to participate in it.</p>
                    <p>c. Nuclear free zones. We should actively support the establishment of Latin
                        American and African (including, if possible, Israel-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>) nuclear <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0213"/>free
                        zones. To facilitate such agreements, we should be prepared to modify our
                        requirements for verification and our position on transit rights and
                        declarations with respect to United States nuclear weapons to the maximum
                        extent consistent with demonstrable United States security needs.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Policies toward non-nuclear powers.</p>
                    <p>In conjunction with the multilateral measures described above, we should
                        intensify our efforts on a country-by-country basis to influence the
                        decisions of individual non-nuclear powers not to undertake the development
                        or acquisition of nuclear weapons and to secure workable commitments to this
                        effect. We should ourselves refrain from actions that would contribute to or
                        suggest a future contribution to the development of nuclear weapons by these
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>The State, Treasury and Commerce Departments should develop programs of
                        economic restrictions and other measures which could be quickly imposed by
                        Executive action and which would be strong enough to produce a reversal of
                        any decision to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>a. India—to deter India from building nuclear weapons:</p>
                    <p>(1) While attempting, if possible, to avoid formal guarantees, we should be
                        prepared, to the extent necessary and if requested by the Indians, to offer
                        credible assurance of United States action in the event of a nuclear attack
                        on India in exchange for an Indian commitment not to acquire nuclear
                        weapons. We should be prepared to undertake, if requested by the Indians,
                        parallel action with the Soviets and/or the United Kingdom. Appropriate
                        agencies of the Government should give early consideration to the form such
                        United States assurances might take.</p>
                    <p>(2) We should assist India in reasonable and economically justifiable
                        scientific programs designed to build the prestige she might otherwise
                        attempt to obtain from the development of a nuclear device. Such programs
                        should be of a character that will not contribute significantly to future
                        nuclear weapons capabilities. Particular attention should be given to those
                        areas (such as natural resources, health and birth control) most relevant to
                        India's economic and social problems. We might also initiate a major
                        coordinated United States-Indian program of scientific, cultural and
                        educational exchanges. In consultation with appropriate agencies, your
                        Science Advisory Committee should be called upon to submit recommendations
                        regarding United States assistance to Indian scientific activities and
                        United States-Indian exchanges.</p>
                    <p>(3) We should back India for a larger role in the United Nations. Such
                        support, and, to the extent feasible, any new role, should be conditional on
                        India's remaining a non-nuclear power.</p>
                    <p>(4) We should reconsider the level of our economic and military assistance to
                        India in the event she decides to develop or otherwise acquire nuclear
                        weapons. To the extent that advance knowledge of this intention by Indian
                        officials would be likely to have a constructive influence, it should be
                        disclosed to them.</p>
                    <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0214"/>
                    <p>b. Japan—to deter Japan from building nuclear weapons:</p>
                    <p>(1) We should reaffirm, and if necessary, reinforce our present defense
                        commitment. As in the case of India, early consideration should be given to
                        the form these commitments might take.</p>
                    <p>(2) We should, as in the case of India, attempt to help the Japanese with
                        appropriate prestige alternatives.</p>
                    <p>(3) We should support Japan's desire for a more important role as a world
                        leader.</p>
                    <p>c. Israel-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>(1) Israel. As long as Israel remains a non-nuclear power, we should continue
                        to give Israel assurances against being overrun by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. We should make clear to Israel that these
                        assurances would be withdrawn if she develops a nuclear weapon capability
                        and that we would be prepared to consider other measures as well.</p>
                    <p>(2) <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. We should make it clear to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> that our policy restraining an independent
                        Israeli nuclear force is unlikely to be effective if the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> acquires nuclear weapons. If the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> should make a decision to do so, we should
                        be prepared to take measures designed to reverse that decision.</p>
                    <p>(3) We should make major efforts to persuade France, Germany or others
                        against providing missile or nuclear assistance to Israel or the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, and should work for Soviet cooperation in
                        keeping the Israeli-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> confrontation
                        non-nuclear.</p>
                    <p>d. Spread of weapons technology. We should revise and broaden <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294 so that it will restrict United
                        States contributions to the development of nuclear warheads or strategic
                        nuclear delivery capabilities of any country (including the United Kingdom
                        if she can be induced to fold her strategic nuclear force into the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>). Moreover, we should seek to enlist the
                        cooperation of other advanced nations in parallel actions designed to
                        complement the actions of the United States.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Policies toward Europe and the Atlantic Nuclear
                        Force.</p>
                    <p>Our present policies in this area are defined in <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 322. In dealing with the Soviet Union, it should be made
                        clear that any Atlantic Nuclear Force must reinforce and contribute to our
                        basic policy of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. To this end, it should
                        be emphasized that any treaty establishing such a Force would include
                        undertakings whereby the nuclear members would agree not to disseminate
                        nuclear weapons to the independent control of non-nuclear members and the
                        non-nuclear members would undertake not to develop or acquire or obtain
                        control over nuclear weapons; that in all cases the agreement of the United
                        States would be required in order to have the Force fire nuclear weapons;
                        and that the voting procedures could be revised only with the unanimous
                        agreement of all participating nations. Moreover, it should be emphasized
                        that any <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> agreement would prevent the
                        proliferation of individual nuclear capabilities among the participants and
                        may reduce the <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0215"/>number of nations
                        having independent strategic nuclear capabilities by at least one (the
                        United Kingdom).</p>
                    <p>Several of the members of the Committee believe that an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> or
                        something like it may be essential if the Germans are to be inhibited from
                        eventually acquiring an independent nuclear capability. Others feel that
                        more modest measures such as increased sharing in nuclear consultation and
                        planning and further exploitation of bilateral arrangements for nuclear
                        weapons systems would suffice to deter the Germans from an independent
                        nuclear course, particularly since the Germans are aware that such a course
                        would be strongly opposed by France and the Soviet Union. In addition, it
                        could be made clear to the Germans that the maintenance of United States
                        forces in Germany would be inconsistent with the independent possession of
                        nuclear weapons by Germany. Others of the Committee, seeing a basic
                        incompatibility between the goal of German reunification and German
                        acquisition of nuclear weapons, feel that greater emphasis should be placed
                        on reunification as a means of shifting German interests away from nuclear
                        weapons toward an objective more consistent with long-term European
                        stability.</p>
                    <p>In any case, all members agree that the appropriate agencies of the
                        Government should continue urgent exploration of possible alternatives to an
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>
                        which would permanently inhibit Germany from acquiring nuclear weapons, but
                        would nevertheless assure that, in the absence of German reunification, West
                        Germany would remain as a real ally on the Western side.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Policies toward existing nuclear powers.</p>
                    <p>a. France. While maintaining a place for France in the structure of any
                            <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>, as provided in <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 322, we should make it clear to France
                        that her insistence upon the development of an independent nuclear-strategic
                        capability and upon atmospheric testing are unacceptable. Accordingly:</p>
                    <p>(1) We should in no way assist the French atmospheric or underground nuclear
                        test program and should be prepared to support international measures
                        initiated by others having the effect of impeding or penalizing French
                        nuclear tests.</p>
                    <p>(2) Insofar as France is concerned, we should interpret <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294 strictly.</p>
                    <p>b. United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>(1) We should continue to favor the incorporation of the United Kingdom
                        independent strategic nuclear deterrent in an <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>-type arrangement.</p>
                    <p>(2) In consultation with the United Kingdom, we should undertake an
                        appropriate revision of the 1958 amendment of the Atomic Energy Act
                        authorizing nuclear assistance to nations with advanced weapons capabilities
                        that would be consistent with the future course of a special relationship
                        with the United Kingdom while removing the implicit <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0216"/>encouragement of existing law to other
                        countries to achieve advanced nuclear capabilities.</p>
                    <p>c. Soviet Union. In view of the great importance of Soviet support and
                        cooperation in connection with efforts to stop nuclear proliferation, we
                        should undertake new initiatives to obtain such support. We should make
                        early approaches to the Soviets, seeking cooperation on as broad a basis as
                        possible in achieving the objectives described in this report, and to the
                        extent possible, the relevant specific actions set forth in paragraphs 1, 2
                        and 5 of these recommendations.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the direct non-proliferation measures described in paragraph 1
                        above, we should undertake early initiatives toward the following United
                        States-Soviet arms control agreements as a means both of reducing tensions
                        between the United States and the Soviet Union and creating an atmosphere
                        conducive to wide acceptance of restraints on nuclear proliferation:</p>
                    <p>(1) A verified fissile materials production cutoff for weapons purposes, to
                        be established by treaty (with appropriate provision permitting the
                        production of tritium).</p>
                    <p>(2) A verified strategic delivery vehicle freeze coupled with significant
                        agreed reductions (e.g. 30%) in strategic force levels, to be established by
                        treaty.</p>
                    <p>(3) An 18- to 24-month halt in the construction of new <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        launchers, to be accomplished by reciprocal Executive action based on
                        unilateral verification capabilities.</p>
                    <p>d. China. We believe that it will prove difficult over the long term either
                        to halt nuclear proliferation or to obtain worldwide peace and stability
                        until China has joined the society of nations and is willing to participate
                        responsibly in arms control measures. In view of the complexity and
                        difficulty of the problem, we recommend that the Government undertake a
                        major high-level reexamination of our policies toward China, taking into
                        account the effect of those policies upon all aspects of our national
                        security and our alliances in the Far East.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Peaceful uses of atomic energy.</p>
                    <p>While we recognize that in the long run fissionable materials will probably
                        be available in all industrial countries as a result of nuclear power
                        programs, we believe that every effort should be made at this time to ensure
                        that peaceful atomic energy programs do not unreasonably contribute to
                        potential proliferation of nuclear weapons capabilities. We should in all
                        cases insist on adequate safeguards for all peaceful programs. Moreover, our
                        support should be limited to those programs which will advance the economic
                        development of friendly countries; and we should not press such programs
                        with special subsidies. Careful consideration should be given to the
                        political stability and reliability of countries where such programs are
                        undertaken. We should make an <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0217"/>effort to get all potential suppliers to agree to offer materials and
                        facilities only under adequate safeguards.</p>
                    <p>We should take the following actions with regard to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and Euratom:</p>
                    <p>a. <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>(1) We should increase our efforts to build up the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>, including broader responsibilities, increased operational
                        activities, larger budgets and improved technical capabilities.</p>
                    <p>(2) We should exert stronger influence on all nations including supplying
                        nations and the Soviet Bloc to accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards on reactors and separation plants and should offer, in return, to
                        extend safeguards to additional United States facilities.</p>
                    <p>(3) We should explore additional means of establishing control practices with
                        respect to uranium and fuel elements which would reduce the risk of nuclear
                        power facilities being used for military purposes.</p>
                    <p>b. Euratom.</p>
                    <p>(1) We should press Euratom in order to obtain satisfactory United States
                        verification of Euratom safeguards.</p>
                    <p>(2) We should work toward Euratom acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards and <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        acceptance of Euratom.</p>
                    <p>While we recognize that the peaceful uses of nuclear explosives (Project
                        Plowshare) may have long-term economic importance, we do not believe that
                        the program should be allowed to jeopardize a comprehensive test ban treaty
                        or to encourage interest in nuclear weapons. Undue emphasis on such programs
                        tends to make nuclear explosives appear desirable, necessary and acceptable
                        for countries presently considering undertaking nuclear weapons programs. In
                        addition, attempts to incorporate provisions permitting such programs under
                        a comprehensive test ban treaty may be difficult, if not impossible, without
                        providing a loophole under which nuclear weapons could be developed. We
                        should not, therefore, actively seek to interest other countries in such
                        programs until we better understand their relationship to the comprehensive
                        test ban and the general nuclear proliferation problem.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. United States weapons policies.</p>
                    <p>If we are to minimize the incentives for others to acquire nuclear weapons,
                        it is important that we avoid giving an exaggerated impression of their
                        importance and utility and that we stress the current and future important
                        role of conventional armaments. It is also important that our physical
                        arrangements minimize the possibility of unauthorized seizure or compromise
                        of design information regarding United States nuclear weapons deployed
                        abroad. Accordingly, we should take the following actions:</p>
                    <p>a. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategy. We believe that the
                        prospects for success of our effort to stop the spread of nuclear weapons
                        will be enhanced by adoption <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0218"/>of a
                        revised <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategy, along the lines now
                        being proposed by the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
                        placing greater stress on a non-nuclear option and relying less upon
                        tactical nuclear weapons. (Such a policy would of course maintain a tactical
                        nuclear capability for deterrence, credibility and flexibility.)</p>
                    <p>b. Physical security. The program for the installation of Permissive Action
                        Links (PALs) in weapons deployed in Europe should be continued and expanded
                        to apply to all weapons deployed overseas. Intensified research to develop
                        improved safeguards against seizure or unauthorized use should be continued.
                        We should consider appropriate assistance to the United Kingdom, France and
                        the Soviet Union in connection with the development of PALs and safety
                        devices for their respective weapons.</p>
                    <p>c. Research and development. The Department of Defense should reexamine
                        future requirements in the light of the policies recommended in this
                        memorandum. Consideration should be given, among other matters, to damage
                        limitation systems effective against lesser nuclear threats; to detection
                        and identification systems related to such threats; and to the development
                        of any weapons systems necessary to back our commitments to nations electing
                        not to develop their own nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>The program outlined above should not preclude other measures to prevent
                        nuclear proliferation and the appropriate agencies of the Government should
                        be called upon to undertake to develop additional proposals to that end. All
                        agencies should carefully consider the implications for nuclear
                        proliferation of all their actions and information policies, and their
                        progress on non-proliferation matters should, we think, be followed closely
                        by you and your senior advisers.</p>

                    <p>No. 3</p>
                    <p>According to Associated Press Agency reports, a nuclear rocket engine of the
                        “Kiwi” type, which is a prototype of engines for space ships, was exploded
                        for experimental purposes on January 12 of this year in the U.S.A. The
                        purpose of this experiment, as the Agency points out, was to establish what
                        might occur in case of an accident during the launching of a rocket with
                        nuclear fuel. As an Associated Press correspondent reports, there occurred
                        as a result of the explosion “a tremendous cloud of dust and a flash of
                        light which blocked the sun” for some time. Judging by the report of this
                        Agency, published prior to the experiment, the self-generating explosion of
                        the nuclear rocket engine must have been accompanied by the dissemination of
                        radioactive particles from the explosion over a large distance.</p>
                    <p>In connection with this the Soviet Government cannot but come to the
                        conclusion that if these reports of the Associated Press Agency about the
                        nuclear explosion which has been conducted conform to reality, then there
                        has taken place a violation by the United States of the “Treaty Banning
                        Nuclear Weapons Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Underwater,”
                        signed in Moscow on August 5, 1963, and which entered into force October 10
                        of that year. As is known, in point 1, Article I, of the cited treaty it is
                        stated that each of its participants “undertakes to prohibit, to prevent,
                        and not to carry out any nuclear weapon test explosion, or any other nuclear
                        explosion, at any place under its jurisdiction or control,” in the
                        atmosphere, in outer space and underwater.</p>
                    <p>Considering the full seriousness of the situation which can arise in the case
                        that there really took place a nuclear explosion falling under the
                        prohibition stipulated by the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons
                        tests, the Soviet Government expects that the Government of the U.S.A. will
                        give the necessary clarifications regarding the character of the experiment
                        carried out in the U.S.A. on January 12 of this year.</p>

                        out deep down underground. The quantity of radioactive debris that leaked
                        into the atmosphere was, however, so insignificant that a possibility of its
                        fallout outside the territorial limits of the Soviet Union should be
                        excluded. Thus, the underground explosion that was carried out does not

                    <p>“I handed the Ambassador our reply to their aide-mémoire on the Kiwi reactor.
                        After reading it, the Ambassador quoted from the language of the Treaty,
                        stating that in addition to weapons tests, 'any other nuclear explosion
                        anywhere which would take place in any of the environments described' was
                        prohibited. He stated that this experiment had been described by the
                        American press as a nuclear explosion. I said that although the matter was a
                        technical one, my understanding was that the operation of any nuclear
                        reactor could, in one sense of the word, be described as a nuclear
                        explosion. My understanding was that in this case in order to develop
                        reactor safety, a reactor was speeded up to the point where it burned itself
                        up, but that this was not comparable to what we would consider a nuclear
                        explosion by a very wide margin.</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he would of course
                        transmit our aide-mémoire and that it would be studied in Moscow, but he
                        clearly indicated that he did not consider we had made a convincing case.”

                    <p>The aide-mémoire from the Soviet Government, dated January 22,<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2">
                            <ref target="#d65">Document 65</ref>.</note> requests that the
                        Government of the United States provide clarification <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0221"/>regarding the Kiwi reactor safety
                        experiment as to whether it constituted a nuclear explosion falling under
                        the prohibition stipulated by the “Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapons Tests in
                        the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water.” Reactors are designed as
                        stable power sources and are intrinsically unsuitable for use as weapons.
                        Neither reactor safety experiments nor reactor accidents which they are
                        designed to stimulate or reproduce constitute nuclear explosions. Therefore,
                        they do not fall under the prohibition stipulated in the Treaty.
                        Nevertheless, in view of the interest of the Soviet Government, the
                        Government of the United States provides the following information
                        concerning this experiment.</p>
                    <p>The Kiwi experiment of January 12, 1965, at the Nuclear Rocket Development
                        Station in Nevada, was the latest of the series of reactor safety
                        experiments to obtain information to ensure the safe operation of nuclear
                        reactors and to assess the potential consequences in the unlikely event that
                        a reactor accident occurred. Reactor safety experiments have been freely
                        discussed at the Third International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of
                        Atomic Energy<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3">Regarding this conference, held in

                        reactor safety experiments including those involving reactor destruction,
                        such as the Spert test conducted during November 1963, and the Snaptran test
                        in April 1964, have been reported in the open literature. The same procedure
                        is being followed for this experiment. The experiment was announced publicly
                        in advance and the press was present.</p>
                    <p>The Kiwi reactor safety experiment involved a deliberate burn-up of a nuclear
                        rocket reactor designed for space exploration. This experiment was necessary
                        to obtain data on the behavior of reactors of this type under rapid changes
                        in power levels. Extensive safety studies have been performed to determine
                        the effects of various postulated accident conditions which might
                        theoretically cause such rapid changes in power levels. This experiment was
                        conducted to confirm or correct the predictions of those safety studies.</p>
                    <p>The Kiwi reactor is a uranium carbide fueled, graphite moderated reactor of
                        approximately 1,000 megawatts thermal power. The experiment was conducted as
                        planned and produced a relatively small amount of energy over a time period
                        thousands of times longer than the period involved in nuclear explosions.
                        Specifically, according to preliminary data, a total energy of about 15,000
                        megawatt-seconds was produced over several milliseconds. This release of
                        energy caused portions of the reactor to vaporize and the reactor to destroy
                        itself.</p>
                    <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0222"/>
                    <p>Results were in good agreement with pre-test predictions. The experiment
                        therefore lends confidence to the reactor safety studies which are so
                        important in the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.</p>

                            <ref target="#d61">Document 61</ref>.</note> has been attentively
                        studied by us. On that same confidential basis we should like to inform you
                        of the point of view of the Soviet Government both regarding the questions
                        raised by you and also regarding several other international questions.</p>
                    <p>We received with satisfaction the response, which we found in your message,
                        to the ideas of the Soviet Government, which were transmitted to you on
                        November 3, 1964<note n="3" xml:id="d68fn3">See <ref target="#d61fn3">footnote 3, Document 61</ref>.</note>, regarding the necessity to
                        resolve ripened problems by means of discussions and regarding the
                        importance of honorable observance by both sides of agreements already
                        reached between our governments.</p>
                    <p>We agree with the statement contained in your message that measures to
                        prevent the dissemination of nuclear weapons would answer the interests of
                        our two peoples and all of humanity. In this connection, it goes without
                        saying that there should not be left a single chink (for access) to them by
                        states not now possessing such weapons—direct or indirect. However, what is
                        now happening in the West is, unfortunately, going in the opposite
                        direction.</p>
                    <p>You know what a negative attitude is called forth in the Soviet Union and in
                        countries who are our friends and allies by plans to establish <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear forces in any of their
                        variations—“multilateral” or “<pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0223"/>Atlantic.” These plans likewise are plans to disseminate nuclear weapons,
                        and in the most dangerous region of the world. Giving Western Germany access
                        to nuclear weapons, in whatever form it might be planned, we cannot regard
                        as other than a step directed against the interests of the security of the
                        Soviet Union and of the countries united in the Warsaw Pact organization, as
                        a step strengthening the threat of war.</p>
                    <p>We know that you have a different point of view. You say that between the
                        Governments of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> there exists a “misunderstanding” in this
                        regard. In our view the case is much more complicated. The Soviet people has
                        its own experience—an experience costing millions of lives—with the
                        treachery and aggression of the German militarists, whose well-known
                        pretensions, as is widely recognized even in the West, mainly stimulate the
                        development of plans for the dissemination of nuclear weapons, for example
                        under the flag of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear forces.</p>
                    <p>We should like with all frankness to tell you of our serious concern that in
                        several regions of the world and first of all in Southeast Asia there
                        continue to take place cases of breaking international agreements and even
                        military actions against the democratic republic of Vietnam. Such actions
                        cannot fail to call forth a corresponding answering reaction among us and
                        among our friends and allies. We are convinced that realism in policy
                        demands elimination of the dangerous tension which has arisen in Southeast
                        Asia especially in Vietnam and Laos, and that the way out lies in unbending
                        observance of the principle of respect for the sovereign rights of peoples
                        and for valid international agreements.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government considers that at the present moment it would be
                        appropriate to separate out from the group of problems which were the
                        subject of an exchange of opinions between the Governments of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> those problems with regard to which it would be possible to
                        reach an understanding. We have been successful in reaching an understanding
                        without formal agreement, for example, on the question of reducing military
                        budgets. In your message you state that the Government of the USA intends to
                        reduce somewhat military expenditures for the 1965 fiscal year, as we have
                        also done with regard to the Soviet budget. Our views both with regard to
                        the usefulness of this measure as well as with regard to its limited
                        significance, obviously coincide.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government takes as a point of departure the fact that it is now
                        important to develop such concrete and realistic measures as would narrow
                        the scope of the arms race and would lay a path toward the resolution of the
                        basic questions of disarmament, toward general and complete disarmament.
                        Soviet proposals, which in our opinion serve this goal, were presented for
                        the consideration of the XIX Session of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>

                    <p>Following the U.S. announcement of the venting of radioactive debris into the

                                vented<note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2">Regarding discussions leading to

                    <p>1. As you know, we picked up radioactive debris from a Soviet test that
                        vented on January 15, 1965. We reported this fact to the Soviet Union and
                        asked for an explanation.</p>
                    <p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> came back with
                        an oral statement in which the Soviet Government agreed that there had been
                        venting, but denied the possibility of fallout outside the limits of the
                        Soviet Union. Meanwhile, we got pictures of the crater, and we have been
                        refining our analysis of the Soviet test. It is now reasonably certain that
                        the test was intended as a Plowshare excavation experiment. The explosion
                        was very <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0226"/>clean, with a yield of 300
                        to 400 kilotons. We believe that the venting was not accidental but was
                        inherent in the cratering design of the experiment. On the other hand, the
                        weather conditions at the time may well have led the Soviets to believe that
                        there would be no fallout beyond the borders of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>3. The test clearly raises a question of its legitimacy under the test ban
                        treaty, and we face something of a dilemma. On the one hand, if we do not
                        keep pressing the Soviets for a fuller explanation, we may seem to be giving
                        our tacit approval to a violation. On the other hand, if we take a
                        prosecutor's attitude we may only succeed in pinning ourselves to a position
                        of rigidity, on very small amounts of venting, that will work against our
                        own interest at some later stage when we may wish to make similar tests of
                        very clean devices of our own.</p>
                    <p>4. The conclusion that we have reached is that we should register our
                        dissatisfaction with the existing Soviet position and ask for more
                        information. This will protect us from seeming to accept an explanation that
                        is simply not in accordance with the facts, while at the same time we avoid
                        the position of a prosecutor under the treaty. Moreover, if by any chance
                        the Soviets do provide additional information, it will help to strengthen
                        the precedents for full disclosure of the facts surrounding any cases of
                        venting in the future.</p>

                    <p>THE SOVIET UNDERGROUND TEST OF JANUARY 15, 1965<note n="5" xml:id="d70fn5">This aide-mémoire has not been found, but was later referred to as
                            dated February 15. See <ref target="#d76fn7">footnote 7, Document
                            76</ref>. U.S.-Soviet discussions on this Soviet test apparently
                            continued, for <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> later
                            recounted: “On November 19, 1965, the State Department announced, 'on
                            the basis of discussions with the Soviet Government,' that the venting
                            from the Soviet test had been a result of 'miscalculation' and that the
                            United States had asked the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> 'to
                            take precautions to assure observance of the limited test ban treaty.'”

                    <p>The United States Government has studied Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s oral statement of January 25
                        together with all other presently available <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0227"/>data on the Soviet Union underground explosion of January
                        15, 1965 in the light of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the
                        Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water.</p>
                    <p>The United States has noted the observation contained in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s oral statement that the quantity
                        of radioactive debris that was placed in the atmosphere was “so
                        insignificant that a possibility of its fall out outside the territorial
                        limits of the Soviet Union is excluded.” However, we are unable to reconcile
                        the scientific findings with respect to the radioactive debris resulting
                        from the Soviet Union's test with the observations in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s oral statement.</p>
                    <p>On January 19, 20, 21 and 22 radioactive debris, which can be associated
                        directly with the Soviet nuclear explosion on January 15, was collected
                        outside the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. U.S. aircraft operating
                        in the Sea of Japan acquired fresh fission fragments traceable to the Soviet
                        test. In addition, the Radioactivity Countermeasures Headquarters of the
                        Government of Japan has published data collected from many ground stations
                        on January 20, 21 and 22 indicating concentrations of radioactive debris
                        which were as much as 10 to 100 times the levels on previous days.</p>
                    <p>Article I (b) of the Treaty imposes an obligation on parties to prohibit,
                        prevent and not to carry out any nuclear explosion in any environment
                        including underground, “if such explosion causes radioactive debris to be
                        present outside the territorial limits” of the party conducting the test.</p>
                    <p>In view of the foregoing, the Government of the United States requests
                        further information concerning this event.</p>

                        Disarmament</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The attached draft message on disarmament has been circulated by Bill Foster
                        to the Committee of Principals with the suggestion that it be<pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0228"/> discussed in the near future at a meeting
                        of the Committee of Principals.<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2">Not found.</note>
                        While I believe the attached draft is, in general, pretty good, I think that
                        it is clear that the next pen-pal message should cover a number of current
                        issues in addition to arms control. I hope that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> will draw on this <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> draft in the message he is
                            preparing.<note n="3" xml:id="d71fn3">No record has been found that a
                            message was sent at this time.</note> I am afraid he may not, however,
                        since the word I get from both <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> and
                        Dave Klein is that <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> does not
                        consider this entire subject as a “starter.” For my own part, I am not
                        prepared to rule out entirely the possibility that we might in the
                        relatively near term reach some sort of an agreement with the Soviets on
                        some modest arms control proposal such as a non-proliferation treaty. Even
                        if one discounts this possibility entirely, I believe that it is still
                        important to restate and develop our ideas on arms control as part of the
                        background mood music for a continuing dialogue with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> draft calls for exploration of
                        essentially all of the proposals currently being considered within
                        government that appear to have any chance of being cleared by the Principals
                        and negotiable with the Soviets. While I believe we should refer to specific
                        arms control areas in the next pen-pal message, I don't think we need throw
                        in everything we have at this time. Actually, I believe that <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> made their package this comprehensive to
                        increase the probability that something would survive. The <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> draft also names <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> as our negotiator to explore the
                        problems with the Soviets. While I have no objection to <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> doing the job, I wonder if naming
                        him specifically is a wise tactic at this time since it invites a Soviet
                        reply that he should deal with his opposite number, Tsarapkin, (an old-line
                        bureaucrat who, I doubt, is very close to the top of the Soviet Government)
                        rather than opening up the relatively high-level discussion which I believe
                        it called for.</p>
                    <p>In considering the priority of the items in the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> package, I agree with <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                        that the most important is an agreement to prevent the spread of nuclear
                        weapons. With regard to the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> has suggested some very cautious language
                        that is calculated not to upset the State Department; however, I am afraid
                        that it will not prove sufficiently reassuring to the Soviets to be of much
                        value. I have, therefore, suggested an alternate, more controversial, text
                        that I believe expresses our actual intentions in this matter.<note n="4" xml:id="d71fn4">Not further identified.</note> In this connection,
                            <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> suggests that we explore the
                        possibility of joint reassurances to nations that forego the acquisition of
                        nuclear weapons. I like the idea, but I do not think we should open this up
                        until we have further clarified our own thinking and <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0229"/>have explored the question further with the
                        Indians who are, of course, the principal nation concerned at the moment.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the next priority should be to reaffirm our interest in a
                        safeguarded comprehensive test ban. The Soviets seem to be putting out the
                        word that we are no longer interested in such an agreement and we must not
                        let them convince themselves that this is the case. I believe we should also
                        reassert our desire to discontinue the production of fissionable material
                        for weapons, and I agree with <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> that we
                        should use this opportunity to press the Soviets for a clarification of the
                        steps the Soviets have actually taken to carry out <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s announcement of cutbacks last
                            spring.<note n="5" xml:id="d71fn5">See <ref target="#d24">Document
                            24</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I think it is also important that we set forth at least one or two new ideas.
                        I believe the best candidates are the proposal to couple reductions of
                        agreed numbers of strategic missiles and launching sites to our strategic
                        freeze proposal and the proposal for a two-year moratorium on the
                        construction of new land-based facilities for strategic missiles and for
                        anti-ballistic missiles. These are substantive matters that would, of
                        course, require clearance with the Pentagon. They have, however, been
                        previously staffed and I understand that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> will support a proposal to explore them. I place a
                        lower priority on, but do not object to, the proposal to explore
                        arrangements to include the destruction of the non-nuclear components of
                        agreed numbers of nuclear weapons in conjunction with the transfer of
                        fissionable materials to peaceful purposes. This idea, which has been worked
                        out in some detail by <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>, is an
                        interesting response to Soviet charges that our transfer proposals don't
                        really affect nuclear weapons; however, I don't really believe the Soviets
                        will be very attracted by the proposal at this time. Similarly, while I
                        strongly support the concept of nuclear free zones and do not object to
                        discussing it with the Soviets, this is not the critical forum since we have
                        correctly taken the position that the initiative for nuclear free zones must
                        come from the areas involved.</p>
                    <p>I have placed the lowest priority on proposals to explore informal restraints
                        on the proliferation of strategic nuclear vehicles and the proposal to
                        consider reductions in launch facilities and associated strategic vehicles
                        prior to working out a strategic production freeze. I have not thought these
                        proposals through very carefully yet and have some questions about them.
                        Moreover, I think there would be considerable difficulty clearing these two
                        concepts quickly.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I do not believe that we should include ground observation posts in
                        Europe and the associated question of possible reductions in force levels.
                        While it is true that we have previously proposed observation <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0230"/>posts to guard against surprise attack, I
                        am afraid that this creates more political problems in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> than it is worth. In any event, the
                        suggestion that we explore reductions in force levels seems unwise at this
                        time.</p>
                    <p>I have indicated a number of detailed editorial changes on the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> draft, but have not attempted to rewrite
                        the draft in accordance with the above comments.</p>

                    <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> said that
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in his talks in London
                        last week had refused to include in the communique any mention of <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0231"/>resumed disarmament discussions at
                            Geneva.<note n="2" xml:id="d72fn2">Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Andrei A. Gromyko</persName>, who visited London
                            March 16-20, 1965, for talks with British Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Michael Stewart</persName>, did not mention
                            resumption of the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee, which had
                            adjourned in Geneva on September 17, 1964.</note> Nevertheless, he had
                        indicated that the Soviet reply to the US proposal regarding resumption of
                        the talks would be forthcoming shortly. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> listed three subjects which he had discussed with
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>: (1) a non-dissemination
                        agreement; (2) extension of the test ban to cover underground tests; and (3)
                        a combination of a freeze on delivery systems with the destruction of some
                        means of delivery. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had been
                        emphatic that so long as there is a prospect of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> or an <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> there can be no
                        agreement on non-dissemination. With respect to an extension of the test ban
                        to include underground tests, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        maintained that there is no need for on-site inspections. He did not respond
                        to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName>'s suggestion that
                        scientists on each site should examine the scientific basis for the Soviet
                        contention that on-site inspections are unnecessary.</p>
                    <p>In response to the Secretary's question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had not made any suggestions regarding a reconstitution
                        of the membership of the Geneva Conference, for example, to include
                        Communist China. In discussing other forums for disarmament negotiations,
                        however, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had referred to the
                        possibility of a five-power meeting, including Communist China, to discuss
                        nuclear weapons. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> believes
                        that the Soviet Union will probably agree to resume discussions at Geneva
                        but in doing so is likely to attach various restrictive conditions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the U.S. does not exclude the possibility of Chinese
                        Communist participation in disarmament negotiations. We have always
                        recognized that at a certain stage their participation will be necessary.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Secretary reported that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in discussing a possible budgetary approach to
                        disarmament had been unresponsive when the problem of differences in
                        budgetary accounting between different countries was raised with him. The
                        Secretary said that we would be interested in a budgetary approach to the
                        problem of disarmament but a necessary preliminary would be a discussion of
                        the comparability of budgets. We have informed the Soviet Union of
                        reductions in our defense budgets pursuant to the idea of encouraging
                        reductions by mutual example.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said that some parts of the
                        U.K. draft agreement on nonproliferation caused us concern. He mentioned in
                        this connection implications with respect to <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> with which we did not
                        agree. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> also expressed
                        doubts about the desirability of early tabling of <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0232"/>such a proposal in disarmament discussions.
                        He emphasized that we are in accord with the importance of a
                        non-dissemination agreement and the urgency of the matter.</p>
                    <p>With respect to an extension of the test ban treaty to cover underground
                        tests, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said that for
                        scientific and political reasons there is still a need for on-site
                        inspections. He recalled that our last offer had been for a minimum of seven
                        on-site inspections while the Russians had proposed three and then later had
                        withdrawn their offer. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>
                        expressed doubt about the desirability of our proposing a new number of
                        on-site inspections until the Soviet Union has accepted the principle of
                        such inspections. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> agreed
                        with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> on this point.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Secretary, reverting to the recent <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>/German talks,<note n="3" xml:id="d72fn3">Probably a reference to
                            West German Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Gerhard

                            nuclear issue.</note> said that the Federal Republic is not prepared to
                        consider any form of discrimination going beyond its present undertaking not
                        to manufacture nuclear weapons. The Germans are unwillling to enter into new
                        contractual obligations with the Soviet Union without concurrent progress on
                        reunification. The Secretary said we do not agree that this is a card the
                        Germans are entitled to play. If we reach agreement on an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> we can,
                        however, say the German reunification would necessitate review of the
                        situation.</p>

                    <p>In its note of March sixth, requesting further clarification of the Kiwi
                        reactor safety experiment, the Soviet Government apparently misinterprets
                        the position taken by the United States Government in its Aide-Mémoire of
                        January 26, 1965.<note n="2" xml:id="d73fn2">

                    <p>The position of the United States Government is that the Kiwi experiment did
                        not constitute a “nuclear explosion” within the meaning of the Treaty
                        Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under
                        Water. The experiment was a reactor safety test and its technical
                        characteristics are readily distinguishable from a nuclear explosion.
                        Reactors are legitimately present in all parts of the world; accidents in
                        which they burn up or experiments designed to simulate such accidents have
                        never been considered to be nuclear explosions, and consequently are not
                        within the scope of the Treaty.</p>
                    <p>As a continuation of the discussions in these scientific areas held at the
                        Conference on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy last September in Geneva,
                        detailed descriptions and analyses of the Kiwi experiment will be made
                        available to the world scientific community at the International Symposium
                        on Fission Product Release and Transport Under Accident Conditions, at the
                        Oak Ridge Laboratory during the first week of April. The Soviet Union has
                        been invited to send representatives to attend and participate in that
                        meeting and thus will soon have an opportunity to obtain further information
                        concerning that experiment.</p>

                    <p>At Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s invitation, I
                        joined him at luncheon at the Soviet Embassy about 12:30 p.m. Before sitting
                        down to luncheon, he first asked about the intent of Long Shot.<note n="2" xml:id="d74fn2">Long Shot, a Department of Defense nuclear test
                            detection experiment of about 80 kilotons, took place at Amchitka
                            Island, Alaska, October 29, 1965. (<hi rend="italic">United States
                                Nuclear Tests, July 1945 through September 1992</hi>, p. 21)</note>
                        He outlined his own interpretation <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0234"/>which was that from this experiment we would prove out our theories that
                        we would be able to detect and identify all underground events. With that
                        information added to our present information, he stated his own belief that
                        from a scientific viewpoint there would be no questionable events and,
                        therefore, there would be no need for on-site inspection. He stated his
                        further conclusion that the only reason for on-site inspections was
                        political and in view of the fact that there was no risk to the security of
                        the U.S. because of the possibility of a few unidentified events, it would
                        be well to proceed to a comprehensive test ban, if, indeed, the U.S. still
                        wanted it. I explained that from our viewpoint, while our ability to detect
                        and identify had improved, there was little likelihood that all events could
                        be identified. In view of this, both from a scientific viewpoint and a
                        political viewpoint, there continued to be a requirement for some on-site
                        inspections, even though, as we had stated on a number of occasions, our
                        approach to this requirement is flexible.</p>
                    <p>At luncheon two basic points were discussed. The first had to do with the
                        Ambassador's puzzlement as to why we had not responded to the confidential
                        note on the matter of arms control and disarmament which had now been in our
                        hands almost three months.<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">Reference presumably
                            is to February 1 message from Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, <ref target="#d68">Document 68</ref>.</note> I
                        stated this, in my opinion, was a reasonable question, but that the
                        conditions in the world had been such in the interval, that so far it had
                        not seemed appropriate to respond. The other basic point, and the primary
                        reason that he had asked me to luncheon, concerned a formal Soviet
                        Government proposal which will be made to the U.N. Secretary General, I

                        called attention to the wording of the recess statement and said that, due
                        to “the futility of the discussions at the last session,” it was necessary
                        to discuss the disarmament situation at the U.N.G.A. and, following that
                        discussion, the question of a further return to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> might be decided. The note will apparently call for a
                        convening of the Commission at the earliest possible moment in order to <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0235"/>move ahead with the important work
                        of disarmament. I said that, of course, we would give attention to this
                        immediately when it was officially set forth. I said also that in a
                        preliminary way I had some question regarding the utility of such a
                        discussion, since without instruction from the G.A. on an established
                        procedure or definite time limitations such a Commission with 100 or 115
                        participants could degenerate into a futile exercise. However, the U.S.
                        Government obviously would give appropriate consideration to the proposal
                        and we would be in touch with him further when the official version had been
                        presented.</p>
                    <p>I suggested that it might be useful to consider on a concurrent time basis
                        some bilateral discussion of what might be the most fruitful specific areas
                        for discussion when, as, and if we returned to Geneva.</p>
                    <p>I also said that I would make inquiry as to the status of a response to their
                        earlier official government note on disarmament.</p>
                    <p>Our discussion ended at 2:15.</p>

                        nuclear explosion was conducted, on April 14 of this year in the state of

                        as a result of which there took place the ejection of earth to the surface
                        and the penetration into the atmosphere of released radioactive materials.
                        Inasmuch as this explosion was conducted under the “Plowshare” program and,
                        as is indicated in this same report of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, a
                        crater of large dimension formed at the site of the explosion—350 feet in
                        diameter, 100 feet in depth, and <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0236"/>forming a 60 foot lip—it is evident that with this underground nuclear
                        explosion there took place not an accidental but a pre-planned ejection of a
                        significant amount of earth and, consequently, a pre-planned ejection of
                        radioactive materials into the atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>At the same time it is known that Article I (b) of the Treaty Banning Nuclear
                        Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water contains the
                        obligation of the parties of this Treaty to prohibit, to prevent, and not to
                        carry out any nuclear explosions in any environment, including underground
                        “if such explosion causes radioactive debris to be present outside the
                        territorial limits” of the State which conducts the explosion. In this
                        connection the Soviet Government requests that it be given more detailed
                        information about the nuclear explosion conducted in the U.S.A. on April 14
                        this year since the assertion of the Atomic Energy Commission that the
                        fallout of radioactive debris is within the boundaries of the U.S.A. is
                        unconvincing because the Commission does not control the air streams
                        carrying radioactivity, and there is reason to believe that with the conduct
                        of this explosion there took place a violation of the Treaty banning nuclear
                        weapon tests in three environments.</p>

                    <p>The United States Government has carefully considered the Soviet Government's
                        Aide-Mémoire of April 29, 1965,<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">
                            <ref target="#d75">Document 75</ref>.</note> concerning the April 14,
                        1965, experiment conducted by the United States Atomic Energy Commission as
                        part of a program for developing peaceful uses of nuclear explosions.<note n="3" xml:id="d76fn3">See <ref target="#d75fn2">footnote 2, Document
                            75</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In planning the experiment of April 14, the United States took numerous
                        precautions to avoid violation of the Treaty Banning Nuclear <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0237"/>Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer
                        Space and Underwater. In fact, the purpose of the experiment was to obtain
                        data on a method to enhance the containment of radioactive debris from
                        underground nuclear excavation explosions.</p>
                    <p>The explosion had a yield of about four kilotons and was buried at a depth of
                        280 feet in hard rock. The depth was specifically chosen to be the same,
                        scaled for the size of the explosion, as a previous test which did not
                        produce a crater. As in the case of the previous test, the experiment was
                        permitted to take place only under meteorological conditions carefully
                        chosen to avoid the escape of radioactive debris from the territory of the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>As has been announced, the experiment did produce a crater and small amounts
                        of radioactive debris were projected into the atmosphere. Most of this
                        debris was deposited in the vicinity of the site of the experiment. In
                        accordance with meteorological predictions, the small quantity of
                        radioactive debris which went further was blown northward within the United
                        States for several hundred miles from the Nevada test site and then
                        southeastward over the central United States. During this time, the airborne
                        concentrations of radioactive debris were determined by measurement to have
                        been diluted by fallout, radioactive decay, and dispersion to extremely low
                        levels.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government will continue to take the greatest care in the
                        conduct of nuclear detonations including its program for peaceful uses of
                        nuclear explosions. The United States Government affirms its commitment to
                        the preservation of the Treaty with unimpaired authority.</p>
                    <p>In this connection the Government of the United States believes it necessary
                        to revert to consideration of a very much larger nuclear explosion conducted
                        in the Soviet Union on January 15, 1965,<note n="4" xml:id="d76fn4">Regarding this Soviet test, see <ref target="#d62">Document
                        62</ref>.</note> seemingly directed at a similar application as that of the
                        United States on April 14, 1965, but which resulted in many times as much
                        radioactive debris being released to the atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government has studied Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s oral statements of January
                            25<note n="5" xml:id="d76fn5">

                        that Soviet explosion was detected on the ground by the Radioactivity

                        levels on previous days.</p>
                    <p>If the Soviet Government were more forthcoming in response to the request of
                        the United States Government for further information concerning the January
                        15 Soviet test, the United States Government might be better able to
                        conclude that there was no intention on the part of the Soviet Government to
                        violate the terms of the Treaty. A nuclear explosion such as that of January
                        15, which causes such large amounts of radioactive debris to be present
                        outside the borders of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, causes
                        grave concern. Repetition of such a release of debris outside the borders of
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as occurred after January 15 could
                        jeopardize the very existence of the Treaty, a consequence which the United
                        States would view as extremely serious. The United States Government
                        considers the maintenance of the obligations of this Treaty to be of utmost
                        importance and trusts that the Soviet Government will take every precaution
                        to ensure that the Treaty will be observed.</p>

                        that they had not intended a violation of the Test Ban if they had been more

                    <p>I reminded him that we had asked for further information and that this had
                        been refused. He asked if we really believed they intended to violate the
                        Treaty. I said I did not think so, but that it would have been much easier
                        to say so directly if we had been given more information. He shrugged and
                        said that this was a matter for their atomic people to deal with.</p>

                        lunched with me in my suite at the Waldorf Towers. I wanted to continue the
                        discussion with <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> which we
                        had at the luncheon Ambassador El-Kony gave for us on May 17 (reported in
                        separate memcon).<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2">Not found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>It became perfectly clear from <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>'s first remarks that the position of the Soviet Union
                        has decidedly hardened with reference to a return to Geneva unless and until
                        the U.S. states that it is willing to agree to a number of things, which
                        largely we cannot accept.</p>
                    <p>We had an extensive discussion as to no first use of nuclear weapons.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> contended that as long
                        as the U.S. continued to engage in aggression, such as in Viet Nam and the
                        Dominican Republic, it was impossible to achieve any real agreements. I
                        stated that what we were undertaking in South Viet Nam was not aggression.
                        We had a long argument about the historical background of the 1954
                            Agreements,<note n="3" xml:id="d78fn3">Reference is to the Agreements on

                        which had been called for in 1955, the line between two parts of the same
                        state, and the introduction of U.S. troops which, he said, was <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0240"/>designed through pressure to subjugate
                        South Viet Nam to U.S. desires. <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> expounded on what he said were U.S. attempts to
                        subjugate many countries around the world where the U.S. had bases, troops
                        under the guise of advisers, etc., etc.</p>
                    <p>I brought up the subject of non-proliferation, but this was discussed only
                        briefly since he said that this was directly linked to our desire to give
                        nuclear capabilities to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. As long as
                        the U.S. had that approach there was no way possible to achieve a
                        non-proliferation agreement.</p>
                    <p>I then asked: “What exactly does the U.S.S.R. want as an outcome of the
                        meeting of the <gloss target="#t_UNDC1">UNDC</gloss>?” He said he felt that
                        the <gloss target="#t_UNDC1">UNDC</gloss> must agree on specific
                        arrangements by which we could achieve several things: A Comprehensive Test
                        Ban Treaty; a non-proliferation agreement without <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>; a reduction of bases
                        and troops on foreign territory; a no first use agreement; and a decision to
                        call a world conference on disarmament in which the Chinese would
                        participate. Obviously, several of these are non-starters. As to the world
                        conference, I said that while the U.S. recognized that at some point in
                        disarmament discussions it would be essential for the Chinese to be
                        included, we saw no evidence that their inclusion at the moment would
                        further arrangements on arms reduction and disarmament. I reminded him that
                        we had active and current discussions with the Chinese in Warsaw during
                        which proposals for arms control and disarmament had been suggested by the
                        U.S. but that no affirmative response had ever been received. In view of
                        that it was difficult for us to comprehend how progress could be made by
                        present inclusion of the Chinese at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>, or at a world conference, or at the U.N. itself. It was
                        interesting that when I asked him how he would suggest the Chinese could be
                        included in a way to have constructive results, he shrugged his shoulders
                        and said it was up to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> that we had delivered
                        an aide-mémoire to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> yesterday in response to their questions about the
                        Palanquin shot.<note n="4" xml:id="d78fn4">
                            <ref target="#d75">Documents 75</ref> and <ref target="#d76">76</ref>,
                            respectively.</note> I said that we were quite clear that the Palanquin
                        shot was not a threat to the continuance of the Limited Test Ban Treaty, but
                        we were not so clear that their shot of January 15 was in the same category.
                        We had previously asked the Soviet Union for further information about that
                        shot and about its possible impact on the treaty,<note n="5" xml:id="d78fn5">See <ref target="#d66">Document 66</ref>.</note> and we had reiterated
                        that question because we were concerned about the magnitude of the shot and
                        the extent of radioactivity outside the borders of the Soviet Union. I
                        expressed the personal hope that they continue to believe, as we do, that
                        the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was of great importance and should be
                        supported by both of us.</p>
                    <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0241"/>
                    <p>We moved from that to a discussion of the Comprehensive Test Ban, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> said that this was one
                        of the things where there is no necessity of returning to Geneva, since they
                        were aware of our point of view concerning the requirements for on-site
                        inspections. If we were unable to accept the realities of the situation—no
                        on-site inspection requirements—no progress could be made at Geneva and
                        therefore there was no reason for returning there. I made no impression on
                        him by reiterating the advances which we had made as a result of the
                        extensive research which we had undertaken. <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> said both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. knew that it
                        was possible with national capabilities to detect and identify any
                        violations of a treaty and all that was needed was the utilization of
                        national resources.</p>
                    <p>During the course of the discussion about the Limited Test Ban Treaty,
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> attacked us on the
                        maintenance of the Guantanamo base in Cuba. He said that the U.S. contends
                        that it has troops and bases only in those countries where the people wanted
                        U.S. assistance for purposes of mutual security. He said obviously that the
                        people of Cuba did not want us and therefore we should withdraw. I said that
                        Guantanamo was there because of a long established treaty,<note n="6" xml:id="d78fn6">Reference is to the Agreement for the lease to the
                            United States of lands in Cuba for coaling and naval stations, signed at

                        and that a treaty of this nature continued to be binding. We then had a
                        lengthy discourse on the sanctities of treaties. The point <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> was making was that any time the
                        mood of a people changes, treaties should be abrogated. I said that this was
                        a reason for real concern about their willingness to adhere to treaties and
                        whether we could depend on such arrangements.</p>
                    <p>My conclusion after this extended luncheon (he departed at 4:30) was that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> is operating under
                        harder instructions both as to the return to Geneva and as to the
                        flexibility which he might be able to exhibit on proposals where in the past
                        there has appeared to be some possibility of mutual acceptance.</p>

                        atomic energy program over the next five to ten years.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. In a nuclear test program of more than 15 years duration, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has developed nuclear weapons in a
                        variety of designs and sizes which we believe have yields ranging from
                        fractions of a kiloton up to 100 megatons. Soviet weapons technology has
                        differed from that of the US in certain respects. In thermonuclear weapons,
                        the Soviets have emphasized the development of multimegaton devices rather
                        than relatively small, light weight lower yield weapons, [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. (Paras. 10-14,
                        16-17, Table III)</p>
                    <p>B. In fission weapons the Soviet program has been directed toward development
                        of reliable, efficient, and economical devices. They have emphasized
                        development of unboosted devices but they have also developed some
                        high-performance boosted devices, probably in order to achieve reductions in
                        size and weight. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not
                        declassified</hi>] Our evidence is insufficient to determine whether the
                        Soviets decided not to pursue development of lightweight fission weapons or
                        whether the apparent lack of development in this area is because of our
                        failure to detect the evidence of such a program. However, there have been a
                        number of Soviet tests on which we have little or no data and the Soviets
                        have probably developed and stockpiled a number of fission weapons which we
                        have not identified. (Paras. 18-20, 22-23, Table IV)</p>
                    <p>C. We have detected 11 Soviet underground tests since the test ban treaty
                        took effect in 1963. We believe that most of these were related to
                        thermonuclear rather than fission weapons, possibly directed toward
                        development of [5-1/2 lines of source text not declassified]. The rate of
                        underground testing detected to date does not indicate that the Soviets have
                        made an extensive effort to improve their fission weapon technology. (Paras.
                        15, 21)</p>
                    <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0243"/>
                    <p>D. The Soviets are continuing an active weapon development program which is
                        almost certainly creating new test requirements. This, together with the
                        active US program of underground testing is probably generating considerable
                        pressures for a vigorous test program. The pace of Soviet underground
                        testing will probably increase. However, we do not believe that research,
                        development, and military requirements will become so pressing as to cause
                        the Soviets to withdraw from the treaty in the near term. (Para. 31)</p>
                    <p>E. In thermonuclear weapon technology, an area in which the Soviets could
                        make significant advances—the submegaton and low megaton yield range—is
                        susceptible to improvement by underground testing. Future improvement in
                        fission devices could be in the direction of further development of small
                        diameter [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                        declassified</hi>] warheads. The Soviets could also obtain a limited amount
                        of data on weapons effects by underground testing, but one of their
                        strong-est requirements in this area—effects data on high-altitude nuclear

                    <p>F. The Soviets are continuing to expand their facilities for the production
                        of fissionable materials. Our estimates indicate that by 1975 Soviet [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 production will increase by more than
                        one-third, resulting in nearly a four-fold increase in cumulative production
                        by that date. These estimates are subject to wide margins of error.
                        Nevertheless, a significant expansion of these facilities has continued
                        despite <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s statement to the
                        contrary in April 1964.<note n="2" xml:id="d79fn2">For the views of the

                    <p>G. In industrial and military applications of power and propulsion reactors,
                        the Soviet program has been characterized by certain technological
                        weaknesses. Inadequate developmental testing has tended to degrade
                        operational reliability, chemical engineering has lagged, and capabilities
                        in stainless steel technology has been notably weak. As a result, the
                        Soviets encountered major problems with their first marine propulsion
                        system. This system has been considerably modified and improved and probably
                        will give satisfactory performance in the newer ships and submarines. But
                        the Soviets are still several years behind the US in marine propulsion
                        technology. Technological difficulties, together with economic constraints,
                        have also slowed the Soviet nuclear electric power program. The Soviets are
                        now embarked upon a program of expansion which incorporates many of the
                        power reactor concepts under development in the West, but we doubt that they
                        will achieve their planned expansion to a 2,000 megawatt generating capacity
                        by 1970. (Paras. 39-45)</p>

                    <p>H. Soviet research reactors appear to be adequate in quality and quantity to
                        meet the needs of the atomic energy program, although nuclear research has
                        probably been hampered somewhat by deficiencies in instrumentation and by
                        the limited availability of large fast computers. Reactor research seems
                        directed toward power and propulsion application with emphasis on
                        containment materials, coolants, moderators, and fuels capable of
                        withstanding high irradiation levels and temperatures. (Paras. 37-38)</p>
                    <p>I. More advanced research in thermoelectricity and thermionics will probably
                        find application in space power supplies, which will eventually permit the
                        use of electric propulsion systems in space. The Soviet program of research
                        on controlled thermonuclear reactions is the world's largest, and Soviet
                        scientists have made major advances in plasma physics. We do not believe,
                        however, that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will achieve a
                        controlled fusion reactor in the next ten years. (Paras. 45-51)</p>

                    <p>Your letter to the President of February 18, 1965, transmitting a document,
                        “The National Nuclear Test Program,” has been noted.<note n="2" xml:id="d80fn2">A sanitized version of <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>'s February 18 letter is in <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>, Journal, Vol. 10, pp.
                        184-186.</note> It was also noted that the plan contained in the document is
                        sufficiently broad in scope as to provide maximum flexibility of response in
                        the event we should have need to resume testing in any of the environments
                        now prohibited by the Limited Test Ban Treaty. This approach is sound;
                        flexibility <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0245"/>should continue to
                        characterize our planning. In addition, we should continue to keep in mind
                        the thought expressed in your letter that any test series which might
                        eventually be conducted in any of the prohibited environments would be
                        developed in response to the particular objectives considered most important
                        at the time. Such tests might be somewhat different and fewer in number from
                        those contemplated in “The National Nuclear Test Program” as presently
                        drafted.</p>
                    <p>At several points in the document, there is expressed an expectation that
                        underground testing would continue essentially unchanged and at
                        approximately the same rate even after we resume testing in the atmosphere.
                        This assumption seems open to question. The need for and feasibility of
                        continuing a full-blown underground testing program simultaneously with
                        atmospheric testing would be a matter on which the President would have to
                        decide. I suggest that those portions of the document that appear to
                        establish such assumptions with respect to underground testing be revised to
                        leave the question open.</p>
                    <p>I also request one other revision in the document, a change in the section on
                        ultra-high yield weapons to make it explicit that the President has not yet
                        made a decision as to how far the development of such weapons will be
                        carried. Except as indicated above, it appears that “The National Nuclear
                        Test Program” document is an excellent statement of the current plan for
                        continuing to maintain the state of readiness which has already been
                        achieved by the Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
                    <p>It is requested that the plan contained in the document be periodically
                        reviewed to ensure that it takes into account the advances made in our
                        underground test program and by the other research and development work at
                        the laboratories. In addition, the plan should be reviewed in collaboration
                        with the Secretary of State and the Director of the Arms Control and
                        Disarmament Agency to ensure that the planning takes place with appropriate
                        political guidance and in light of our best estimate of significant
                        developing conditions. Any significant changes that occur in the program and
                        the reasons for them should be brought to the attention of the President
                        either on a periodic basis or whenever the program is formally revised.</p>

                        Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of Defense in fiscal year 1966
                        (Flintlock), and the detailed plan for the first quarter (July-September
                        1965), Flintlock I. The fiscal year 1966 budget allowed for a program of
                        42-46 weapons development tests, 5-7 Plowshare tests, 10 effects tests, and
                        3-5 detection tests, but <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>
                        described some 45-57 Atomic Energy Commission events and 13-15 Department of
                        Defense events to allow sufficient latitude in the final underground test
                        program. In addition, one British event (Charcoal), <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> stated, had been approved for the

                        which <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>'s letter was referred,
                        recommended among other things approval in principle of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> proposal for fiscal year 1966 underground

                        would be given further technical review. The Committee would later advise
                        the President if the review would result in further deferral of the tests.
                        It withheld approval of the Plowshare catering experiments and the Vela

                        of the underground nuclear test program for the fourth quarter of fiscal
                        year 1966, Flintlock IV, consisting of 16 Atomic Energy Commission and 4
                        Department of Defense tests, including 5 events postponed from the third
                        quarter due to the unstable labor situation at the Nevada Test Site. Three
                        of the tests would employ vertical lines of sight to the surface, permitting
                        weapons effects measurements. It was expected that <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0248"/>each test would be conducted within the
                        constraints of the limited test ban treaty. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966, Flintlock Series, Vol. IV, Box 28)</p>
                    <p>In a memorandum of March 31 to <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> approved the testing program proposed for the fourth
                        quarter of fiscal year 1966. (Ibid.) In a letter of May 26 to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">W.W. Rostow</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> advised modification of Flintlock IV, deferring one
                        test (Ajax) for technical reasons and adding two less complex tests (Puce
                        and the Plowshare test Vulcan). The modification lay within the scope of the
                        underground test program for the fiscal year and resulted in an increase of
                        one test over the program approved by the President for the fourth quarter.

                    <p>After almost two months of discussion, the United Nations Disarmament
                        Commission adjourned on June 16, having adopted two resolutions: (1) a
                        Yugoslav-sponsored resolution recommending that the General Assembly
                        urgently consider the convening of a world disarmament conference “to which
                        all countries would be invited”<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">Resolution
                            DC/224, adopted by the U.N. Disarmament Commission, June 11, 1965.
                            (Yearbook of the United Nations, 1965, p. 47)</note> and (2) a
                        “non-aligned”-sponsored resolution recommending the early resumption of the
                        Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee at Geneva to consider various
                        measures, with particular emphasis on a comprehensive test ban and
                        non-proliferation.</p>
                    <p>The resolution on the world conference was adopted by a vote of 89-0, with 16
                        abstentions. However, vigorous lobbying by the United States delegation had
                        succeeded in obtaining some revisions in the resolution, including deletion
                        of one of its more objectionable features. The United States abstained, but
                        most <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, led by the United
                        Kingdom supported the revised proposal. The predominant issue was the
                        strongly expressed desire of most members to associate the Chinese
                        Communists with disarmament negotiations and the desire on the part of many
                        to bring them, via such negotiations, into the United Nations, although some
                        said they expected only to create a situation where the Chinese Communists
                        negative attitude toward disarmament could be fully exposed.</p>
                    <p>Despite opposition by the Soviet Union, the “non-aligned” resolution carried
                        83-1-18, with the United States supporting despite some reservations,
                        Albania opposing, and the Soviet bloc abstaining. Until the very last moment
                        the Soviets made strenuous—but unsuccessful—efforts to have that resolution
                        revised so as to omit language implying a condemnation of Chinese nuclear
                        explosions and to include a formulation on non-proliferation aimed at
                        possible <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> multilateral arrangements.</p>

                    <p>The most salient features of the Disarmament Commission's session were:</p>
                    <p>(a) the coming to the surface of a growing resistance on the part of
                        non-nuclear states, particularly those which are potential nuclear states,
                        to a non-proliferation arrangement prohibiting acquisition of nuclear
                        weapons without imposing any obligations on nuclear states in terms of
                        limitations on, or reduction in, their own nuclear capabilities;</p>
                    <p>(b) the relative sophistication and realism displayed by many delegations in
                        the course of the debate, in large part due to the leadership displayed by
                        the Eight who had participated in the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>
                        at Geneva and who were well informed as to the substantive issues involved;</p>
                    <p>(c) the obvious misjudgment by the Soviets of their ability to use its
                        attacks on United States action in Viet Nam and the Dominican Republic as a
                        means of ramming through two politically motivated resolutions; and</p>
                    <p>(d) growing sentiment that the deadlock between the great powers should be
                        broken by mobilizing the voices of the world at large, coupled with the
                        desire on the part of some of the non-aligned—particularly Yugoslavia, the

                        in that effort and thus strengthen their general position of leadership

                    <p>On the basis of our contacts with the Soviets in New York, it appears
                        questionable that they will agree to a resumption of <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> negotiations this summer. They have
                        expressed skepticism about the usefulness of reconvening the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> in the absence of prospects for

                    <p>The President has directed the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency to
                        prepare for submission to him a proposed new program of arms control and
                        disarmament, including a proposed program for preventing the further spread
                        of nuclear weapons. The initiative in preparing this program should be with
                        the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. Its proposals should be
                        presented to the President together with preliminary comments from other
                        interested agencies of government. The purpose of this procedure is to

                        force indefinitely subject to the right of any signatory to withdraw from

                    <p>2. We do not see that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> draft has any
                        advantages over US 1963 proposal, although we are prepared, of course, to
                        listen to British arguments in this connection.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> draft has number of substantial
                        drawbacks in our view. We consider particularly that it would be tactically
                        dangerous to negotiate on basis <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        formulation whereby exclusion of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> from ban on transfer of control of nuclear
                        weapons to “any association of states” (Article I (1)) hangs tenuously on
                        definition of “control” in separate and subsequent article (Article III
                        (c)). Exposed definition of “control” might be so tempting a target for
                        Soviet negotiators that it could be self-defeating in terms of Western
                        effort to bring Soviets to face-saving agreement.</p>
                    <p>4. Language of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> draft would also limit
                        evolution of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> under “European clause” by requiring maintenance of veto by one
                        of existing nuclear powers. The “European clause” was introduced into <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> discussions in response to apparent desire
                        of Europeans and in reflection their aspirations towards eventual political
                        unity. As far as US is concerned, we are not ourselves insisting that any
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>
                        charter must include a “European clause,” but we do wish to respond
                        effectively to largest possible consensus among interested European allies,
                        and their collective view of this matter is not yet clear.</p>
                    <p>5. As indicated above, we are ready to introduce in non-proliferation
                        agreement withdrawal clause similar to that in test ban.</p>
                    <p>6. We continue to attach importance to having agreement cast in terms of
                        prohibiting transferring weapons into national control of individual states
                        so as not to leave any ambiguity re effect of agreement on <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0255"/>new <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        nuclear arrangements such as <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> which in our view are consistent with our
                        non-proliferation objectives and should not be precluded by
                        non-proliferation agreement.</p>

                    <p>[Here follows a discussion on agricultural matters.]</p>
                    <p>The Governor stated that he was glad to inform Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had read with great care his report
                        of their previous conversation.<note n="2" xml:id="d86fn2">The substance of
                            Harriman's July 15 conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was transmitted in enclosure 1 to A-120 from Moscow,
                            July 22. (Ibid.)</note> The President, he said, shares Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s view that the U.S. and
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> have heavy responsibilities for
                        the maintenance of peace. “You may be assured,” the Governor continued,
                        “that U.S. action in Vietnam will be what is necessary—but only what is
                        necessary—to stop the armed attacks which have been mounted, under the
                        direction of Hanoi, against the people and government of South Vietnam. The
                        President agrees with your emphasis on (1) the tasks of disarmament; (2) the
                        importance of bilateral relations between our two countries and (3) the
                        advantage of personal contact in appropriate circumstances.<pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0256"/> The President is now making a final review
                        of our disarmament position for the meeting in Geneva. He hopes very much
                        that the Soviet Union will join in a constructive approach to these problems
                        and he agrees with the Chairman as to the special importance of
                        non-proliferation.” In this connection, Governor Harriman told Kosygin that
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> would head the U.S.
                        Delegation at Geneva and asked him who would head the Soviet Delegation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that a final decision
                        on this had not yet been reached. However, he assured Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> that the head of the Soviet
                        Delegation will be a responsible official fully empowered to act, report,
                        make decisions and not just “sit on the fence.” When asked by Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> as to whether he had any
                        comments on the Governor's previous statement, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that he was pleased to learn that the
                        President is concerned about the same problems which bothered him. He was
                        personally convinced that progress could be made on the questions which had
                        been discussed and to which the President had reacted, if it were not for
                        Vietnam. The Vietnamese problem is an impediment to the solution of many
                        important problems such as disarmament, nuclear weapons and the like. The
                        reasons why progress cannot be made in these fields, he said, now boils down
                        to a lack of confidence between us. “I would like to venture my personal
                        opinion that if it were not for the Vietnam issue we could find a new
                        approach to the disarmament problem, a different angle to view it from than
                        that which we have used in the past. One possibility would be for a meeting
                        to be held—not necessarily in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or
                        U.S., it doesn't matter where—prior to a disarmament conference where a
                        fundamental understanding could be reached on these important issues. A
                        meeting of two or more heads of state or government might reach a prior
                        understanding in principle and make a disarmament conference more
                        productive. Such a meeting could in a matter of hours make important
                        decisions in principle, which might require years of discussion at a formal
                        conference. On questions relating to nuclear arms and disarmament no side
                        can be dishonest since, sooner or later, lies must come to the surface and
                        destroy mutual confidence. Naturally, progress could be made by conventional
                        methods as well, but faster progress might be made by adopting
                        unconventional ones. However, nothing can be done today because of the
                        Vietnamese problem. Thus, the Vietnamese problem—which is a small
                        problem—becomes large and influences all other important issues.”</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> asked whether this
                        meant that Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would be
                        willing to meet President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> to
                        discuss these issues. He also inquired as to whether Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was thinking in terms of a
                        bilateral meeting, or one which would include other heads of state.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that his ideas on
                        this subject had not yet been worked out, but that he did not exclude either
                        bilateral or multilateral <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0257"/>high-level meetings. For example, in connection with such an important
                        problem as non-proliferation both forums could be useful. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> emphasized the real relief
                        throughout the world if agreement in these fields could be reached.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said that he knows
                        the wisdom of Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s
                        words from personal experience. The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty which he had
                        signed in 1963 was only a small step, but it had been greeted with great
                        relief all over the world. Wherever he went, the Governor said, people still
                        talk about it. If we could move further toward disarmament, any such steps
                        would, of course, be greeted with even greater relief by the people of the
                        world. The Governor referred to the fact that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France and unfortunately Peiping are now involved in nuclear
                        issues and asked <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> whether the
                        problem of dealing with the Chinese might be discussed bilaterally between
                        the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that the Chinese were
                        not a major issue. The U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are
                        the only real owners of nuclear weapons. Others have some capability, he
                        said, but are not now of any importance. However, science is making great
                        strides and is the property of all states. Cheaper bombs, which do not
                        require the present tremendous amount of electric power for their
                        manufacture, will be developed, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said. Many states will thus be able to possess nuclear
                        weapons and when this happens, there will be no guarantees as to who might
                        take these weapons into their hands. Hitler existed in the past. What
                        guarantees are there that another Hitler will not arise tomorrow? he asked.
                        “These weapons are terrible. We must do all in our power to prevent
                        proliferation of these weapons. This is why the American proposal to pool
                        nuclear weapons—which amounts to giving weapons to the Germans—arouses such
                        emotional opposition in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.” The
                        Soviet Union, he said, would be forced to respond by sharing nuclear weapons
                        with its own allies.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> fully shares the first
                        part of Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s statement.
                        Regarding <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had previously pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should sign the non-proliferation treaty and thus prevent
                        forever the possibility of independent possession of nuclear weapons in
                        Germany. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> told
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that the U.S., like the
                        Soviets, had suffered twice from aggressive German leadership and was
                        mindful of the possibility that such leadership could arise in the future.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> must believe that the
                        U.S. does not want the Germans to possess nuclear weapons independently. The
                        Governor stressed that he was speaking very frankly and that it would be
                        most unfortunate if what he had just said were discussed with others. He
                        stated that he was encouraged to speak in an open manner because of the
                        frankness which <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had displayed
                        in their last conversation in speaking of Soviet problems with the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows a discussion on Germany.]</p>
                    <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0258"/>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> offered to bring
                        back any message on Germany which Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would like to send to the President. He then
                        inquired as to when Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                        thought a high level meeting could be held on nuclear questions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that such a meeting
                        was both possible and necessary but that it could only take place when the
                        Vietnam issue leaves the scene. Such a meeting would not be possible earlier
                        since, if it took place, everybody would think that the meeting was only to
                        discuss Vietnam. What is immediately necessary, he said, is to end the war
                        in Vietnam as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows a discussion on Vietnam.]</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> stressed the hope
                        that everything will be done to minimize the influence of the Vietnam issue
                        on bilateral relations. He referred to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s observations in his previous talk that the U.S. had
                        violated a commitment to reduce its military budget by making a
                        supplementary allocation of $700 million to deal with the Vietnam situation,
                        and presented <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> with the
                        following memorandum (based on Deptel 190).<note n="3" xml:id="d86fn3">Telegram 190 to Moscow, July 17, is ibid., POL 7 US/<persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>.</note> Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said that this memorandum

                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at the outset of
                            their December 5, 1964, meeting. (Secto 28 from <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, December 5, 1964; Department of State, Central Files,

                    <p>Whether and when supplemental appropriations will be requested for fiscal
                        year 1966 depends upon developments in Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, after glancing at the
                        memorandum (which was in English), repeated that according to U.S.
                        statements, it is planning to increase its budgetary appropriation by $700
                        million. He hit on the figure of $50.4 billion (for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965) in the memo, stating that this was a figure which had
                        been published previously and that the $700 million must, therefore,
                        increase that figure. “My memory is very good. I remember figures,” he said.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> noted that we may
                        have to increase our military expenditures if the situation in Southeast
                        Asia worsens.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that if faced with a
                        similar situation, the Soviet Union would have given very serious thought as
                        to whether it would increase its own military expenditures; and that if it
                        found it necessary to do so, would only take such action after informing the
                        other side.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> explained that the
                        figures given in the memo clearly show that the savings, even including the
                        $700 million appropriation for Southeast Asia, were much greater than
                        previously anticipated and considerably below the figure which Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had quoted to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> added that 1965 expenditures,
                        including those for Vietnam, are $3.8 billion less than those for 1964.
                        Savings in other directions have more than offset additional expenditures
                        for Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> stated that another point
                        which bothers the Soviets is that in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> funds not expended by the end of the fiscal year are
                        terminated, whereas in the U.S. such funds continue to be available to the
                        Defense Department.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> quickly responded
                        that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was ready to
                        appoint an expert to meet either in Moscow or Washington to consult with a
                        Soviet expert on mutual budgetary structure and practices in order that
                        there could be understanding of each other's methods. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> responded that if this issue were
                        connected with disarmament<pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0260"/>
                        measures, then a need might indeed arise to examine each other's procedures.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> opened the meeting by saying to
                            <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName> (<persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>) that he has quite a party coming up to discuss
                        disarmament, although we may be rearming the very day that he gets to
                        Geneva. He asked him to comment on the strategy of starting the meeting when
                        he gets there. He asked whether <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> might open by making a statement updating what we have
                        already proposed, or whether he should make a general policy statement
                        possibly preceded by private talks with the Russians.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said he thought he would start
                        with a statement as to why we are in Viet Nam and he would go back to the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> letter of January 8,

                        the answer from President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> of
                        January 21, 1964;<note n="3" xml:id="d87fn3">Not found; reference presumably

                            (See <ref target="#d2fn6">footnote 6, Document 2</ref>)</note> he would
                        describe the nuclear threat that faces the world, especially the
                        proliferation problem. He thought that this might all be in his own
                        statement, not a Presidential statement. Then he would go to <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> to talk privately, emphasizing
                        that in spite of Viet Nam the nuclear race needs to be controlled. He would
                        point out that there have been many meetings last year and this year, and
                        that 114 Nations are vitally interested in the outcome.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said to <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> that he would have to deal with Viet
                        Nam rather directly, pointing out that we are willing to cooperate, but that
                        our efforts<pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0261"/> have not borne any
                        fruit, and that he might recapitulate those efforts. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> protested that too much detail on
                        Viet Nam might lead to the wrong impression as to our objectives, and he
                        said that the Soviets will certainly bring up this question in any case.
                        Foster pointed out that the Soviets will be the first to speak.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> again made the observation that
                        Tuesday of next week, the opening day of the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> Conference, will be a hell of a day to make a speech on
                            disarmament.<note n="4" xml:id="d87fn4">Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> possibly had in mind the decision
                            to increase U.S. fighting strength in Vietnam announced by President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> at a news conference
                            on July 28, the day after the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee

                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> when he planned to leave.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said he would leave on
                        Saturday morning, seeing the British on the way, at their request. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then read from a message that he is
                        sending to the British<note n="5" xml:id="d87fn5">
                            <ref target="#d88">Document 88</ref>.</note> in which he is sharply
                        critical of the British response to our counter proposals to their draft
                        treaty on nonproliferation. This message would state that a reply is hoped
                        for before July 26. The problem is that Germany insists on retaining the
                        concept of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, while the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> resists putting in any nonproliferation
                        agreement statements which provide for a <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The British feel that this weakens the nonproliferation treaty
                        in a serious manner. Bundy suggested that we might try to persuade the
                        British to add a clause which would be helpful with the Germans, and less
                        objectionable to the British. This language was handed out at the meeting by
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>, and is attached to this
                            memorandum.<note n="6" xml:id="d87fn6">Not found.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked if this language would
                        permit the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, and Bundy responded that it
                        would. Bundy was concerned that we should not table something in the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> that would lead to a civil war of words
                        among the Western Alliance. Foster pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had already tabled their resolution in the
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>.<note n="7" xml:id="d87fn7">Not
                            further identified.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that in his opinion the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> wouldn't do much before their
                        election. He also said he thought Germany would not give up the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. Perhaps it would be best to find out what
                        the Russians have in mind by talking to them before we start; their aim may
                        be primarily to break up the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s Select Committee,<note n="8" xml:id="d87fn8">Reference is to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Select Committee proposed by <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>

                        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, etc. Bundy again stated that the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> objects to the US version of the

                        Bundy suggested that the <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> message
                        should be sent to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> so that we could see
                        what their response would be. He read a copy of <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>'s speech of December 16, 1964, and said that he
                        thought our language is consistent with this and that we should say this in
                        the <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> memorandum to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        agreed to this. Bundy and others suggested that maybe the Soviets would
                        agree to going back to the earlier '63 language<note n="11" xml:id="d87fn11">See <ref target="#d85fn3">footnote 3, Document 85</ref>.</note> saying
                        they would withdraw from any nonproliferation agreement if there should turn
                        out to be a <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> made the observation that it is entirely possible that
                        by the time a MLF came into being that the Soviets would say that it isn't a
                        proliferation step. In any case, we shouldn't conclude this nonproliferation
                        agreement before the German elections. Bundy summarized by saying that we

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then suggested to <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> that we go back to a discussion of
                        his opening statement. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said
                        that he would probably open by defending our valid position in Viet Nam,
                        probably as a response to an earlier Soviet statement on this. He would
                        re-emphasize the continued US resolve to respond to subversion; he would
                        then say something on the nonproliferation question and something on the
                        need for a comprehensive test ban treaty and something on the destruction of
                        nuclear warheads.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he doubted that <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> should say anything on the
                        destruction of nuclear warheads on Tuesday, in view of the other statement
                        that would be issued about then concerning our future plans in Viet Nam.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said that he had in mind
                        saying that such destruction would be on the basis of the transfer of
                        fissionable material to peaceful uses.</p>
                    <p> Bundy agreed that this might not be the right thing to say early next week.
                        We couldn't be in the position of going in to get new Congressional
                        authority and then mention at the same time that we were going to destroy
                        nuclear warheads, creating the impression that we did not need them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> was of the opinion that perhaps
                        the best strategy would be to go into a general negotiating situation,
                        discussing these matters for about a week or so before revealing our
                        detailed position.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> expressed the opinion that
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> should limit his statement
                        to the nonproliferation treaty and the comprehensive test ban, or at least
                        give these the emphasis. He said he thought that <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> should proceed like a boxer, and feel them out for a
                        while before committing himself. He should let someone else carry the ball.
                        It might be all right to also propose a cutoff of fissionable material with
                        emphasis on peaceful uses. He said that if we do all the rest that we plan
                        for next Tuesday, and tell the Nation that we have a hell of a job in Viet
                        Nam and that we are in a hell of a mess in Viet Nam, we shouldn't at the
                        same time say we're cutting back on warheads. <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> said he thinks we can sell the nonproliferation
                        concept and that we can sell the comprehensive test ban.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> remonstrated that we have an
                        approved position in the US on the destruction of warheads. He then went on
                        to ask if there was general agreement on what he might say about the
                        comprehensive test ban treaty, reading from a memorandum that had been
                        prepared as a possible guide for a Presidential message on this.

                        this was nothing more than the language that Stevenson had used in

                        <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> then read the entire

                        included reference to the need for inspections.</p>
                    <p> Bundy and <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> both agreed with
                            <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> shouldn't make a statement that
                        would make it impossible to maintain the position that we would need
                        inspections, or that would decrease the flexibility of our ultimate position
                        because we have not yet decided on the various alternatives for a
                        comprehensive test ban treaty. Bundy emphasized that we shouldn't tie our
                        hands. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> countered with the

                        Aperture Seismic Arrays, which were yet to be built and demonstrated, and to

                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> summarized by saying that perhaps
                        we should recommend to the President that he give a brief message of
                        greeting and that Foster would make the main speech.</p>
                    <p> Bundy suggested that with respect to the comprehensive test ban treaty,
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> use both parts of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> statement, that is,
                        that significant success had been achieved with underground detection, but
                        that verification is still needed in a treaty.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> whether he now had what he needed, and <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said that he thought he did, that he
                        basically needed instructions on the content of his message to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>, and instructions to be tough with the
                        British on Sunday.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> said he thought that the
                        thing to worry about most in Geneva would be the Russians on Viet Nam, and
                        on the attitude of some of the nonaligned countries. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said he didn't think we needed to
                        worry about the nonaligned countries, and <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> answered that he hoped <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> was right.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> pointed out that this will be
                        a closed session, although it was also noted that there would be the usual
                        corridor briefings of the newspaper people.</p>
                    <p> Bundy, in a recapitulation, said that we would be counter-attacking on Viet
                        Nam following a Russian opening statement, and <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> agreed that this was the best approach. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said he would have a contingency
                        statement ready for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had never before been confronted with a
                        disagreement between the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> such
                        as this, and he said that, therefore, a longer meeting than planned would be
                        necessary with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The meeting broke up with the understanding that the President would give a
                        general message of greeting, and that <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> would make an opening statement that included a rebuttal
                        on Viet Nam, and statements on the US desire for a nonproliferation treaty
                        and for a comprehensive nuclear test ban, with the description of the
                        comprehensive test ban to be general enough so as not to tie our hands in
                        the future. Possibly <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s message
                        should include some other aspects of arms limitations as well, such as
                        cutoff of fissionable material.</p>

                        as virtually certain, results clearly contrary to your interests and ours.
                        Following the sharpest of disagreements within the North Atlantic Alliance,
                        in which the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> draft treaty could not
                        receive support from at least the United States and the Federal Republic of
                        Germany, other even more unfortunate developments would be bound to occur.
                        There could be no successful negotiation of the treaty at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> without the support of the United States
                        or the willingness of the Federal Republic of Germany to sign it. This would
                        present a heaven-sent opportunity to the Soviets both to exploit allied
                        differences and to rebuff United Kingdom efforts as unacceptable in view of
                        the provision that would still permit some form of nuclear sharing within
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Only you could judge the
                        political gains or losses for your government. But such developments could
                        clearly not be regarded as advantageous to the Government of the Federal
                        Republic of Germany in terms of its elections only two months from now. In
                        my own country there would inevitably arise further doubts about the
                        effectiveness of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance.</p>
                    <p>“I am aware of your Prime Minister's statements in the House of Commons on
                        this subject, particularly those on December 16, 1964, that we should not
                        have any new fingers on the nuclear trigger.<note n="6" xml:id="d88fn6">See
                                <ref target="#d87fn10">footnote 10, Document 87</ref>.</note> I
                        believe that the language that we have proposed—that there should be no
                        increase in the total number of States and other organizations having
                        independent power to use nuclear weapons—takes this consideration into
                        account.</p>
                    <p>“Further, it seems to me that we should not anticipate too much the attitude
                        of the Soviet Union in the forthcoming Geneva talks. They have indicated
                        non-proliferation as a matter of high priority to them. We do not know
                        whether they will amend their previous objections arising from possible
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear arrangements. We should
                        face candidly, I think, the fact that Soviet objections are spurious and
                        have nothing to do with the central problem of non-proliferation. They have
                        strongly condemned the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> and now even the special committee
                        suggested by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> finally confessed to me
                        that their objections to <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> were not based
                        solely upon non-proliferation. <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0267"/>They
                        clearly would like to block any increased cohesiveness in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and to create as much dissension as
                        possible in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ranks.</p>
                    <p>“I felt that our counter proposals with respect to a draft which your
                        government could table at <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and in the
                            <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> were constructive and went a very
                        long way toward meeting your needs. Some margins of dissatisfaction on the
                        part of some of your colleagues seem to me to be offset by the disadvantage
                        of tabling proposals which the United States could not accept. Our intimate
                        cooperation in the nuclear field over the years would make such a divergence
                        of view inexplicable.</p>
                    <p>“Given all that is at stake with regard to our mutual basic interests, I
                        would be deeply grateful for a reply, hopefully before July 26, indicating
                        that your government is prepared to adopt a position that we here could
                        support.</p>

                    <p>I am as anxious as you are not to cause strains in the Alliance or to allow
                        the Russians to exploit Western disagreements, although we must recognise
                        that a real difference of view exists between our two Governments on the
                        question of the so-called “European option.” I should make it clear that our
                        draft treaty has been in the hands of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        Governments for several weeks, which should have given ample time for them
                        to form views on it. But we shall certainly want to review our position,
                        rather <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0268"/>than proceed at once to
                        tabling the draft treaty at Geneva, if unfortunately we cannot get a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consensus of view.</p>

                    <p>On July 27, 1965, the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee resumed meetings
                        in Geneva after a recess that began September 17, 1964. In a brief message
                        of greetings to the conference, July 27, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> set forth three objectives of the
                        American delegation: nuclear non-proliferation, limitation of nuclear
                        weapons and nuclear delivery systems, and a comprehensive ban on nuclear
                        weapons tests. (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the

                    <p>At <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Lord Chalfont</persName>'s request, I received
                        him in my apartment at the des Bergues at 4:30 today. He said that the
                        purpose of his visit was to make it clear that his government felt that it
                        must table its present draft treaty with respect to the major articles on
                        nuclear arrangements. Although appreciative of U.S. attempts to find
                        compromise language which would reduce German and Italian opposition to
                        their present language, his government felt that the statements of Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> in December were so
                        explicit on this subject that any backing away from that would be political
                        suicide. They also believed that their formulation was the best possible in
                        order truly to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. He said he recognized
                        that our position is difficult in attempting to develop a European consensus
                        and that as we had said in the Western Four meeting, our suggestions were
                        probably as far as we could go in attempting to help achieve this consensus.
                        He again stated that they had no objection to our proposed safeguards
                        clause, nor to our concern about early tabling of any assurance clause. He
                        said his government would be willing to make some concessions toward the
                        Canadian draft in order to attract Canadian support.<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2">See <ref target="#d85fn2">Document 85, footnote
                        2</ref>.</note> While he recognized our difficulties with the proposed
                        Canadian withdrawal clause including the possible submission of problems and
                        decisions to the Security Council, he felt that they could accept the
                        Canadian formulation to obtain Canadian support.</p>
                    <p>I expressed our disappointment that our suggestions could not be accepted,
                        particularly since he had heard the strong objections to the U.K.
                        formulation of the Germans and the Italians, at Paris and here.</p>
                    <p>I inquired whether some general language which avoided the specific problem
                        of <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        and the majority vote would allow them to change their current position. He
                        said that they had considered this but believed that so much legal ingenuity
                        had been expended in getting where we are that there is little hope for this
                        as a promising course.</p>

                    <p>He said that he and his government had perhaps misread what they thought were

                        they had concluded that the U.S. Government was assigning top priority to
                        non-proliferation, even as against the necessity for achievement of an
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>.
                        In view of that, he believed they may recently have promised too much too
                        soon in the House of Commons and with the press, all of which may have
                        caused much of the present embarrassing differences between the allies. I
                        conceded that he might be right as to the embarrassment. I also said that
                        non-proliferation continued to have top priority with us but that we also
                        continued to support our basic commitments on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>. Until after the German
                        election, at least, any discussion in this field is very difficult for the
                        present German government. This political problem for the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was much like his own estimate of his
                        proposal as being essential for the political health of his own government.</p>
                    <p>In an attempt to find a possible way out of this dilemma, I inquired whether
                        the speculation which I had heard from some source, which source I did not
                        recall, as to their possible willingness, although admittedly reluctant, to
                        accept as amendments our Articles I, II, and IV, after a U.K. treaty had
                        been tabled. He said that this offered possibilities, and if they could
                        table their present draft with some possible Canadian amendments and
                        possibly the safeguard clause added, then we or one of our allies, or even
                        one of the non-aligned, might offer U.S. amendments and they could (in what
                        could be made to appear reluctantly) accept the amendments. They then would
                        have carried out their political commitment.</p>
                    <p>I said that this appeared to have possibilities and it might be that we could
                        advise our allies that we still did not like Articles I, II and III, of the
                        U.K. draft, as we have already informed the British. However, by agreement,
                        we could perhaps publicly commend the British for their initiative but
                        stating in low key that we would have to give more thought to their
                        formulation since it had features which we felt were not the wisest. We
                        would need to discuss such a statement with our allies before presenting it,
                        so that each could weigh the political consequences, and, indeed, we would
                        need to develop a scenario that could help answer many of our problems. I
                        said that I hoped the British had also considered the political cost of
                        appearing to diverge from a unified position with the U.S., both in <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0271"/>terms of cohesion of the alliance
                        and in terms of possible attacks from their conservative opponents at home.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Lord Chalfont</persName> said he recognized
                        this problem and hoped that any public evidence of the differences could be
                        minimal.</p>
                    <p>In concluding, he asked that our discussion and his personal tentative
                        favorable reaction to this sort of plan be kept in the closest confidence
                        while he discussed it back home as he presumed I would do also. I told him
                        that I would only discuss it with Washington and with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BG5">Bunn</persName> here in view of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BG5">Bunn</persName>'s participation in treaty activities.
                        He said that he would discuss it only with his associate, Sir Harold Beeley,
                        and that we could consult again later in the week when we had word back from
                        home.</p>
                    <p>He raised the question of the Italian position. I said we had not heard, but
                        we both agreed that if we and the U.K. and probably the Canadians, agreed
                        with the plan, and also the Germans came along, that the Italians could
                        undoubtedly be persuaded also to accept.</p>

                    <p>On August 17, 1967, the U.S. Delegation to the Conference of the
                        Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee submitted the U.S. proposal for a
                        treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. (<hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament,
                        1965</hi>, pages 347-349) In his statement presenting the draft treaty to the
                        Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee on August 17, Foster said that the
                        draft treaty was the product of consultation among <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries represented at the conference and that it
                        embodied “important contributions from Canada, Italy, and the United
                        Kingdom.” (Ibid., page 351) <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>
                        explained the provisions of the treaty to the conference. Regarding Article
                        III dealing with the application of International Atomic Energy Agency
                        safeguards to peaceful nuclear activities, he said “this article does not
                        set forth a precise or completely formulated obligation; but it does clearly
                        indicate a line of policy which all parties undertake to implement; namely
                        that they will help to bring about the application of such safeguards to
                        their own peaceful nuclear activities and to those of other countries.”
                        (Ibid.) He added that “we have drafted this provision to take account of the
                        views of all countries; including those which are not prepared at this time
                        to commit themselves to accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>

                        Presidential statement releasing the draft treaty (not in the file).
                            <persName corresp="#p_KSMJ1">Keeny</persName> stated that the draft

                        in Washington on August 17, 1965. Among other things, it stated that Foster
                        had presented the draft treaty to the Geneva disarmament conference on the
                        President's instructions. The President said: “This draft treaty would bind
                        its signers in a pledge to refrain from actions which would lead to any
                        further increase in the number of nations having the power to unleash
                        nuclear devastation on the world … . It plainly demonstrates that a treaty
                        can be drawn which meets the legitimate interests of nuclear and non-nuclear
                        powers alike.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the

                        indicated that the meeting would begin with a presentation of background
                        material relevant to consideration of a comprehensive test ban treaty.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> began by pointing out the
                        importance that an extension of the test ban treaty to cover underground
                        testing would have as a means of dealing with the question of proliferation
                        of nuclear capabilities. With respect to the objectives of the meeting, he
                        indicated that he believed that as a minimum the U.S. should probably be
                        prepared to make available to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>
                        information on improved present and projected technical capabilities for
                        detecting and identifying seismic events.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FRA4">Frosch</persName> of <gloss target="#t_ARPA1">ARPA</gloss> began the technical presentation by giving estimates of
                        natural seismic events in the Soviet Union as a function of seismic
                        magnitude, and with a discussion of the relationship between the yield of
                        nuclear explosions and the earthquake magnitude scale. In so doing, he
                        treated as extreme examples the possibility of explosions being conducted on
                        the one hand in hard rock and on the other in dry alluvium, pointing out the
                        range of uncertainty in our understanding with respect <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0274"/>to both cases. He indicated that there
                        appear to be limits to testing large yields in alluvium in the Soviet Union
                        because, so far as we know, it is not available in sufficient depth. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FRA4">Frosch</persName> then summarized the
                        results of a recent analysis of present and projected capabilities for
                        detecting and identifying seismic events. [<hi rend="italic">11-1/2 lines of

                        he gave estimates as a function of magnitude of the number of natural
                        seismic events that could not be distinguished from possible explosions
                        (indicating for example, that with the system of <gloss target="#t_LASA1">LASA</gloss>'s and ocean bottom seismometers there would be on an
                        average approximately 30 such events per year in the Soviet Union of

                            (2 Feb 65), Aug. 1965)</note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> indicated his personal reservation that the Germans
                        might not go along with the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> asked about the
                        possibility of Soviet evasion, to which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FRA4">Frosch</persName> replied that he felt that it would be possible for
                        them to evade successfully at very low yields provided they were willing to
                        make a considerable effort, but he considered it doubtful that very large
                        tests, and in particular more than one or two large tests, could be done
                        clandestinely. Thus, he felt that evasion around 2 kt would be feasible
                        provided there were sufficient effort made, but that at yield levels
                        significantly above that it would be difficult. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines
                            of source text not declassified</hi>] In response to a question from Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>, he indicated that
                        clandestine testing at significant yields above ground would be very
                        difficult.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Howard then presented the results of some analyses of the implications of
                        continuation of the present treaty, a threshold treaty, and a comprehensive
                            treaty.<note n="4" xml:id="d93fn4">According to the agenda of the
                            meeting this item was entitled “'The Military Consequences of
                            Alternative Test Ban Proposals,' dated August 11, 1965 (being reviewed
                            in light of <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> comments) by Jack Howard, Assistant to
                            the Secretary of Defense.” (Johnson Library, National Security File,

                        14)</note> In so doing, he indicated those areas where there was a consensus
                        within the Government and where there were differences in view, particularly
                        involving the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss>. He first
                        discussed the implication for the US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        balance in offensive strategic systems, then in defensive systems, and then
                        very briefly implications with respect to tactical nuclear weapons, and to
                        the US-Chinese Communist <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0275"/>balance.
                        With respect to the last point, he observed that the Chinese position
                        relative to that of the US and the Soviet Union will improve whether or not
                        we and the Soviet Union test or not. Finally, he discussed the effect of the
                        various treaties on the degree to which we would be able to meet
                        requirements of the “<persName corresp="#p_JHM1">Jackson</persName>”
                            safeguards,<note n="5" xml:id="d93fn5">The “<persName corresp="#p_JHM1">Jackson</persName>” safeguards, presumably by Senator <persName corresp="#p_JHM1">Henry M. Jackson</persName> (<gloss target="#t_D1">D</gloss>-WA), are not further identified.</note> including a
                        discussion of the viability of the weapons laboratories and of our
                        confidence in the status of weapons in stockpile.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> to comment on the parliamentary
                        situation in Geneva. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>
                        indicated that we probably should make a presentation of revised estimates
                        on detection and identification capabilities, but that for this session
                        perhaps no more would be needed; it would, of course, be desirable in
                        connection with the presentation of technical capabilities if there were
                        some feeling about the direction in which we might be moving with respect to
                        a comprehensive treaty. He indicated that difficulties in reaching agreement
                        on a non-proliferation agreement and in particular because of difficulties
                        on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, suggested that an extension of
                        the test ban looked increasingly like the most realistic way of actually
                        making progress in preventing nuclear proliferation. He then stated as an
                        issue whether or not the difficulties in a treaty along the lines favored by
                            <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                        <note n="6" xml:id="d93fn6">That is, one in which there would be an
                            understanding that failure to provide adequate assurances of compliance
                            through on-site inspection would be grounds for withdrawal. [Footnote in
                            the source text.]</note> would be balanced by the gains that might be
                        realized on the non-proliferation front. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked whether we could not achieve the
                        same objectives with respect to non-proliferation through the <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName> proposal.<note n="7" xml:id="d93fn7">In a statement to the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee in Geneva
                            on July 29, Italian Foreign Minister Amintore <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName> said: “It is quite conceivable that the
                            non-nuclear countries might agree to renounce unilaterally equipping
                            themselves with nuclear weapons for a specific length of time, it being
                            understood of course that if their aforementioned demands were not
                            complied with during that time limit, they would resume their freedom of
                            action.” The demands consisted of “having certain safeguards against
                            nuclear attack” and “some progress in the nuclear disarmament of the
                            nuclear countries.” (<hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1965</hi>, pp. 288-289)</note>
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> replied that that remained
                        to be seen, depending on the response of various non-nuclear powers, but
                        that he was not confident that the <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName> proposal would be acceptable to the nations about whom
                        we were most concerned. He then discussed briefly the three alternatives
                        that had been presented in <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> background
                            papers.<note n="8" xml:id="d93fn8">According to <persName corresp="#p_KSMJ1">Keeny</persName>'s August 24 memorandum to Bundy

                            meeting of the Committee of Principals, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> would present “the following four separate proposals for
                            consideration by the Principals: #1—The comprehensive ban with no
                            inspections except in connection with the withdrawal process. #2—An
                            uninspected partial ban with a threshold at Mag. 4.5. #3—a comprehensive
                            test ban with a reduced number of inspections. #4—An uninspected
                            threshold treaty that would become comprehensive without inspections
                            provided a sufficient number of states adhere to it.” (Johnson Library,

                            1 July 65-31 July)</note> With respect to continuing to insist on a
                        treaty <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0276"/>involving an explicit number
                        of on-site inspections he felt this was certainly a viable US position—but
                        one that could prove to have been unduly conservative if, by having stuck
                        with it, we would have been confronted a few years hence with a number of
                        new nuclear powers, a possibility which he felt a comprehensive treaty might
                        do much to head off. He conceded that the first <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> alternative, and for that matter the second as well (a
                        threshold treaty), would require such extensive discussion within the
                        Government that it would be totally unrealistic to expect any decision in
                        the context of the presently projected time scale for this session of the
                            <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In response to a query from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        observed that he felt that it was presently not the time for a new proposal
                        on the part of the US and that we would pay a heavy price for what would
                        ultimately not succeed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        indicated agreement with the qualification that this would be true, unless
                        of course, the Soviet Union should indicate—as they have not so far—some
                        willingness to move in our direction on the verification issue.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> indicated that six of the
                        non-aligned nations in Geneva have suggested going ahead with the threshold
                        treaty. He realized that such a treaty might in fact not prevent a
                        determined non-nuclear power from developing nuclear weapons while still
                        complying with the treaty but that the negotiation of such a treaty might
                        nevertheless have some useful political effect. The Vice President said he
                        felt such a treaty would be a mistake—that it would be an invitation to
                        acrimony and distrust.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> suggested that
                        perhaps the Soviet Union did not want an agreement of any kind at this time
                        in view of the Vietnam confrontation. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> concurred.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked whether there
                        would be difficulties on security grounds in making information available on
                        detection and identification. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Scoville</persName> indicated there would be some difficulty because of the
                        sensitivity of the <gloss target="#t_AEDS1">AEDS</gloss> system, but felt
                        that such problems could be dealt with.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> observed that he felt
                        that the estimates given by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FRA4">Frosch</persName> with respect to a system of <gloss target="#t_LASA1">LASA</gloss>'s were overly optimistic. For example, he said he was informed
                        that 16 and not 10 LASA's would be needed. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> doubted that a system of <gloss target="#t_LASA1">LASA</gloss>'s could be installed as quickly as had been estimated (in
                        from two or three years). Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> inquired as to the cost of the system. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FRA4">Frosch</persName> replied that it <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0277"/>would be about $250,000,000. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> observed that this price
                        would not be excessive if the projected capabilities would be realized, but
                        again expressed his doubts with regard to the estimates of projected
                        capabilities considering the data so far available from the system. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FRA4">Frosch</persName> said the prototype in
                        Montana was not operational yet, but that preliminary indications suggested
                        that it would be as good or better than had been estimated. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>, with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> concurring, advised conservatism in
                        the use of estimates on projected capabilities.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> indicated that he
                        concluded: (1) that the atmosphere was presently not encouraging for
                        agreement; (2) that there was no interest on the part of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in grappling with the problem of
                        verification; (3) that the briefing that he had just heard indicated that we
                        still had a verification problem to deal with; and (4) that he did not see
                        that it would be profitable to go through the major effort required in
                        modifying the US position, considering the benefits that could be obtained.
                        He suggested that for the present ENDC our position should remain basically
                        as it is, pending some indication of willingness from the Soviets to deal
                        with the verification problem, but that we should go ahead with technical
                        briefings at the ENDC. He suggested that our problem in connection with a
                        comprehensive treaty was not with such countries as Egypt, but was with the
                        Soviet Union. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> observed
                        that he felt our most immediate problem was with India. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> replied that he felt that the preferred
                        solution there would be along the lines suggested by <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName>. Mr. Bundy supported Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> in his contention that the major
                        immediate problem was India, but suggested that we really do not understand
                        what the Indian position is. He observed that we probably could modify our
                        position on the number of on-site inspections but thought that is a
                        US-Soviet problem that might be best dealt with other than in Geneva.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> raised the question as
                        to why, if it is desirable to stop nuclear proliferation, the non-nuclear
                        powers should not simply go ahead and get together to stop it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> observed that we cannot take the
                        position that nuclear proliferation is a matter of concern to the
                        non-nuclear powers alone. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested that perhaps a more effective way to prevent
                        India from going ahead with a nuclear weapons program would be to threaten
                        denial of US foreign aid. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>
                        remarked that we had been considering the advisability of a “Sense of the
                        Congress” resolution which would to some degree have had implicit in it such
                        a threat, but that there had been opposition from the State Department to
                        the use of such threats to discourage the Indians. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> argued for the necessity of our
                        taking leadership in attempting to prevent nuclear proliferation and
                        indicated the improbability of our being able to achieve the desired
                        objectives through a non-proliferation agreement, in the light of the
                        difficulties with the Germans regarding the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> pointed out that the difficulty was not
                        Germany, <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0278"/>but unwillingness on the
                        part of the Soviet Union to accept an agreement. In reply Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> cited the recent outburst by former
                        Chancellor Adenauer with reference to the Geneva negotiations. Mr. Bundy
                        replied that if the Soviets would accept reasonable language we could
                        certainly sign such a treaty despite Adenauer's opposition. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> continued, observing that the point
                        he was trying to make was that it seemed unlikely that we were going to get
                        a joint US-Soviet non-proliferation agreement very soon (though we could be
                        surprised by <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>'s response
                        next Tuesday) and that, therefore, perhaps we should emphasize other
                        approaches to non-proliferation.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> to draft some instructions along the
                        lines of the attached summary of conclusions and desired actions.<note n="9" xml:id="d93fn9">

                        information on detection and identification capabilities, Commissioner Tape
                        noted that we would be giving information on projected, rather than
                        presently reliable, capabilities. His view was supported by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then suggested that he
                        and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> should talk further
                        about whether and how there should be a review of our position on a
                        comprehensive treaty. We could not do this for the present <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>, but the problem would not die with that
                        session.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President observed that we ought not always to assume that we need
                        come up with a new position and that he did not necessarily agree that
                        because the Soviets have been recalcitrant with respect to verification we
                        should necessarily look for something new. He suggested their attitude could
                        change as it did abruptly in the case of the partial test ban treaty. He
                        indicated his support of the <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName>
                        idea, and he agreed that it would not be realistic to expect a new
                        Government position between now and September 9 (estimated date of
                        adjournment of the present <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>). He said
                        we ought not to include in any treaty those things that build distrust, and
                        suggested that a treaty that had no on-site inspections would suffer from
                        that defect. He also strongly opposed a threshold treaty for that reason,
                        and also because it did not do much toward preventing proliferation.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> observed that he felt
                        that not many countries were really very much interested in disarmament.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> suggested the
                        possibility, assuming neither China nor France would be a party to a treaty,
                        that some day political relations might even change so greatly that China
                        might conduct tests for the Soviets and the French might test US
                    devices.</p>

                        modifications in the U.S. position on a treaty prohibiting or limiting such

                    </p>
                    <p>(1) For the time being our basic position on a comprehensive nuclear test ban
                        treaty should not be changed. (In the context of the meeting it was clear
                        that it was not the Secretary's intention to preclude the possibility of the
                        number of inspections being reduced or the modalities of inspection changes
                        in the light of technical progress, but rather to indicate that we should
                        continue to hold that any new treaty or modification of the present treaty
                        would have to include provision in it for adequate verification.)</p>
                    <p>(2) We should welcome any indication from the Soviet Union of its willingness
                        to consider seriously a treaty in which there was adequate provision for
                        verification.</p>
                    <p>(3) We should indicate willingness to engage in technical discussion with the
                        Soviet Union on the question of detection and identification capabilities.</p>
                    <p>(4) We should be willing, to the extent that security considerations permit,
                        to make available to interested countries (presumably particularly at the
                            <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>) information on recent and
                        prospective progress in detecting and identifying seismic events.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested
                        that he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> get together
                        to explore what further steps should be taken over a longer (than <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>) time scale in reviewing the U.S.
                        position on a comprehensive test ban treaty.</p>

                    <p>In the light of my recent conversation with you I am attaching herewith for
                        your approval a position paper on the Latin American nuclear-free zone which
                        discusses at some length the relation of Cuba to the proposed zone.<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2">Not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The paper calls for me to urge the inclusion of Cuba, which is a sine qua non
                        for some other states in the area and which would involve Cuba's consent to
                        a multilateral verification system in place of our unilateral surveillance
                        to which it now objects; but the paper calls for us to support creation of
                        the zone even if Cuba ultimately refuses to join, since establishment of a
                        zone by other states would exert pressure on Cuba to <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0281"/>join it and since the zone would generally
                        be valuable in halting nuclear proliferation.</p>
                    <p>We will shortly be approached in New York by representatives of the Latin
                        American working groups on a nuclear-free zone, who are not perfectly
                        satisfied with the limited statements of our views that we have so far made
                        to them. Your approval of this paper will enable us to expand on those
                        statements.</p>

                    <p>Referring to their previous discussion of disarmament and a World Disarmament
                            Conference<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">A memorandum of their conversation
                            at Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s dinner for
                            Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            in New York, September 29, is in Department of State, Central Files, POL
                                US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then asked the Secretary if there
                        were any real possibilities of resolving some other matters during the
                        present <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> Session.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that while he did not now want to make an official
                        statement, he did want to express a few thoughts. One of the things that
                        particularly disturbed him in the Disarmament question was the fact that
                        countries other than the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        appeared to have very little interest in resolving Disarmament problems
                        among themselves. He recalled that at the very same moment, a few years ago,
                        when the General Assembly unanimously adopted a Resolution for General and
                        Complete Disarmament, some 70 countries were asking us for military
                        assistance and some 20 countries were asking the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for such aid. He noted an almost complete lack of effort
                        on the part of other countries in putting an end to the arms race in the
                        Near East, in Latin America and in other areas of the world. He was hopeful
                        that a limitation of armaments in other parts of the world would eventually
                        be achieved, but was struck by the others' great indifference towards this
                        problem. He had pointed this fact out to some other world leaders in private
                        discussions; it was clear to him that Disarmament was of primary interest to
                        the two great powers only. Did the Foreign Minister, for example, see any
                        possibility of discussing the level of armaments as between Israel and
                        Egypt; would he care to carry on a very private conversation concerning the
                        possibility of limiting the quantities of arms being supplied to other
                        nations by the US and by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated his views as to the
                        reason for other nations' lack of interest in Disarmament. He ascribed this
                        to the fact that while many good resolutions had been adopted in the past
                        and many fine speeches delivered, nothing much had been practically
                        accomplished. He was therefore not surprised at the fact that others had
                        little faith in the effectiveness of the various resolutions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we had, for example, tried to get Egypt and Israel to
                        accept the Vienna safeguards on atomic energy. We had spoken to
                        representatives of each country privately, but it was hard to get one to act
                        before the other, or even together. He thought that if the US and the Soviet
                        Union were to undertake joint efforts in this direction, it might prove to
                        be more encouraging to the countries involved.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that even if this
                        were so, it would still be difficult for the countries involved to reach the
                        proper decisions since they could see that at the same time everyone else
                        was continuing arms accumulation. <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0283"/>He made a distinction between the regional and the partial approach to
                        Disarmament. He did see merits in a partial approach provided it applied to
                        all the countries which were relevant to the problem. As to a regional
                        approach, what possibilities did the Secretary see in that?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> replied that the
                        regional approach might be effective for entire continents, such as Africa
                        and Latin America for example. He informed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that since their last conversation the Foreign
                        Minister of Mexico had informed him that he intended to discuss the question
                        of a nuclear-free Latin America with Cuba. He thought a similar approach
                        could be taken with reference to a nuclear-free Africa, provided Israel were
                        included in this region for this purpose, inasmuch as it would involve
                        Egypt. He also thought that the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could be of considerable assistance in pressing these
                        countries to agree to a renunciation of nuclear arms acquisition.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> informed the Secretary
                        that since their last conversation he had tried to ascertain if there were
                        any change in Cuba's attitude toward a nuclear-free Latin America, but that
                        he had not been able to detect any new elements in this attitude.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> recalled that the General
                        Assembly had adopted a resolution calling for nuclear-free Africa a few
                        years ago, with support of all the great powers.<note n="3" xml:id="d97fn3">Reference is to U.N. General Assembly Resolution 1652 (XVI), adopted
                            November 24, 1961; text in Yearbook of the United Nations, 1961, pp.
                            29-30.</note> Why should we not now take some steps in the direction of
                        giving judicial force to this resolution; he thought it would have a good
                        effect in improving the international atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agreed that we would be
                        interested in this undertaking. He wanted to talk to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> privately concerning a strong
                        effort to keep Cairo and Israel from going too far in the arms race, not
                        only in the nuclear field, but also in the matter of other sophisticated
                        weapons. He thought it might be possible to reach an informal understanding
                        to bring pressure to bear upon Israel and Egypt in this respect to limit
                        their arms buildup to certain levels; for the more sophisticated the weapons
                        at their disposal, the more trouble could be anticipated. The Secretary
                        cited the fact that just one squadron of supersonic planes involved costs
                        equal to those of building and maintaining an entire university.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> inquired as to the
                        possible reaction of the two countries.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary cited the suspicion and distrust between the two countries
                        involved; they were unwilling to reach any agreement with each other. He
                        could imagine that some day it might be possible for both the US and the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to jointly lay down the status quo
                        in the Near East—<pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0284"/>to say to the
                        countries involved “here are the borders, here is the settlement, and we
                        will not tolerate the use of force to resolve disputes in the Near East.” If
                        the Soviet Union and the United States both made it clear to these countries
                        that we would not accept force, we could establish a real peace in the Near
                        East, so that these countries would no longer be burdened by the arms race.
                        He realized that because of broader questions, there were some difficulties
                        now involved in joint action.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> inquired as to when this
                        could be brought about. He thought the great powers themselves should first
                        find a way to lessen their arms burdens. The Secretary replied that once we
                        agreed upon what the status quo in the Near East should be, we could make
                        such a policy effective.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> referred to the
                        proposal of diverting a quantity of fissionable material to peaceful uses,
                        which he had made in his <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> speech at the
                        suggestion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d97fn4">Reference is to the statement by U.S. Representative to
                            the United Nations, <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Arthur J.
                            Goldberg</persName>, to the U.N. General Assembly, September 23; text in
                            Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, October 11, 1965, pp. 578-587.</note>
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> remarked that the
                        procedure had not been made clear. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> said that while he had made the proposal
                        officially, it would be up to the experts to work out the details. He
                        pointed out that the diversion of necessity implied halting the further
                        production of nuclear materials, the transfer of some of the existing stocks
                        to peaceful uses and also the destruction of an appropriate amount of
                        nuclear weapon carriers, although this latter aspect would also of necessity
                        be limited. He assumed that both sides had more than enough weapons at
                        present.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> remarked that
                        before his country could agree to the transfer of 40 tons of U-235, the
                        major question of control, including control over industrial installations
                        would have to be resolved.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he did not
                        consider this proposal to be practical under present circumstances, in fact
                        he considered it to be impossible of implementation. Unavoidably this
                        proposal raised a number of other difficult questions of control; what was
                        to be the scope of control, its depth and techniques? In fact many of the
                        already familiar post World War II questions were being raised by this
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he wanted to ask a naive question. Was it possible that
                        the word “control” had somewhat different meanings in the two languages? To
                        us the word did not imply management, direction and the making of decisions.
                        The Secretary mentioned that there was a subtle difference between the
                        meanings of the word “control” as between the English and the French
                        languages; could it be possible that misunderstandings <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0285"/>arose because of a difference in meaning
                        between English and Russian?</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister did not attach any significance to the linguistic
                        problem. There was practically no difference in meaning. The very earliest
                        discussions on control had made it clear that the problem was not
                        linguistic, but rather fundamental. For this reason he again pointed out
                        that Ambassador Goldberg's proposal touched upon a great many difficult
                        problems. Under present circumstances he could see no possibilities of
                        getting it adopted. Still he thought it would be good if understanding on
                        other practical matters could be reached.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> remarked that the
                        amount of control required could be relatively small.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued his argument by
                        pointing out that in the event the proposed quantities of fissionable
                        material were diverted and such diversion verified, but due to the
                        impossibility of reaching an understanding on control production of new
                        nuclear weapons were to be continued, nothing would have been accomplished.
                        This proposal was similar to the proposal made by the US several years ago
                        regarding demolition of certain types of military planes. He did not think
                        that the security of his country and indeed that of the rest of the world
                        would have been enhanced by such demolition.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> thought that, on the
                        contrary, in his opinion both countries would have gained something by
                        carrying out the proposed plane demolitions. He reminded Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> of the fact that many weapons,
                        which were obsolete for the US and the USSR were not by any means obsolete
                        for other countries. It would be better to destroy them than to spread them
                        throughout the rest of the world. Both the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were often under great pressure to supply
                        other countries with supersonic aircraft which had become obsolete for them,
                        but were quite sophisticated for other countries. He therefore could see an
                        advantage in their destruction.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thought it would be
                        simpler not to furnish such aircraft to other countries, if we did not want
                        them to be spread throughout the world. The Secretary pointed out that this
                        question had not been thoroughly discussed and that there were some other
                        considerations. For example, if Egypt were furnished supersonic aircraft,
                        the Israelis would feel they too must have such planes, even though their
                        country was almost too small for a supersonic plane to turn around without
                        violating someone else's border; Israel would then proceed to acquire such
                        planes from France, for example. In other words, there was a certain
                        snowball effect in operation. Perhaps here was a subject—ceilings on
                        sophistication—on which the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        could reach an understanding. Did Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> think this might be possible, in view of the beneficial
                        effect this would have upon the budgets of other countries.</p>
                    <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0286"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> pointed out that the other
                        countries involved would inevitably point to the military budgets of the
                        great powers. He asked the Secretary if the United States estimated that
                        there is any real danger of other countries producing nuclear weapons, that
                        is countries which did not possess such weapons today. He meant not only
                        capabilities, but also intentions and practical steps.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said it might be useful to exchange impressions on this subject
                        with each other. He was prepared to do so in some detail. As to Egypt, at
                        present that country did not have the scientific, technical and industrial
                        capability of producing nuclear weapons. He thought that Israel did have
                        such capability in view of the advanced state of science and technology in
                        that country. For this reason we had insisted on inspecting their
                        installations periodically. While they were not at present engaged in the
                        production of nuclear weapons, they could do so in the future. As the
                        Secretary had mentioned in his last conversation with the Foreign Minister,
                        he thought Israel was “three months pregnant.” The Israelis had assured us
                        that they would not be the first country in the Near East to produce such
                        weapons. It was conceivable, however, that Israel would some day announce
                        that it had developed nuclear weapons, even without having first tested
                        them. We do observe their activities closely. Sweden has the capability of
                        producing nuclear weapons. At the time of signing of the Nuclear Test Ban
                        Treaty Sweden had reserved its right to withdraw from the Treaty in the
                        future if it thought its interests demanded such action. We do not believe,
                        however, that they are producing today. They could move rather quickly,
                        however. India probably had the necessary scientific and industrial base for
                        nuclear capability. The Chinese detonations provided a stimulus for India's
                        interest in the subject. Without pointing a finger at anyone, the Secretary
                        wanted to mention that we had been informed that some Indians felt that they
                        had been encouraged by some Soviets to develop nuclear weapons. Our policy
                        has consistently been to discourage this and the Secretary hoped that this
                        was the Soviet policy, as well. He did not believe Indonesia had any nuclear
                        capability; if an explosion did occur in that area, we must conclude that it
                        was of Chinese origin. The Secretary was not fully informed on what had
                        happened in Djakarta today, but he did think it possible that the Chinese
                        would detonate a nuclear bomb in Indonesia. As to Germany, it did possess
                        the necessary industrial and scientific base.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> interjected that the
                        Secretary must have meant the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. He
                        pointed out that there were two Germanys today.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary went on to say that he thought this was true of both Germanys.
                        But he could very frankly assure the Foreign Minister that this would not be
                        permitted to happen, as far as Western Germany was concerned, for if it did,
                        it would break up <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. We did not see any
                        political possibilities in this direction. These then were the key
                        countries. <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0287"/>For reasons of prestige
                        a few other countries had stated their reservations at the time of signing
                        the Test Ban Treaty, Brazil and Switzerland, for example. As to
                        Czechoslovakia, perhaps the Minister knew the situation there. This, then,
                        was the Secretary's assessment of the situation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thanked the Secretary for
                        the information. He said that he completely excluded the possibility that
                        anyone from the Soviet Union had advised India to develop nuclear weapons.
                        If such rumors were indeed current, he would think that they originated from
                        countries which had had relations with India, and perhaps also with the
                        Soviet Union. He did not think that the Secretary really believed such
                        rumors. Such action on the part of the Soviet Union would have been
                        completely contrary to its position on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
                        He thought that if the position of the US on proliferation was identical
                        with that of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, it would be best to
                        close all channels and all possible ways for other countries to acquire
                        nuclear weapons. He emphasized this point again with reference to an
                        international treaty on non-proliferation.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said in his opinion it was in the nature of nuclear weapons
                        themselves that the country, which possesses them is opposed to other
                        countries acquiring such weapons. As for the United States, we had thought
                        that even one nuclear power was one too many as evidenced by our position in
                        the Baruch Plan in the forties.<note n="5" xml:id="d97fn5">Reference is to
                            U.S. proposals for the international control of atomic energy made by
                            Bernard M. Baruch, U.S. Representative on the U.N. Atomic Energy
                            Commission, June 14, 1946. For text, see A Decade of American Foreign
                            Policy: Basic Documents, 1941-1949, pp. 865-871.</note> Certainly, two,
                        three, four or five were also too many. This is a Pandora's Box—we had tried
                        to close the lid. We therefore concluded that in this matter our positions
                        were identical. The Secretary appreciated the Minister's remarks about India
                        and accepted his statement. Recently we had heard the doctrine of
                        proliferation proclaimed from Peiping and Djakarta—statements to the effect
                        that other developing nations in Asia and Africa should be encouraged to
                        acquire nuclear weapons. The Secretary thought it would be useful to clear
                        the decks of lesser problems by putting together a draft of a
                        non-proliferation treaty containing provisions even now acceptable to both
                        sides, and then to see if the Minister's doubts of possible nuclear
                        arrangements in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> could be cleared away
                        in private discussions, before presenting a proposed treaty to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, a draft, in other words, agreed on all
                        points except Articles 1 and 2 of the Soviet draft. We could in this manner
                        get rid of the underbrush before proceeding to the trees.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> pointed out that in his
                        view these two articles contained the crucial provisions of an effective
                        treaty, but that he would leave this matter up to the Secretary. The
                        Secretary continued by saying <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0288"/>that
                        he had in mind an effort to reduce and clarify the issues. For example, how
                        many nuclear powers at a minimum would have to be a party to such a treaty;
                        we had already informed the Minister that we thought three powers to be
                        essential.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> appreciated the
                        Secretary's explanation, but he did see a real difference in the respective
                        positions on the crucial issue. [Here follows discussion of European
                        security.]</p>
                    <p>The Secretary was particularly interested in general disarmament. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> would notice this
                        clearly next January and February when the Budget is discussed in Congress.
                        We have embarked on a broad program of many social reforms; this means that
                        disarmament has become even more important to us than it was earlier, since
                        we want to be able to push more of our resources into taking better care of
                        our own people. The Secretary therefore could assure Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> of the seriousness of his interest.
                        While he could not speak for France, Great Britain or the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, he thought that perhaps there was some
                        advantage in private, quite informal and relaxed conversations without any
                        specific agenda. We would like to see some movement on these problems so as
                        to lighten the tremendous burdens borne by the two countries at present. We
                        would like to see a permanent settlement in Central Europe, which was fully
                        guaranteed by the Soviet Union and the United States, so as to preclude the
                        possibility of war.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> noted that the Secretary
                        had several times referred to military budgets; he concluded that this was
                        of major importance to the US; why not then consider once again the
                        possibilities of reducing military budgets?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out that our two countries were not the only ones
                        involved. We had recently heard some references to the advantages of a
                        foreign policy conducted by the end of a rifle barrel—they come from another
                        part of the world. There was no point in discussing budget reductions with
                        the Soviet Union, to include reductions in the military budget of the
                        country from where these statements came, since the Soviet Union could not
                        deliver. We were of course referring to Peiping.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> inquired if we would not
                        agree that the US was far more powerful than China. The Secretary replied
                        that in general this was of course true. However, we did have a specific
                        problem on the ground, which had cost us a lot of money—Southeast Asia. We
                        would have much preferred to use this money for peaceful development of many
                        areas of the world, including North Vietnam, as the President had stated in
                        his Baltimore speech.<note n="6" xml:id="d97fn6">Reference is to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s address at Johns

                    </p>
                    <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0289"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that the sooner
                        the Southeast Asia situation was normalized, the better. In a sense he could
                        see that the US Government was rather pessimistic regarding disarmament,
                        reduction of military budgets and a secure European settlement. He recalled
                        that President Roosevelt had once said we had nothing to fear but fear
                        itself. He wondered whether our pessimism in itself did not now constitute a
                        serious obstacle.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary had two comments to make, one of which did not involve the
                        Soviet Union and another, which did. In the largest historical and
                        geographical sense the US had a compelling interest in peace in the Atlantic
                        and Pacific. During World War II we had agreed with the Soviet Union that
                        our first priority was the defeat of Hitler, but he wanted to remind the
                        Minister that the second priority had involved a very large military effort.
                        Therefore the portion of our present defense budget which pertains to the
                        Pacific does not involve the Soviet Union. If Peiping pursued a policy of
                        peaceful coexistence, this would be a different matter, but we are now
                        unable to agree with the Soviet Union on reducing our defense budget without
                        regard to events in the Pacific and without regard to the policies of
                        Peiping. The other problem is one in which the Minister could make a
                        contribution. We realize that when we ask the Soviet Union for verification
                        and control, we are asking the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to make
                        a unilateral concession; this is due to the nature of our open society.
                        Verification, control and information needs of the Soviet Union are answered
                        by the very fact that our society is open to the extent of 97 percent of
                        these needs. An additional 2 percent are contributed by the fact that people
                        in our government cannot keep their mouths shut. The final 1 percent is
                        accounted for by Soviet espionage, so that there is nothing unknown about us
                        to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. It is quite a different matter
                        in the opposite direction. The General Staff of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> considers secrecy to be a strategic weapon, and people in
                        the Soviet government do know how to keep their mouths shut. As a result, it
                        is exceedingly difficult to gather intelligence about the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Secretary suggested that the Foreign
                        Minister appoint someone in the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs to study
                        ways of how the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could provide us with
                        the necessary assurances on verification, etc. The Minister should not ask
                        us to accept this on good faith. It was too soon to expect us to rely on
                        good faith alone—we did need verification, inspection and other assurance.
                        The Secretary wanted to leave this problem with the Minister. We are not
                        trying to pry or control; all we needed was to find some basis of confidence
                        that when we sign an agreement, the result will be what we anticipated when
                        we signed it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> referred to the
                        Secretary's references to the policies of China. Did he not think that to a
                        great extent these policies were merely a reaction to the policies of the
                        United States in the Pacific? He, the Minister, <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0290"/>was sure this was the case. Another thing was the
                        Secretary's reference to confidence and mutual trust. A minimum of these
                        between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were
                        essential—i.e. a minimum of trust which was not the result of physical
                        checkups, control and verification. For example, in the handling of the
                        Nuclear Test Ban Treaty confidence and trust were most important. The
                        Minister thought the Secretary had confidence in the Soviet Union's
                        observance of its provisions and he, for his part, did not believe we were
                        violating the Treaty. He wanted to take up the possibility of extending the
                        Treaty to underground tests as well. A like attitude of trust and confidence
                        would be needed, for example, to implement nuclear-free zones in Africa,
                        Europe and other parts of the world. He did not think that control in itself
                        was an absolute. It related to the specifics of each situation and he did
                        not think this question had been sufficiently explored in relation to
                        specific measures.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> replied that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s comment about Chinese
                        policy being a reaction to US policy might be a possible explanation if only
                        Washington had trouble with Peiping. But, there was also trouble between
                        Peiping and Moscow. Ten days ago we had held our 127th meeting with Peiping
                        in Warsaw. For the 127th time Peiping had rejected any kind of discussions
                        with us unless we first were prepared to surrender Formosa. We replied we
                        could not surrender 11 million people. If we were to offer recognition to
                        Peiping tomorrow morning, without Formosa, they would say no. As concerns
                        verification—our need for this is easily explained by the differences in our
                        political system: we must be able to assure our own people that we are
                        confident that certain things are or are not happening. In the case of the
                        Nuclear Test Ban Treaty extending to underground tests, we are certain that
                        someone will say “those damned Russians are cheating.” We have to be able to
                        say to them: “No, we are sure of our own knowledge that they are not.” From
                        our point of view this question of verification is solely a matter of
                        technology. Our policy will follow scientific and technical capabilities in
                        this field. They have been and will be increasing, but they are not as yet
                        adequate to place us in a position to extend the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to
                        underground testing without verification. For this reason we would be very
                        glad to have American and Soviet scientists cooperate on improving the
                        applicable technology.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> added that with
                        reference to underground testing he had stated that our position was
                        flexible and that we had therefore invited Soviet representatives to come
                        and see our latest scientific advances in detection, which made it possible
                        to distinguish earthquakes from other explosions within a certain range.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary inquired of the Minister whether he had understood the Soviet
                        position with reference to underground testing correctly, that is that test
                        of a level of 4.75 and above to be added to the Nuclear Test Ban <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0291"/>Treaty and that a moratorium without time
                        limitation be placed upon tests below the threshold. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that the proposal mentioned
                        in his <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> speech<note n="7" xml:id="d97fn7">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s address to the U.N. General Assembly, September

                        originally made by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> representative in
                        the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>.<note n="8" xml:id="d97fn8">Reference is to the statement by Abdel F. Hassan, United Arab Republic
                            Representative to the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee, August 17,
                            1965. (Ibid., pp. 340-347)</note> To a further question he replied that
                        the two were of necessity connected. The Secretary stated that we could not
                        agree to a moratorium below the threshold. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thought that if anyone would benefit by such a
                        moratorium, it would be the United States, because it had a number of bases
                        on the territory of countries surrounding the Soviet Union, from which any
                        violation of the moratorium could be detected—for example Japan and other
                        countries. The Soviet Union had no such possibilities, hence the moratorium
                        could still be verified by the US.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out that when we spoke of national capabilities, we
                        were in fact talking of “international capabilities.” These facilities were
                        provided by other countries and if we were to lose some of them our
                        capabilities would be accordingly reduced.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> suggested that the
                        proposed treaty could include a provision like that in the present Test Ban
                        Treaty, which would make it possible for any signatory state to withdraw if
                        it considered that its highest interests required it to do so. He did not
                        want the Secretary to think that the Soviet Union's interest in this
                        proposed treaty was any greater than that of the US. If we could not reach
                        an understanding, we could go on as before. The reason that he could not
                        separate the moratorium provision from the threshold band was that other
                        nations would minimize the importance of the treaty if below threshold tests
                        were to be continued. The nature of observance of the moratorium would be
                        similar to that of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. A certain amount of trust
                        and confidence was needed and unavoidable.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that we were not concerned over the existing Nuclear
                        Test Ban, since we could assure our people that it was being observed. But,
                        if all testing were to be banned, the element of assurance would become
                        extremely important.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> remarked that a
                        separation of the two provisions could lead to arguments, such as 4.6 versus
                        4.75.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary repeated that assurance for our people was indispensable and
                        that we had no reason or intention to be picayune about the magnitude of an
                        explosion.</p>
                    <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0292"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> suggested his comment
                        about FDR's statement on fear be reexamined. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FNT1">Fedorenko</persName> remarked that they were ready to
                        trust us, but that we evidently were not ready to trust them.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary ended the discussion by saying that we needed something to
                        eliminate some of the fear, so that we could tell our people to relax.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed between the Secretary and the Minister to tell the press that
                        they had discussed problems of European security and United Nations
                        problems, including disarmament.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Treaty, the substance of which is contained in Articles I and II, clearly
                        rules out the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and would also appear to
                        rule out existing bilateral <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        arrangements. Note particularly the use of the extremely restrictive phrase,
                        “participate in … use of nuclear weapons,” in Articles I and II. Unless
                        there were a clear understanding to the contrary, I would interpret this
                        language to prohibit our existing <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        arrangements. <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0293"/>This has always been
                        the point that has worried me as lying behind our debate with the Soviets on
                        the MLF and a non-proliferation Treaty.</p>
                    <p>The question now is whether the Soviets have tabled this draft to answer
                        criticism that they have not been forthcoming with specific proposals and
                        will insist on the details of their draft, or whether the Soviets are simply
                        trying to get a good bargaining position for future negotiations on a
                        Treaty. For example, they might eventually propose to give up the language
                        outlawing our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> arrangements if we were
                        prepared to give up the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. Only time will

                    </list>
                    <p>The Secretary suggested that <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Lord
                        Chalfont</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>
                        exchange views in advance of the meeting on October 14. <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Lord Chalfont</persName>
                        <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0294"/>asked whether there was any
                        possibility of going further in linking a reduction of war heads with a
                        freeze. The Secretary replied that there would be if we were engaged in
                        serious discussions with the Russians. The trouble is that we have continued
                        to make concession after concession with no response from the Soviet Union.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said that
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had not been encouraging
                        on the subject of the arms race in the Near East but appeared to want to
                        keep the matter open. The Foreign Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had not discussed the Near East arms problem with
                        him but had raised the question of denuclearizing Africa.</p>
                    <p>On the matter of extending the test ban treaty the Secretary said the
                        Russians insisted on linking the threshold concept with a moratorium on all
                        other tests. He said that this amounted to an unverified test ban and was
                        unacceptable. The U.S. had proposed technical talks on detection systems.
                        But <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> took the position that
                        there could be no inspection for political reasons, and therefore it was
                        unnecessary to hold technical talks on the effectiveness of detecting
                        systems. The Soviets had also been unwilling to talk about the comparability
                        of defense budgets. The Secretary said that progress by mutual example in
                        budget reductions had been interrupted because Peiping had entered the
                        picture in South East Asia. Nevertheless we are seriously interested in
                        disarmament and a mutual understanding of defense budgets in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the U.S. would be helpful. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed with this. He
                        pointed out that the U.S. had made some defense budget cuts which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> didn't understand because they weren't
                        familiar with our complex defense budget system. A full understanding by
                        both governments of the other's defense budget could well lead to practical
                        results in mutual reductions in defense expenditures.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> raised the question of our
                        attitude toward a World Disarmament Conference. We see no merit in the idea
                        but the problem is how to deal with it in the General Assembly. <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Lord Chalfont</persName> agreed that a World Conference
                        could not be an effective forum for negotiations. In view of broad world
                        support for it, however, it would be best to avoid appearing to oppose it
                        while allowing the obvious difficulties in sponsorship etc. to arise without
                        helping to solve them. <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Lord Chalfont</persName>
                        said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had made it clear
                        the conference should be outside the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
                        should take place by the middle of next year. The Secretary agreed that no
                        good could come from such a conference. He added that it would cause great
                        difficulties with Germany and could endanger the work of the Committee of
                        18.</p>

                    <p>The Ambassador said he had been instructed to make the following statement:</p>
                    <p>“The contents of talks which recently took place between you, Mr. Secretary,
                        and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Minister for Foreign Affairs,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">A.A. Gromyko</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d100fn2">
                            <ref target="#d97">Document 97</ref>.</note> were carefully examined in
                        Moscow. During these talks positions of both sides were stated and explained
                        with regard to major international problems and questions of bilateral
                        relations between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the US.</p>
                    <p>“Now we would like to dwell on the question which, in our view, is not only
                        one of the most urgent but appears to be more than other questions ripe for
                        constructive discussion.</p>
                    <p>“Proper attention was given in Moscow to your words that the U.S. Government
                        and personally President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> most
                        seriously view the question of nondissemination of nuclear weapons and that
                        the US is anxious to see to it that nuclear weapons would not come into
                        possession of countries which do not have such weapons now.</p>
                    <p>“However, we cannot but feel concerned that while the consideration of the
                        question of preventing dissemination of nuclear weapons has reached the
                        stage of discussion of concrete drafts of an appropriate international
                        agreement, there have been reactivated efforts leading in the opposite
                        direction, towards drafting plans for the creation of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear force.</p>
                    <p>“Our position on this question is absolutely clear: we are against any forms
                        and means of dissemination of nuclear weapons, we stand for true and
                        immediate efforts to solve the problem of nondissemination. In no way can we
                        be blamed for taking any steps which even with a most fault-finding approach
                        would look like disseminating nuclear weapons. The <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0296"/>Soviet Union is ready to conclude a treaty
                        on nondissemination of nuclear weapons. We strive for an agreement on an
                        equal basis and seek no special purposes except a firm international
                        understanding to the effect that nuclear weapons should really be not
                        disseminated. If one evaluates the state of affairs objectively, the United
                        States should be no less interested in such an understanding than the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>“In this connection we have to emphasize once again that the plans for
                        creating a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear force are the main
                        obstacle in the way of concluding an agreement on nondissemination of
                        nuclear weapons. While explaining the position for the U.S. Government with
                        regard to the plans for creating a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        nuclear force you have repeatedly stated—and you did so, too, in recent
                        talks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">A.A. Gromyko</persName>—that the
                        United States considers these plans as a means of preventing the emergence
                        of a national nuclear force in West Germany. Yet, the fact remains: the
                        realization of these plans would not keep West Germany further away from but
                        bring it closer to nuclear weapons. This would mean dissemination of nuclear
                        weapons by bringing them within the reach of precisely those forces which
                        have twice in our time plunged Europe and the whole world into bloody wars.</p>
                    <p>“No one should ignore the experience of history and forget what attempts to
                        satisfy revanchist claims of German militarism through one concession after
                        another led to in the past. We would like to stress once again that plans to
                        create a multilateral nuclear force or other similar plans to bring nuclear
                        weapons within the reach of West Germany constitute a problem which directly
                        concerns the interests of security of the USSR and states friendly to us. It
                        goes without saying that in that case the Soviet Union and its Allies would
                        take measures to safeguard their security. But implementation of such plans
                        would exclude the possibility of concluding a treaty to ban the spread of
                        nuclear weapons. Such an action would considerably aggravate the situation
                        in Europe and throughout the world, it would greatly damage Soviet-American
                        relations, the state of which, even without this leaves much to be desired.</p>
                    <p>“Now the moment has come when it is necessary to make up one's mind, to make
                        a choice. If the United States intends, one way or another, to put into
                        effect the plan to create a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear
                        force, any negotiations on the problem of preventing spread of nuclear
                        weapons become devoid of sense and are doomed to failure in advance. But if
                        the U.S. is really willing to prevent further spread of nuclear weapons, it
                        would be possible to start without delay business-like negotiations aimed at
                        working out a mutually acceptable text of a treaty on nondissemination of
                        nuclear weapons. For our part, we are ready for such talks.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary stated he would wish to study the statement in detail, but it
                        did not appear to him that the statement represented any movement in the
                        substance of the question. He said it appeared to him that the Soviet
                        Government was raising obstacles without knowing what the problem really was
                        as they could not know the details of any nuclear arrangements since these
                        had not been worked out. He also observed that it was not clear whether the
                        Soviet draft of a non-proliferation treaty excluded existing <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> arrangements.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that if existing
                        arrangements provided for nuclear proliferation, that the Soviet Union was
                        against them. He said, however, that the Soviet Union was ready to discuss
                        their draft treaty article-by-article. The Secretary said that in
                        conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> appeared to make a
                        distinction between delivery vehicles and weapons.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that this
                        matter could be looked at and the text of an agreement could be discussed.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that one thing that struck him was that the Soviets seemed
                        to be nervous about their security with regard to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear arrangements that were more secure and more safe
                        than existing arrangements.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> observed that this was a
                        matter of judgment.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he was being driven to the conclusion that there was
                        something in the Soviet minds other than proliferation. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> repeated that the Soviets were
                        prepared to discuss both the American and the Soviet drafts.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary concluded by stating that he would wish to study the Soviet
                        message but, at first glance, his impression was that it had not changed the

                    </list>
                    <p>The following is in reply to your inquiry at the Nov. 4 Staff Meeting:<note n="2" xml:id="d101fn2">Not found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>To date the Soviet position on what forms of nuclear sharing might be
                        permitted under a non-proliferation treaty remains unclear. Indeed, in the
                        course of US-Soviet bilateral talks on their respective draft treaties, the
                        Soviets have introduced new uncertainties rather than clarified specific
                        issues. It thus appears that by deferring any final definition of an
                        acceptable formula for nuclear sharing and still allowing for the conclusion
                        of a treaty, the Soviet Union hopes to retain a focus on its objections to
                        nuclear sharing in the broadest sense. Moscow apparently hopes to exert
                        pressure on the U.S. and possibly other Western governments on the eve of
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s visit to the United States and the
                        forth-coming <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Defense Ministers'
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>This suggests that while wishing to keep the focus on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> the Soviets may desire to leave open the option either of
                        retaining some element of potential flexibility on nuclear sharing, or
                        conversely, of challenging present <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        nuclear arrangements should they consider this expedient. The Soviets may
                        have had the latter alternative in mind when on September 24 they proffered
                        their draft treaty at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The language of
                        the draft not only ruled out <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, but could
                        have been read as prohibiting a Special Committee, existing nuclear
                        arrangements in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and perhaps even some
                        in the Warsaw Pact itself. (The Soviets could, however, interpret this
                        language in such a way as to use it against the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Stockpile without incurring similar penalties.)</p>
                    <p>Subsequent conversations with Soviet officials conveyed an impression of a
                        degree of possible flexibility on the subject of existing arrangements in
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. That the Soviets might not be
                        unalterably opposed to such arrangements was implicit in Soviet Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>'s remark to <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> October 20 to the effect that the Soviet objections
                        were not directed at the deployment of nuclear weapons by the United States
                        in Europe. Pressing him further, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said that <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0299"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>'s statement seemed to
                        clarify matters on this point, but <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> remained silent.</p>
                    <p>The issue of nuclear sharing also arose in the course of your talks with
                        Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin on October 29.<note n="3" xml:id="d101fn3">See
                                <ref target="#d100">Document 100</ref>.</note> In emphasizing the
                        futility of negotiations in the face of efforts to create an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> did not raise the idea of a Special Committee but
                        merely referred to Soviet opposition to “any forms and means of
                        dissemination” and to the plans for a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        nuclear force “or other similar plans” to bring nuclear weapons “within
                        reach of West Germany.” Though reluctant to talk about existing
                        arrangements, he did state that if such arrangements provided for
                        proliferation then the Soviet Union was against them. Thus, he again left
                        open Moscow's appraisal of whether a Special Committee or existing
                        arrangements fit the Soviet structures or as something to be decided later.</p>
                    <p>The sum and substance of official talks with the Soviets, leaving aside the
                        more casual encounters with officers of the Soviet Embassy, is that on the
                        one hand the Soviets first stated that they oppose “new proliferation” only,
                        and that if future plans do not contemplate such new proliferation or new
                        access to nuclear weapons, the Soviets would not object; on the other hand
                        most recently they have taken a harder line across the board, indicating
                        that they would find unacceptable any arrangement providing for, or even
                        implying, a form of sharing or participation by non-nuclear parties in
                        policy determination regarding the use of nuclear weapons.</p>

                    <p rend="center">With Ambassador Dobrynin</p>
                    <p rend="center">Wednesday, November 24</p>
                    <p rend="center">1-3 p.m.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and I had the most
                        candid and cordial conversation of our three-year acquaintance today. In
                        approximate order of importance, the topics we discussed are as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. European nuclear arrangements. The Ambassador raised this subject toward
                        the end of the lunch—which is where he has usually raised the thing most on
                        his mind in our past talks.</p>
                    <p>The moment he raised the question, I told him that I was troubled by the lack
                        of clarity in the Soviet position on <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and other arrangements. Sometimes
                        the Soviet Union seemed to be saying to us that it was only the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> that was objectionable. At other times
                        Soviet representatives seemed to be hostile to all possible arrangements,
                        even those for simple consultation.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador parried by saying that the Soviet Union had a hard time
                        telling just what we had in mind. He said that he had been unable to satisfy
                        repeated requests from his government for an accurate account of purposes
                        and meaning of the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> special
                        committee (even his <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> colleagues in
                        Washington had told him that they honestly did not know what it was all
                        about). The Ambassador said that it would be easier for the Soviet Union to
                        comment on our policy if it knew exactly what that policy was. He said that
                        he knew there was a difference of opinion within the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> as between believers in collective weapons systems and
                        believers in consultation. He said that he had the impression that there was
                        not a firm decision in the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and he
                        implied that the Soviet Union could not express a fully defined position
                        until it knew what it had to deal with on our side.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out to the Ambassador that this position in turn created
                        difficulties in Washington. We were determined to move ahead with necessary
                        defensive arrangements, while at the same time we worked for the cause of
                        non-proliferation. The Ambassador was certainly correct in believing that
                        different kinds of arrangements were preferred by different groups here, but
                        I pointed out that as long as it appeared that the Soviet Union was equally
                        opposed to all arrangements, it would be hard for anyone in this government
                        to believe the choice we made would have any effect on relations with the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0302"/>
                    <p>The Ambassador said very earnestly that he understood this point and that for
                        this reason it would be of the greatest value to the Soviet Government if he
                        could have a wholly private and informal indication of the real plans and
                        preferences of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> as soon as they might
                        be decided. He was sure that such a private indication of our position would
                        be helpful, almost no matter what it was. The Ambassador cited as an example
                        the announcement today of a 700-man reduction in our forces in Berlin. He
                        thought that 24 hours private notice of this decision would have been most
                        helpful in Moscow.</p>
                    <p>I told the Ambassador that I understood the value of private communication.
                        The Ambassador, on his part, assured me that the Soviet Union would have no
                        interest whatever in using any such private communication to undermine our
                        relations with the Germans—he said that he thought we worry too much about
                        that, and that this simply was not the framework within which these matters
                        were reviewed within the Soviet Government. The Soviet Government's concern
                        about the Germans was real and deep, as he had told me often before. The
                        Ambassador remarked that he had often been told by his friends in the State
                        Department that Soviet protests in the nuclear field were merely another
                        example of the Soviet hostility toward <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and that he wanted me to understand that this was not the
                        case. Of course, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was not a Soviet
                        favorite, but the problem of nuclear proliferation and Germany was far
                        different and much more serious. On non-proliferation, he added, the Soviet
                        Government had exposed itself to severe criticism from quarters he need not
                        name (I inferred China); that should prove its sincerity.</p>
                    <p>I told the Ambassador that we understood the Soviet concern with Germany and
                        that indeed we shared it. I told him that I could give him categorical
                        assurance that there was no one in the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        who had the smallest intention of allowing the Germans to have national
                        control of nuclear weapons, and no one who would support the Germans in any
                        effort to use any German nuclear role as an instrument of pressure against
                        the Soviet Union. The Ambassador indicated that he believed me, but he made
                        it equally plain that his confidence was not shared in Moscow.</p>
                    <p>My own private and personal conclusion from this extended exchange, the
                        flavor of which I have not fully recaptured, is that we may well be able to
                        win Soviet acceptance of any nuclear arrangement in the West which does not
                        involve an immediate decision to build a new weapons system like the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, and which clearly avoids any increase in
                        direct German access to the nuclear trigger. I believe that both the
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> committee and the
                        revised <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> now under discussion could meet
                        this condition. I believe that Dobrynin is right and serious in his emphasis
                        upon the value of early private communication with the Soviet Government
                        when we know our mind in this matter.</p>
                    <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0303"/>
                    <p>Since in fact no one now wants the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, I
                        think we may well be able to make some money with Moscow if we tell them
                        privately before we sink it publicly.</p>
                    <p>In sum, I believe that what <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        said on this subject may open the way for us to meet our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> responsibilities and move at the same
                        time toward an agreement on non-proliferation. At the very least, the
                        Ambassador's position seems to me to reinforce the importance of the
                        President's stated view that we should approach the problem of Atlantic

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Dear <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName>:</p>
                    <p>The Chiefs have reported to me their objection to a statement you made a few
                        weeks ago that the Canal Zone will be included in any nuclear free zone. I
                        understand that this statement, reported in <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> cable 1926 to State,<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">Not printed.
                            (Department of State, Central Files, DEF 18-9 <gloss target="#t_LA1">LA</gloss>)</note> was based on an <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> policy paper which was approved by State but which was not
                        reviewed by the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d103fn3">
                            <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> paper is not further
                        identified.</note> While I realize that current negotiations with the
                        Panamanians may result in significant changes in the status of the Canal
                        Zone, such policy has yet to be approved and in any case such negotiations
                        have not been completed. <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0304"/>Therefore,
                        I would urge you not to make any further statements that the Canal Zone will
                        be included. It seems to me that if we are asked our position on this
                        matter, it would be appropriate to reply that pending the outcome of the
                        current negotiations between the Panamian Government and the United States,
                        it does not appear appropriate for the U.S. to take a position on this
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>The Chiefs also object to your statements concerning the inclusion of
                        Guantanamo in a nuclear free zone if Cuba were also included. As long as the
                        Latin Americans continue to assure our air and sea transit rights, I do not
                        believe such a commitment, however unlikely, would affect our security.
                        Furthermore, I understand it is very unlikely that Cuba will join a nuclear
                        free zone. Therefore, our position appears to be based primarily on
                        political considerations. In order not to give Castro an excuse for failing
                        to participate, I would be willing to support the inclusion of Guantanamo in
                        a Latin American nuclear free zone if and only if Cuba is also a member of
                        the zone.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the Chiefs have informed me that they consider it essential that
                        they be consulted in the formulation of any inspection plan since such a
                        plan might affect the current surveillance of the Cuban area. I agree with
                        the Chiefs on this issue and trust that you will provide us an opportunity
                        to review such a plan.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                    <p>The Secretary said he wished to make the following oral communication in
                        reply to the oral remarks which the Ambassador had made to him on the
                        subject of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons:</p>
                    <p>“The United States Government has carefully examined the oral statement made
                        by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on October 29,
                            1965.<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">
                            <ref target="#d100">Document 100</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>“The United States Government agrees with the Soviet Government's view that
                        the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. have a mutual interest in reaching an agreement to
                        prevent the dissemination of nuclear weapons. We also agree that this is one
                        of the most urgent problems and that it is ripe for constructive discussion.
                        Finally, we agree that the objective should be that nuclear weapons really
                        not be disseminated. As a recently-adopted General Assembly resolution which
                        we both supported declares: 'The treaty should be void of any loopholes
                        which might permit nuclear or non-nuclear Powers to proliferate, directly or
                        indirectly, nuclear weapons in any form.'<note n="3" xml:id="d104fn3">For
                            text of U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2028 (XX), adopted November 19,
                            1965, see <hi rend="italic">Yearbook of the United Nations, 1965</hi>,
                            pp. 72-73.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>“We must point out, however, that as long as the Soviet Union had hundreds of
                        intermediate and medium range nuclear missiles aimed at the territories of
                        our allies in Europe, our allies are naturally going to desire participation
                        in their defense against possible nuclear attack, but without the
                        proliferation of nuclear weapons. For this reason, no non-proliferation
                        treaty which, in addition to barring proliferation, also bars such
                        participation will be acceptable to the United States. We have no intention
                        of signing any agreement which would preclude our allies from participating
                        in their own defense, so long as such participation does not involve
                        proliferation.</p>
                    <p>“We have assured your Government in the past that no proposals for the
                        defense of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations which we have
                        supported would produce proliferation. Our proposals are, on the contrary,
                        designed to prevent it. If, as your statement indicates, you do not accept
                        this conclusion and believe such arrangements could in the future lead to
                        proliferation, then you should join us in negotiating a treaty to prevent
                        proliferation from taking place in any manner.</p>
                    <p>“The United States is prepared to negotiate a treaty, such as the United
                        States draft, which bars dissemination in any form, directly or
                            indirectly.<note n="4" xml:id="d104fn4">For text of the U.S. Draft

                            on Disarmament, 1965, pp. 347-349.</note> We are prepared to agree that
                        no non-nuclear country acquires nuclear weapons, rational control over
                        nuclear weapons, the power itself to fire nuclear weapons, or information on
                        how to manufacture <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0306"/>nuclear weapons.
                        We are prepared to agree that these things should not be done directly or
                        indirectly, through third States or groups of States, or through units of
                        the armed forces or military personnel of States, even if such units or
                        personnel are under the command of a military alliance. Finally, to close
                        any conceivable loophole that might otherwise remain, we are prepared to ban
                        any action which would cause an increase in the total number of entities
                        having independent power to use nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>“We believe this to be a reasonable basis upon which a treaty could be
                        negotiated, assuming the Soviet Government is interested in such a treaty.
                        We believe it possible to proceed with negotiations promptly, in New York,
                        in Geneva or elsewhere. To expedite those negotiations, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested, and Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agreed, that a beginning
                        be made with the articles of the two draft treaties upon which agreement
                        appears to be close, and such talks have begun.</p>
                    <p>“The United States Government continues to attach the greatest importance to
                        achieving progress on the problem of proliferation, and is ready for
                        constructive discussions to this end.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary added that if the concern of the Soviet side was proliferation,
                        we should be able to reach agreement. We are not, and never have been,
                        thinking about proliferation. We were as opposed to this as the Soviets for
                        many of the same reasons. On the other hand, if the Soviet objection was
                        based on the fact that they did not like <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, we could not help them. The Secretary said he had not seen
                        the British Foreign Minister yet to see if he has had any further

                        confined themselves to criticizing our draft but they had put in one of
                        their own, to which there was some opposition in Moscow, in an effort to get
                        a solution. They would be prepared to sign tomorrow if the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> issue could be cleared up. He pointed out

                        what we were really planning.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he had told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        that neither he nor we knew what an eventual arrangement might be.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the Germans were now
                        thinking of medium-range missiles. He had discussed this with members of the
                        German Embassy here, who were quite frank about it and they were equally
                        frank in Bonn. He said the Soviets believe that the future of Europe lay in
                        reconciliation. Many Germans, and this had been particularly the case during
                        the time of Adenauer and Dulles, believed that by creating military power of
                        their own, they could get East Germany back. Some of them seemed to think
                        they could exploit Soviet difficulties with China. We were making one
                        concession after another to the West Germans.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said these questions did not arise in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> until the Soviets created this enormous nuclear force,
                        targeted on Germany. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
                        that we had moved first in this matter and had put our missiles in Germany
                        and then the Soviets had reacted. The Secretary said we took seriously the
                        matter that the Soviet Union and we had heavy responsibility for peace. We
                        were not trying to mislead the Soviets on non-proliferation, and could not
                        do so in any event. The Soviets, in fact, sat at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> table on these discussions but when we
                        ask about the Warsaw Pact we get no answer.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> rejoined that the Poles had
                        given the Secretary a clear answer by saying they had not asked for nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>At this point the conversation turned to other subjects.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>In response to the Negotiating Committee's request to me on October 26, the
                        following points reflect the attitude of the United States towards the
                        establishment of a nuclear free zone in Latin America.</p>
                    <p>The United States supports the creation of nuclear free zones such as a Latin
                        American nuclear free zone, where the initiative for such zones originates
                        within the area concerned; where the zone includes all states in the area
                        whose participation is deemed important; where the creation of a zone would
                        not disturb necessary security arrangements; and where provisions are
                        included for following up on alleged violations in order to give reasonable
                        assurance of compliance with the zone. An effective agreement based on these
                        principals, which were presented by US representatives at the Eighteenth
                        Session of the General Assembly and reaffirmed by the United States at the
                        United Nations Disarmament Commission earlier this year, would complement
                        efforts to achieve the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>As recently as November 22, 1965, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> stated before the Second Special
                        Inter-American Conference at Rio de Janeiro the following:</p>
                    <p>“The United States has followed with keen and sympathetic interest the
                        efforts of Latin American countries to work out agreed arrangements for
                        excluding the proliferation, the stationing, or storage of nuclear weapons
                        within the territory of Latin American States. We have noted the encouraging
                        progress toward this end which was made during the current year at
                        discussions in Mexico City. The United States believes the project of a
                        nuclear free zone in Latin America is constructive statesmanship in the best
                        tradition of the Hemisphere. We welcome the effort and would be glad to see
                        it reach a successful conclusion.”<note n="2" xml:id="d105fn2">For complete

                    </p>
                    <p>We are aware that the governments of Latin America are now considering
                        certain aspects of the proposed zone in preparation for additional meetings
                        of the Preparatory Commission and its committees. Our <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0309"/>final position, of course, will have to
                        await decisions on the nature and scope of the zone.</p>
                    <p>We do not wish to have included in the proposed nuclear free zone the Virgin
                        Islands, since it is United States territory, or the Commonwealth of Puerto
                        Rico, because of its integral relationship with the United States. In the
                        case of both these areas, the United States must deal with disarmament
                        policies affecting other nuclear powers. From the US point of view, we would
                        be agreeable to inclusion of the Panama Canal Zone, although of course the
                        well-established transit rights would not be affected by the establishment
                        of the proposed nuclear free zone. We could also agree to include Guantanamo
                        if Cuba participates.<note n="3" xml:id="d105fn3">See <ref target="#d103fn1">footnote 1, Document 103</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The United States believes it important that all states in the area should
                        participate. The refusal of certain states to participate would lead us to
                        consider whether their exclusion might render the agreement ineffective or
                        meaningless, or whether the agreement would still be worthwhile.</p>
                    <p>The United States heartily approves the proposal of the Preparatory
                        Commission to apply <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards to all
                        Latin American nuclear activities, which would permit verification against
                        the diversion of peaceful activities to weapons development. For
                        verification against the introduction of nuclear weapons, we believe that
                        other procedures would have to be considered. The United States understands
                        that such other procedures are under consideration by Governments
                        participating in the Preparatory Commission.</p>
                    <p>In the hope that the governments of Latin America can successfully achieve a
                        viable and workable nuclear free zone, the United States welcomes
                        opportunities to exchange views with the representatives of the Preparatory
                        Commission and the governments of Latin America.</p>

                    <p>2008. 1. Following is distillation of remarks on nuclear-sharing problem
                        which were interspersed in my conversation last night with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> (Embtel 2000)<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">Not printed. (Ibid., POL US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note> on general state of our relations.</p>
                    <p>2. Leaving question of Vietnam which we had been discussing, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he wished to address question
                        of proliferation of nuclear weapons. Soviet Government believed, he said,
                        that it was not too late to remedy this situation. In common with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                        other countries, we should not allow nuclear weapons to spread. Time would
                        come when we too might regret our current policy. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was resolutely opposed to <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s access to nuclear weapons in any form, but believed this to
                        be not just in Soviet interest but in interest of all major powers.
                        Referring to his statement to recent meeting of Supreme Soviet,<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3">Reference presumably is to Soviet Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s address of December
                            9 before the Supreme Soviet. Extracts are printed in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1965</hi>, pp. 454-456
                            and 494-497.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said Soviets believed that
                        door to solution of this problem was not yet closed and they would not like
                        to see it closed. It seemed to him that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> should now address himself with
                        greater sympathy to their position on non-dissemination.</p>
                    <p>3. I said that I had always felt our interests were basically the same on
                        non-proliferation, and I referred him to communique issued at end of
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> visit which I thought
                        served interest of non-proliferation.<note n="4" xml:id="d106fn4">Chancellor

                            with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, Secretary

                            officials on December 20-21. The joint statement issued following
                            discussions with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> is in <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the

                        I made point again that Soviets should understand interest of peoples, who
                        had missiles targeted against them, in sharing in their own defense. I was
                        glad to hear him say that door was still open, and I hoped we could make
                        progress when the meetings in Geneva resumed. Our view was the same, I
                        repeated, on point of not allowing additional political entities to gain
                        control over nuclear weapons. Our differences related to means of
                        accomplishing this purpose.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> responded by warning that
                        if by any chance we reached agreement with <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on access, including access on “political plane,” to questions
                        relating to use of nuclear weapons, that would close door to agreement on
                        non-proliferation and Soviets would have to take <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0311"/>necessary steps looking to their own security and that of
                        their allies. In meantime, reports had appeared, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said, that de facto decisions had been taken to give
                        access to Germans “on political plane.” If this were so, truth would [come]
                        out sooner or later and this would eliminate possibility of
                        non-proliferation agreement.</p>
                    <p>5. I pointed out that this got down to question of definition, and asked
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to clarify whether in his
                        remarks on this subject to Supreme Soviet he had been referring to present
                        arrangements. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that
                        what he was talking about was the nuclear committee idea, which they
                        considered unacceptable. For the Germans to take part in preparation of
                        nuclear strategy would, he said, be considered access. When I remonstrated
                        that this had nothing to do with access, he insisted that “if a country has
                        a means of taking part in decisions on use of nuclear weapons, this is
                        access.”</p>
                    <p>6. I said I believed we were following more realistic policy on this matter
                        than they were. If a country, whether it was a member of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or the Warsaw Pact, had hundreds of
                        missiles trained upon it as Soviet leaders had publicly said was case with
                        respect to <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, wasn't effect of this to
                        exert pressure on them to secure their own in absence other defense
                        arrangements? If Soviet Government was going so far as to consider that
                        political consultation constituted “access,” they were putting tremendous
                        pressure on a country to get its own weapons. While Soviets focused on
                        Germany, it seemed to me that Soviet position barring political consultation
                        had still broader implications for countries like India which had nuclear
                        capability plus a hostile neighbor on its border. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> protested that this was introducing
                        unrelated question.</p>
                    <p>7. I told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that I appreciated
                        his willingness to discuss these issues frankly with me, and that I would
                        carefully report his remarks.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> called, at his
                        request, on the Acting Secretary. He said he wished to present a personal
                        message from his Prime Minister to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> on the subject of non-proliferation.<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2">
                            <ref target="#d108">Document 108</ref>.</note> The Ambassador noted that
                        the message was confidential and that it was being handled in the same way
                        as previous confidential communications between Soviet leaders and the
                        President. Although the original text in Russian was not signed, the
                        Ambassador reiterated that the message was from the Soviet Prime Minister.
                        He handed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> an unofficial
                        translation in English of the Prime Minister's message.</p>
                    <p>After reading the message, the Acting Secretary said that it would be
                        transmitted to the President at once and that a reply would be prepared.</p>
                    <p>The Acting Secretary commented that we have a difference of view with the
                        Soviet Government with regard to what we consider as the same purpose,
                        namely, that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should play a
                        constructive role in Europe and not a destructive one. In this connection,
                        our stand is conditioned by the effects of efforts in the past to stabilize
                        the situation in Europe. If we are to prevent developments which could lead
                        in the direction of destroying Europe, we must make it possible for
                        non-nuclear powers to exercise some influence in the control of nuclear
                        weapons. Otherwise, the energies of these powers might be channeled in
                        harmful directions.</p>
                    <p>The Acting Secretary said that he was sure this line of argumentation was
                        familiar to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and
                        he regretted that we have not been able to persuade the Soviet Government of
                        the correctness of our views. The Acting Secretary emphasized that we do not
                        envisage a situation where a German Government would have the possibility of
                        making an independent decision to detonate nuclear weapons. We see three
                        alternatives in regard to the control of nuclear weapons:</p>
                    <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0313"/>
                    <p>1. Attempt to maintain a situation where the powerful nations already
                        possessing nuclear weapons do not share their nuclear power with others and
                        keep non-nuclear countries in a state of permanent inferiority.</p>
                    <p>2. Allow countries not having nuclear weapons to develop nuclear capability
                        on an independent, national basis. We consider this a disastrous course.</p>
                    <p>3. Establish a collective arrangement where control over nuclear weapons
                        would be shared and no new independent capabilities would be created. We
                        feel that this offers the best prospects.</p>
                    <p>The Acting Secretary said that we are very sincere in desiring
                        non-proliferation and that we have given great thought to our policy in this
                        regard. He did not know if it would be possible to reconcile the United
                        States and Soviet views but he assured the Ambassador that the Soviet
                        message would be studied carefully.</p>

                        SOVIET AMBASSADOR DOBRYNIN</p>
                    <p rend="center">January 11, 1966, 6 p.m.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Dear Mr. President.</p>
                    <p>We have decided to address this communication to you in order to set forth
                        our views on a question, the urgency of which is recognized by everybody.
                        This question is the problem of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons which
                        has been discussed for a long time on a bilateral basis and at international
                        conferences, but the solution of which has not progressed so far.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government, as you undoubtedly know, attaches great significance
                        to the program of preventing the dissemination of nuclear weapons. We
                        believe that if the dissemination of these terrible weapons <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0314"/>of mass destruction is not blocked and
                        these weapons continue to spread more and more throughout the world, that
                        would inevitably lead to the growth of the threat of war and would
                        immeasurably increase the danger of the outbreak of a nuclear war. Having in
                        mind the importance of this problem the Soviet Government submitted it for
                        consideration by the twentieth session of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly, by introducing a draft treaty on
                        non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>We are aware of the official position of your Government on this question. We
                        have taken note of the statement of the U.S. Government, transmitted on
                        December 8, 1965, through Dobrynin, the Soviet Ambassador in Washington,
                        that it is interested in reaching an agreement on non-dissemination of
                        nuclear weapons and that “the objective (of such an agreement) should be
                        that nuclear weapons really not be disseminated.”<note n="2" xml:id="d108fn2">
                            <ref target="#d104">Document 104</ref>.</note> We also note that the
                        U.S. Government agreed that such a treaty, as set forth in the General
                        Assembly resolution of November 19, 1965, adopted at its twentieth session,
                        “should be void of any loopholes which might permit nuclear or non-nuclear
                        powers to proliferate, directly or indirectly, nuclear weapons in any
                            form.”<note n="3" xml:id="d108fn3">Reference is to U.N. General Assembly
                            Resolution 2028 (XX), adopted November 19, 1965. (Yearbook of the United
                            Nations, 1965, p. 73)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>If one proceeds from these statements it would not seem to be very difficult
                        to work out a mutually acceptable text of a non-proliferation treaty.
                        Unfortunately, this is not the case. The American draft treaty and even more
                        steps actually taken by the U.S.A. indicate that the Governments of our
                        countries by no means give the same content to the very notion of
                        “non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.”</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government has in mind such a treaty which would really exclude
                        the possibility of any dissemination of nuclear weapons whatever which would
                        make it impossible for non-nuclear powers to acquire access to these weapons
                        in any form, directly or indirectly.</p>
                    <p>As for the Government of the U.S.A., our understanding is that while
                        declaring its readiness to reach an agreement on non-proliferation of
                        nuclear weapons, it has in mind an agreement which would provide a
                        significant exception to the principle of non-proliferation by permitting
                        the implementation of plans, now under discussion within the framework of
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, for providing access to nuclear
                        weapons to the non-nuclear member states of this military alliance,
                        including West Germany. It is precisely this that is the main difference
                        between the positions of the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. on the question of the
                        non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government has frequently drawn the attention of the U.S.
                        Government to the fact that statements on striving to prevent <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0315"/>dissemination of nuclear weapons are in no
                        way compatible with actions actually leading to the spread of such weapons.
                        We have invariably emphasized, since we have most weighty reasons for doing
                        so, that what is especially dangerous is a policy of satisfying step by step
                        the nuclear claims of the Bonn Government, creating thereby conditions which
                        make it easier for the West German revanchists to get access to nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, it is a fact that the U.S.A. on an evergrowing scale provides the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies with atomic information. It is a
                        fact that the U.S.A. trains military personnel of those countries in the
                        methods of using nuclear weapons. It is a fact that the U.S.A. provides some
                        of its allies, including the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> with the
                        very weapons which are capable of carrying nuclear shells, although it
                        declares at the same time that the nuclear warheads for such weapons remain
                        under the control of the U.S. Moreover, as it was recently reported in the
                        Western press, American nuclear warheads are now not only assigned to the
                        armed forces of several non-nuclear member-states of NATO and deployed on
                        their territories but in some cases West German planes and missiles manned
                        by West German military personnel are even equipped with these nuclear
                        warheads.</p>
                    <p>There are going on in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and at bilateral
                        meetings of representatives of Western powers active discussions of various
                        plans, the essence of which, no matter what might be said, is only one
                        thing: how and to what extent to satisfy the growing nuclear demands of West
                        Germany. A new concession to West Germany which creates obstacles on the
                        road to the solution of the problem of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons
                        was the proposal providing for the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s
                        participation in decisions on the question of nuclear strategy in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> within the framework of the so-called
                            “<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> committee.”<note n="4" xml:id="d108fn4">Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested the establishment of a select
                            committee of four or five members reportedly including France, the
                            United Kingdom, the United States, and West Germany to study ways of
                            extending nuclear weapons planning and consultation at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Defense Ministers Meeting in Paris

                            November 27, 1965, for this purpose. It set up three working groups
                            concerned with communications, data exchange, and nuclear planning under
                            the guidance of a steering committee consisting of the Permanent
                            Representatives of the participating countries. See Department of State
                                <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, June 21, 1965, p. 993, and December 13, 1965, p. 939.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>And today the Bonn Government is now putting forward new claims and is
                        getting ready to demand even more tomorrow. The final goal pursued by the
                        West German Government is obvious, although it tries meanwhile to camouflage
                        it, is the possession of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Frequent attempts have been made to convince us that West Germany allegedly
                        has no such goals and its access to nuclear weapons is not <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0316"/>involved. But what is left of these
                        assurances if the Defense Minister of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> von Hassel openly states that West Germany will not be
                        satisfied until it possesses atomic weapons, and other Bonn leaders now
                        publicly say that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will not sign a
                        non-proliferation agreement if it blocks the creation of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear force.</p>
                    <p>Thus, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Government in effect challenges
                        the whole world, the United Nations, which called for earliest conclusion of
                        a treaty to prevent dissemination of nuclear weapons. And how can one
                        evaluate statements by the head of the West German Government that during
                        his recent visit to the U.S.A. he received not only a promise to provide

                        be given priority over the question of the conclusion of a non-proliferation
                        treaty?</p>
                    <p>These statements by leaders of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        Government were not refuted by the American side although their meaning is
                        at variance with the position of the U.S. Government as it was stated to us
                        in the communication of December 8 and earlier statements made to us by
                        official representatives of the U.S.A. Moreover, the Western press has
                        carried a report that the United States indeed gives priority to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear plans in the belief that the
                        non-proliferation agreement can wait, since even if these plans should be
                        resolved, the Soviet Union allegedly would not abandon its position on
                        non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>In connection with such baseless speculations we deem it necessary to
                        emphasize once again that no matter what intentions the United States and
                        other Western powers may have in connection with those plans now under
                        discussion in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, the Soviet Union will
                        never agree that West Germany should acquire access to nuclear weapons in
                        any form whatsoever. No matter how one evaluates the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s policy,—we know that your assessment of this policy
                        differs from ours,—one thing is clear: the access of West Germany to nuclear
                        weapons would create a direct threat to European states and would cause a
                        new, sharp aggravation of the whole international situation.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government has already unequivocally stated that if the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> got access to nuclear weapons either
                        through a multilateral or an Atlantic nuclear force, on the basis of
                        creating some “atomic committee” or in any other form, the Soviet Union
                        would be forced to take all measures which it, along with its allies and
                        friends, would consider necessary for securing peace in Europe. This is a
                        question of the vital interests of the <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0317"/>Soviet Union, and we not only have the right but believe it
                        to be our duty—this stems from the Potsdam agreements as well—to prevent
                        West Germany from becoming the source of a new war.</p>
                    <p>Now, Mr. President, the moment has come, when it is necessary to make a
                        definite choice: either we shall firmly adhere to the position of
                        non-proliferation of nuclear weapons without any deviations from this
                        position or the situation will inevitably lead to proliferation of nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>It is said that this whole question is still under consideration by your
                        Government and that final decision has not yet been made. We would like to
                        believe that this is so. Knowing that the decisive word on this rests with
                        you, we hope that you will personally devote the most searching attention to
                        this question.</p>
                    <p>The problem of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is so important that it
                        is necessary once again to weigh with utmost responsibility all possible
                        consequences of the decision to be made. It would be a mistake in this
                        matter to try to derive some unilateral advantages. A non-proliferation
                        agreement must meet in equal measure the interests of all countries and all
                        peoples.</p>
                    <p>For its part, the Soviet Government, consistently standing for the prevention
                        of proliferation of nuclear weapons, is ready to begin businesslike
                        negotiations to prepare such a non-proliferation treaty. Taking into account
                        the considerations put forward by the American side in the statement of
                        December 8, we propose that during the forthcoming session of the 18-Nation
                        Disarmament Committee in Geneva, along with the discussions of the question
                        of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the Committee itself,
                        representatives of the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. carry on a bilateral exchange
                        of views in order to expedite the working out of an appropriate draft
                        treaty.</p>

                    <p>3. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> memorandum proposes that, at the resumption of the
                        Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Conference (<gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>) on 27 January <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0319"/>1966,
                        the United States attempt to negotiate a <gloss target="#t_CTBT1">CTBT</gloss>. In the event that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        is unwilling to permit the on-site verification necessary for a <gloss target="#t_CTBT1">CTBT</gloss>, the United States should then propose an
                        extension of the present Limited Test Ban Treaty (<gloss target="#t_LTBT1">LTBT</gloss>) to underground tests with a seismic threshold of 4.75
                        without inspections. The views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as expressed in
                        the foregoing references concerning a <gloss target="#t_CTBT1">CTBT</gloss>
                        remain valid and the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that a <gloss target="#t_CTBT1">CTBT</gloss> would prejudice the national security
                        interests of the United States at this time. The views concerning a 4.75
                            <gloss target="#t_TTBT1">TTBT</gloss> follow.</p>
                    <p>4. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> memorandum assumes that the United States could verify a
                        threshold test ban using its existing national system and would rely heavily
                        on unilateral US intelligence to identify suspicious events. The Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff, as well as the United States Intelligence Board (<gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss>),<note n="7" xml:id="d109fn7">TCS
                                3236/65/<gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_D1">D</gloss>-32/12/3; available in SAO channels. [Footnote in the
                            source text.]</note> have consistently stated that US intelligence
                        capabilities should not be used as a primary means of verification of any
                        arms control measure. Seismology, at best, can identify some seismic events
                        as earthquakes; it cannot now identify seismic events as nuclear
                        detonations. For these reasons the Joint Chiefs of Staff reiterate their
                        position that a separate means of verification, including on-site
                        inspections, should be established and in operation on the effective date of
                        implementation of any such proposal.</p>
                    <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that
                        there will be inadvertent violations of such a treaty and many suspected
                        violations because of the uncertainties and possible ambiguities associated
                        with monitoring. For this reason, they believe that such a treaty may well
                        create more suspicion than it dispels and may increase international
                        distrust.</p>
                    <p>6. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider
                        that the effects of a <gloss target="#t_TTBT1">TTBT</gloss> upon the
                        strategic nuclear balance may be sufficient to justify rejection of the
                            <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal. The United States must
                        approach any nuclear test ban from a position of strength. Although it may
                        be accepted that the United States enjoys a favorable strategic position,
                        this advantage is threatened by the deployment of a Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. To counter this threat, the United
                        States must develop its own <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system, must
                        remove known vulnerabilities in US strategic missile systems, and must
                        develop an advanced re-entry system, such as Multiple Individually-targeted
                        Re-entry Vehicles (<gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s). To realize these
                        goals, tests beyond those permitted by the proposed test ban are required.
                            [<hi rend="italic">2-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>7. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) While <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> acknowledges the importance of a hot X-ray <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system, the argument set forth by <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> appears to be that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> does not possess the needed know-how to
                        exploit this potential capability and that further restriction, at this
                        time, could freeze the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0320"/>and US <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> race. The <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> statement, “there
                        is no evidence that [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] is not sufficient assurance in this case. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has had the opportunity to discover this
                        and other effects under the present treaty as well as in their 1961/1962
                        high-altitude, high-yield tests. These latter tests might also have
                        uncovered effects we know nothing about. We cannot assume that the USSR
                        knows less than the United States about these effects.</p>
                    <p>8. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize that
                        there may be political advantages to the United States signing a <gloss target="#t_TTBT1">TTBT</gloss>, such as a limited impact on
                        proliferation. However, there are important political disadvantages which,
                        with the military disadvantages, are overriding in the view of the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff. They concur with the consensus of the Committee of
                        Principals in the 25 August 1965 meeting in which it was noted that the
                        imprecision inherent in monitoring such a treaty may lead to disputes,
                        suspicion, acrimony, and distrust.</p>
                    <p>9. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) On balance, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        believe that the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal would
                        prejudice the security interest of the United States. Specifically, the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff are opposed to a threshold treaty as proposed because:</p>
                    <p>a. There are no provisions for policing a <gloss target="#t_TTBT1">TTBT</gloss> effectively.</p>
                    <p>b. Primary responsibility for verifying compliance with a <gloss target="#t_TTBT1">TTBT</gloss> would have to rest with Atomic Energy
                        Detection System and US intelligence. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as
                            <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss>, believe that these sources should
                        not be relied upon for verification nor should they be so employed.</p>
                    <p>c. The inexactitudes of the science of seismology, as it applies to nuclear
                        detonations, preclude a definite and unarguable policing of a <gloss target="#t_TTBT1">TTBT</gloss>. Such a treaty may lead to disputes,
                        suspicion, acrimony, and distrust.</p>
                    <p>d. The <gloss target="#t_TTBT1">TTBT</gloss> would prevent the development of
                        high-yield area defense <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems, as well
                        as advanced re-entry warheads.</p>
                    <p>e. A <gloss target="#t_TTBT1">TTBT</gloss> would prevent rectification of
                        serious vulnerabilities in existing US ballistic missile forces.</p>
                    <p>f. A <gloss target="#t_TTBT1">TTBT</gloss> would have a debilitating impact
                        on the ability of the United States to maintain a competence in nuclear
                        weapons technology.</p>
                    <p>10. (<gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>) The <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> memorandum states that a modalities paper for on-site
                        inspection will be circulated for comment at staff level. The Joint Chiefs
                        of Staff reaffirm their desire to make recommendations on any on-site
                        inspection procedures prior to their being discussed, in public or in

                    <p>In responding to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> request for an
                        analysis of the technical aspects of nuclear test ban proposals, the Panel
                        has focused upon the effects which either a Comprehensive Test Ban or a 4.75
                        Threshold Ban would have upon the keystone of US National defense: the
                        strategic deterrent. Three areas of critical vulnerabilities, which if
                        exploited by the Soviet Union would seriously compromise our deterrent, have
                        been discussed in the context of the underground nuclear tests required for
                        their correction. Upon examining the capability of the Soviets to exploit
                        these vulnerabilities the Panel concluded that</p>
                    <p>We have no evidence whether or not the Soviets have already achieved the
                        necessary nuclear developments, but if not, even a comprehensive ban could
                        not prevent their acquisition.</p>
                    <p>To maintain our deterrent, our best course is to pursue with all vigor the
                        programs now in progress for eradicating these vulnerabilities. Many of
                        these programs involve underground nuclear experiments. The Panel therefore
                        further concluded that</p>
                    <p>From the standpoint of our current and planned military-technical programs
                        the present is a particularly disadvantageous time for the US to enter into
                        a Comprehensive Test Ban Agreement.</p>
                    <p>Looking forward to the future and the obvious continued need for a high level
                        of competence in nuclear technology to maintain our deterrent, we see as one
                        of our greatest potential losses that</p>
                    <p>Under a comprehensive test ban our scientific and technical competence in
                        nuclear weapons design and in weapons effects would deteriorate
                        substantially in about three years and be seriously degraded in ten.</p>

                    <p>Turning to proliferation, which has been advanced as one of the principal
                        motivations for extending the Limited Treaty, we find that</p>
                    <p>On a purely technical basis, for a country bent on becoming a nuclear power,
                        the lack of testing would inhibit the development of thermonuclear weapons
                            <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0322"/>and light-weight fission
                        weapons, but could not prevent the development of primitive but effective
                        fission weapons.</p>
                    <p>After a section dealing in some detail with what might be done if a Treaty
                        extension appears inevitable, the report attempts to answer the four

                        attempt to negotiate a <gloss target="#t_CTBT1">CTBT</gloss>, providing for
                        an unspecified number of on-site inspections. The number of inspections
                        would be subject to negotiation but would have to be sufficient to give
                        confidence that the treaty was being observed. On-site inspections would be
                        conducted in accordance with a modalities paper prepared by <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>. In the event that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were unwilling to permit the on-site

                    <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) There are serious gaps in hard US
                        intelligence about the state of Soviet research in the newest weapon effects
                        areas known to US scientists. However, there are indications that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> already may have made important gains in
                        nuclear weapons technology beyond US capabilities, which could alter the
                        military balance. Such gains may have occurred in their knowledge of weapon
                        effects causing communications and radar blackout; they also may include
                        advances in the area of enhanced gamma, cold, and hot X-rays for
                        antiballistic missile (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>) and offensive
                        applications. This technology may introduce important vulnerabilities in the
                        US strategic missile systems.</p>
                    <p>6. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) It is believed that the Soviets have
                        begun to deploy an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense; however, it
                        has not yet been determined whether the defense will be an area or terminal
                        system, or a combination of both. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system capitalizing on
                        advanced nuclear technology (which the Soviets may possess), combined with
                        improvements in strategic weapon design and potential counterforce actions
                        which exploit US vulnerabilities, could upset the nuclear balance in favor
                        of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. To counter this threat, the
                        United States must develop its own <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        system, must remove known vulnerabilities in US strategic missile systems,
                        and must develop an advanced reentry system. These <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0324"/>developments require vigorous nuclear
                        testing which can be accomplished within <gloss target="#t_LTBT1">LTBT</gloss> restrictions.</p>
                    <p>7. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) It is important, from the standpoint
                        of ability to monitor a <gloss target="#t_CTBT1">CTBT</gloss>, to assess
                        whether there is a minimum yield below which crucial military gains could
                        not occur through clandestine testing. [<hi rend="italic">3-1/2 lines of
                            source text are not declassified</hi>] Vigorous exploitation of low
                        yield (less than 1 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss>) techniques as a sole
                        means of weapons development, if successful, could lead to important
                        technical gains conceivably capable of changing the nuclear balance. As a
                        practical matter, the yield below which crucial military gains could not
                        occur through nuclear testing is unknown.</p>
                    <p>8. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The current US Atomic Energy Detection
                        System can, with acceptable confidence, detect nuclear explosions in most
                        environments at thresholds of approximately 10 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss> in the Northern Hemisphere and as high as 100 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss> in the Southern Hemisphere. If current
                        improvement plans prove out, a reasonable capability can be expected in 2 to
                        3 years to detect signals from a 5 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss> nuclear
                        test in almost all environments in the Northern Hemisphere and 60 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss> in the Southern Hemisphere. Testing below
                        these levels may go undetected, and, with decoupling and evasion techniques,
                        tests well above these yields may also go undetected.</p>
                    <p>9. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) In summary, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        oppose a CTBT as not in the security interest of the United States. The
                        United States must approach any nuclear test ban from a position of
                        strength. Although it may be accepted that the United States enjoys a
                        favorable strategic position, this advantage is threatened by the probable
                        deployment of a Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system and the
                        important advances that the Soviets have probably made in weapons effects
                        technology. To counter this threat, the United States must develop its own
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system and must remove
                        vulnerabilities in US strategic missile systems. To realize these goals,
                        substantial underground testing is required. Additionally, verification
                        procedures in being and projected are insufficient to insure that under a
                            <gloss target="#t_CTBT1">CTBT</gloss> the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could not conduct sufficient tests to achieve important
                        advances in nuclear technology. The Joint Chiefs of Staff desire to make
                        recommendations on proposed on-site inspection procedures prior to their
                        being discussed, in public or in private, with foreign governments.</p>

                    <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Chalfont</persName> considered that inability
                        to make headway on a non-proliferation treaty at Geneva would make some
                        movement toward a test ban desirable. The Canadians shared this view. A
                        comprehensive test ban would also contribute to non-proliferation
                        objectives. The U.K. considered that as a result of progress in seismic
                        detection the risks involved in a comprehensive test ban without on-sites
                        were so small as to be politically acceptable. The U.K. would, however,
                        continue publicly to support the U.S. position, despite growing pressures at
                        home. Lord <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Chalfont</persName> asked whether the
                        U.S. saw any possibility of a comprehensive test ban without on-sites. If
                        not, perhaps further thought might be given to suggestions for an
                        international “detection club” or to the concept of “challenge inspections”
                        suggested in the ICY report.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said that at this time
                        there was no possibility of the U.S. abandoning its insistence on on-sites.
                        “Challenge inspections” would introduce elements of such great instability
                        as to make any test ban concluded on these bases less than useful. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said that consideration
                        was still continuing within the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> of a
                        half-a-loaf approach, including a threshold test ban. He did not feel that
                        there was much basis for optimism as to the results of our consideration,
                        however. In any event, the U.S. remained firmly opposed to any linking of a
                        threshold ban and a moratorium. The U.S. had devoted considerable research
                        to ways of simplifying on-site modalities and making them less intrusive,
                        and it was not impossible that at some stage the Soviets might return to
                        accepting some form of on-sites.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> elaborated further on the
                        subject of “challenge inspections.” He doubted whether they would have a
                        strong deterrent effect against violation. If, as the ICY report admits, it
                        was unlikely that the <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0326"/>Soviets would
                        admit inspectors into their territory anyway in response to a “challenge,”
                        it hardly seemed just that the onus for initiating withdrawal from the test
                        ban would have to fall on the innocent party. A test ban based on “challenge
                        inspections” would also have considerable de-stablizing effect in US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> bilateral relationship. Referring to
                        studies on a threshold test ban, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> said on a personal basis that three main problems seemed
                        to be involved: a) whether a threshold ban would have practical value if the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and countries such as India could
                        still test under the threshold; b) whether it might seriously inhibit
                        countries from going nuclear; and c) to what extent it would prevent us from
                        doing what we want to do. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>
                        asked for U.K. views on the possible inhibiting effect on non-nuclear states
                        of a threshold test ban or even of the offer of such a test ban. In short,
                        would it be worthwhile even to propose one?</p>
                    <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Chalfont</persName> replied that in his
                        opinion a threshold test ban would not have much concrete effect; its real
                        value would be mainly tactical. However, the whole question of acceptability
                        of a test ban seemed to be viewed on the U.S. side in absolute terms. The
                        U.K. considered that the danger of breach of agreement on extension of the
                        limited test ban to all tests was very small, since seismic capabilities
                        were now so highly developed that a country would have to go to great
                        lengths to conceal even very small underground tests. He realized that there
                        were political factors that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had to
                        take into account. A more important question, however, was whether the U.S.
                        was able to give up underground testing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> replied that he did not believe the U.S. could agree
                        to cease underground testing unless the broader implications for other areas
                        of some Soviet acceptance of the principle of verification made it
                        worthwhile. However, for us to accept a cessation of underground testing
                        without obtaining any change in the Soviet position on inspection would
                        simply generate mistrust and suspicion of possible violation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> recalled the atmosphere that had
                        prevailed during the moratorium.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAW1">Barber</persName>, describing <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>'s interim conclusions on the effects in the
                        bilateral US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> context, of cessation of
                        underground testing, said that the U.S. would not be able positively to
                        identify some 4-6 Soviet underground tests if they were to be conducted
                        elsewhere than at presently known Soviet test sites. While the number of
                        tests would be small, what was significant was that the few tests of these
                        yields conducted in the U.S. test program had been very important for <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> warhead development. The question,
                        therefore, was whether the U.S. could risk an agreement under which the
                        Soviets might carry out such tests to their military advantage.</p>
                    <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Chalfont</persName> said the basic question
                        was whether it was likely the Soviets would sign a test ban if they intended
                        to violate it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> noted that
                        our open society was incapable of the kind of secrecy that the <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0327"/>Soviets could maintain, so that we could
                        safely proceed only on the basis of what we could find out through
                        verification.</p>
                    <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Chalfont</persName> said that he was quite
                        content to wait and see whether some movement might be possible on the U.S.
                        side. A threshold test ban at magnitude 4.75 would be valuable for tactical
                        and presentational reasons and could have some significance for
                        non-proliferation.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harold Beeley<note n="3" xml:id="d112fn3">Deputy Head of the British
                            Delegation to the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee.</note>
                        commented that the U.K. saw some advantage in “challenge inspections.”
                        Acceptance of this concept by the Soviets would involve admission by them
                        that the only way of proving innocence is by on-site inspection. He thought
                        that this would be a valuable gain for the West. Furthermore, he thought
                        that if a challenge inspection were refused, it would be relatively easy to
                        fix odium for the withdrawal on the adversary. Sir Harold further suggested
                        that it might be possible to combine a threshold test ban with challenge
                        inspections. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said that we
                        would want to give study to Sir Harold's suggestion.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harold also thought that a threshold test ban might be strengthened if it
                        were indicated that in time the seismic threshold could perhaps be lowered.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAW1">Barber</persName> asked whether this would
                        really be negotiable or was simply a suggestion as to possible tactics. Sir
                        Harold replied that otherwise it might be difficult to defend a threshold
                        ban offer against the argument that if it was possible to lower the
                        threshold this far then why not all the way, that is, to zero.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said that we would give
                        careful consideration to the British views. The test ban question could be
                        discussed further by the Western Four in Paris, and it was also certain to
                        come up at the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting.</p>
                    <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Chalfont</persName> concluded that it would
                        be very helpful to the U.K. if the U.S. could come forward at Geneva with a
                        proposal of this sort (i.e., threshold test ban), since the British
                        government was under some pressure at home to give up demands for on-site
                        inspection.</p>

                            Foster</persName>, Director, Arms Control and Disarmament Agency<note n="3" xml:id="d114fn3">Not found.</note>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. The paper used as a point of discussion for the meeting was the draft of
                        the proposed Presidential Message to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>, attached to the Memorandum referred to above.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. Bundy suggested that the reference to “sophisticated” weapons be
                        deleted from the Seventh item of the message because of our use of such
                        weapons in Vietnam. It was agreed that the third sentence of the message
                        should refer to an exploration of ways to limit arms competition among the
                        countries concerned. In later discussion, General Goodpaster<note n="4" xml:id="d114fn4">Lieutenant General Andrew J. Goodpaster, <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff.</note>
                        <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0329"/>stated that, while the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> supported the measure described in
                        paragraph Seventh, they questioned whether it should be described in a
                        Presidential Message. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAW1">Barber</persName> said
                        the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> view was that this was a matter of
                        tactics, not of basic position. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> thought it useful to have a Presidential endorsement of the
                        idea (1) to put pressure on the many countries which have urged disarmament
                        by the great powers, and (2) to show that the United States does not intend
                        to stimulate arms competition between smaller countries. He added that he
                        thought Congress was likely soon to take the U.S. out of much of the arms
                        sales business anyway. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        indicated his belief that while the Soviet Union and the United States
                        sincerely desired some form of arms limitations upon themselves, there was a
                        great deal of hypocrisy about disarmament by many others.</p>
                    <p>General Goodpaster suggested that the measure not refer solely to developing
                        countries, which was agreed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested that an understanding among supplying countries
                        be sought. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> indicated that
                        part of the plan was to seek some such understanding about not supplying
                        costly prestige weapons to certain areas of the world.</p>
                    <p>3. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested that the
                        message, or Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s first speech
                        to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>, should refer to the fighting
                        in Vietnam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> read from
                        testimony on that point he had given that morning to the Disarmament
                        Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.<note n="5" xml:id="d114fn5">
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s testimony before the
                            Subcommittee on Disarmament of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
                            January 21, 1966, is printed in Executive Sessions of the Senate Foreign
                            Relations Committee (Historical Series): Volume XVIII, Eighty-Ninth
                            Congress, Second Session, 1966 (Washington, February 1993), pp.
                        105-131.</note> This testimony was to the effect that the great differences
                        with the Communists over Vietnam made our common interests in preventing
                        nuclear spread and curbing the nuclear arms race all the more important to
                        pursue at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agreed with this but suggested that the
                        draft message also indicate that Vietnam was an obstacle to disarmament, or
                        that the burden of armaments had increased because of the war there. He
                        asked that the message include a statement that the United States
                        Representative would be prepared to discuss, outside official channels and
                        with other representatives to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>, any
                        avenues toward peaceful settlement of Vietnam. Such a settlement would
                        permit a reduction of the burden of arms. The Vice President said we would
                        be ignoring facts of life if we did not recognize the impact of Vietnam on
                        the disarmament discussions.</p>
                    <p>4. General Goodpaster urged the elimination of paragraph Fourth of the draft
                        message. This paragraph repeats prior proposals for a comprehensive test
                        ban. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> objection was twofold: (1) no
                        adequate system <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0330"/>of verification had
                        yet been devised; (2) even if verification were possible, recent scientific
                        analyses show that information on hot x-rays which might help solve <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> and related problems may be available to
                        the Soviets (although not to the U.S.) and could be exploited to the
                        disadvantage of the United States. Chairman Seaborg explained that if this
                        were so, and if we tested up to several hundreds of kts underground, the
                        United States could also make progress in this area.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAW1">Barber</persName> pointed out that there was
                        no agreement within the government or within the intelligence community as
                        to the recent analyses referred to by General Goodpaster. He reported
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s view that
                        further analysis of the data should be made before any drastic change was
                        made in the United States position. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> concluded that deletion of paragraph Fourth would
                        reverse a Presidential decision made long ago. In his view our position
                        should remain the same while making the further analysis desired by
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> and others agreed.</p>
                    <p>5. General Goodpaster urged revision of the last sentence of paragraph Fifth
                        (cutoff and transfer) so that it would refer to verification by “on-site
                        inspection.” It was agreed that the message should be revised to refer to
                        “effective inspection.”</p>
                    <p>6. General Goodpaster suggested that the last sentence in paragraph Sixth
                        (freeze and reductions) should be revised to delete the reference to “issues
                        involved in both a freeze and the reductions which could accompany a
                        freeze.” It was agreed that this be revised to “issues involved in both
                        these proposals.”</p>
                    <p>7. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> suggested that
                        paragraph Second relating to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards be amended to add a phrase to the effect that the
                        non-proliferation treaty should itself provide a specific undertaking that
                        such safeguards be applied to peaceful nuclear activities. Commissioner Tape
                        said this would mean dropping out all of paragraph Second after the first
                        sentence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> objected to a
                        Presidential message urging that language be included in the treaty which we
                        knew the Italians and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would object to
                        before we had an opportunity to consult with them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> was also concerned about deleting
                        the remainder of the paragraph because of the importance of this language to
                        the Government's effort to secure adoption of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards in other ways than through a non-proliferation
                        treaty. After an exchange about the Senate debate on the Pastore
                        non-proliferation resolution,<note n="6" xml:id="d114fn6">Reference is to S.
                            Res. 179, 89th Cong., introduced January 18, by Senator John O. Pastore
                                (<gloss target="#t_D1">D</gloss>-RI) and adopted May 17, 1966, a
                            sense-of-the-Senate resolution supporting the President's efforts to
                            negotiate a nuclear nonproliferation treaty. (<hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament,
                            1966</hi>, pp. 306-307)</note> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested that the draft Presidential message endorse the
                        Senate's discussion. The Vice <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0331"/>President reported a discussion with Pastore before the resolution was
                        introduced. Although he had agreed with Pastore that the resolution was a
                        good idea, the Senate's position was now being interpreted as contrary to
                        that of the Administration. He felt it useful therefore that the
                        Presidential message refer with approval to the resolution.</p>
                    <p>8. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> objected to some
                        of the language in paragraph Fifth and several other drafting changes were
                        suggested by others present. Mr. Bundy expressed the view that there should
                        definitely be a Presidential message to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>. He asked that the draft be amended to reflect the comments
                        made at the meeting and submitted to the White House for final drafting
                        changes.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Dear Dean:</p>
                    <p>It has just come to my attention that proposals for transferring enriched
                        uranium to West Germany and Italy for military rather than civil purposes
                        are under study in the United States Government. Since such transfers would
                        seriously affect both our efforts to broaden the coverage of international
                        safeguards in non-nuclear countries and our efforts to negotiate a
                        non-proliferation treaty, I feel I should give you my preliminary views on
                        these proposals. I suggest that before any decision is taken to negotiate
                        such an agreement with West Germany or Italy, there should be full
                        discussion of these ramifications at the staff level among the Department of
                        State, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, and any other interested
                        agencies.</p>
                    <p>As you know, it is the current policy of the United States, as a key part of
                        our efforts to curb nuclear proliferation, to endeavor to broaden the
                        coverage of international safeguards on nuclear facilities in non-nuclear
                        countries. As part of this policy, we are transferring U.S. bilateral
                        safeguards to international safeguards and urging other countries to do the
                        same.</p>
                    <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0332"/>
                    <p>In my view, the United States should not enter into agreements with any
                        non-nuclear country to supply nuclear material for military purposes until:</p>
                    <p>(a) We have considered thoroughly the serious problems which would arise
                        directly and indirectly from establishing such a precedent, including the
                        effects on our efforts to persuade other supplier countries not to make
                        analogous transfers, and the effects on our non-proliferation treaty
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>(b) We have thoroughly explored alternative ways of meeting the desires of
                        the requesting countries. With respect to the specific requests now under
                        consideration, there would appear to be possibilities for working out such
                        alternative arrangements.</p>
                    <p>If, after consultation with all interested agencies of the government, it
                        were to be determined that it is in the net interests of the United States
                        to enter into any such military agreement with a Euratom country, I believe
                        that we should carefully consider at least imposing a requirement that the
                        transferred material be subject to the application of Euratom safeguards in
                        addition to U.S. bilateral safeguards. While this would not eliminate all of
                        the problems that such a military transfer would pose for the United States,
                        it would somewhat reduce the extent to which the transfer would undermine
                        our policy of promoting international safeguards on transferred nuclear
                        material. While I recognize that Euratom safeguards now cover only
                        non-military activities, I think we could probably persuade the country
                        concerned to request and receive Euratom inspections designed to assure that
                        the nuclear materials in question are not being used for the development of
                        nuclear weapons. If this were not done, a precedent would be established for
                        a troublesome “loophole” in the application of the Euratom safeguards system
                        to non-nuclear countries.</p>
                    <p>I believe that both Euratom safeguards and other alternatives should receive
                        our full study before a final decision is reached.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                            letter, reads in part as follows: “This letter now has the agreement of

                            and myself. We have managed to find language which gives a little more
                            reassurance to the Soviet Government on nonproliferation than we have
                            managed before now, while at the same time it fully protects our
                            interest in nuclear arrangements that will keep the Germans with us. The
                            major contribution is <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George

                            That definition is a shade more binding than the language we have used
                            before now, but it is entirely consistent with everything we have said
                            to the Germans.” (Ibid., National Security File, Subject File,

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">My dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>I should like, first of all, to congratulate you upon your role in bringing
                        together the Prime Minister of India and the President of Pakistan at
                        Tashkent and upon the agreement achieved there.<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">Reference is to the Agreement between India and Pakistan for a
                            Withdrawal of Troops in Kashmir and Normalization of Diplomatic

                            pp. 681-682.</note> As you know, we encouraged both India and Pakistan
                        to adopt a constructive attitude at these discussions. I am sure you share
                        my view that the agreement leaves many difficult problems between these two
                        countries unresolved, but progress toward peace anywhere is to be welcomed.</p>
                    <p>I regret that I am unable to report even a modest step toward peace in
                        Vietnam as we have had no significant response from the other side. I am, of
                        course, aware of the position of your Government in this matter and I refer
                        to it only to express my disappointment that the efforts of the United
                        States to stimulate the first moves toward peace in that unhappy area have
                        been met merely by a public repetition of rigid positions which are known to
                        be impossible for us to consider.</p>
                    <p>I have read with care your letter on the question of the non-proliferation of
                        nuclear weapons delivered by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on January 11, 1966.<note n="3" xml:id="d116fn3">

                        forthright statement of your views and welcome this opportunity to respond
                        frankly to some of the points on which our views differ.</p>
                    <p>You have emphasized the great significance which your Government attaches to
                        the problem of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The
                        long-standing concern of the United States with this problem <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0334"/>has been amply shown by the major
                        initiatives we have taken, beginning with the U.S. draft non-proliferation
                        declaration which was given to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> by Secretary Rusk in April 1963.<note n="4" xml:id="d116fn4">See <ref target="#d85fn3">footnote 3, Document
                            85</ref>.</note> The latest U.S. proposal was the draft
                        non-proliferation treaty presented at the disarmament talks in Geneva on
                        August 17 last year.<note n="5" xml:id="d116fn5">See <ref target="#d92">Document 92</ref>.</note> We welcome the fact that the Soviet Union
                        has also presented a draft treaty at this last session of the General
                            Assembly.<note n="6" xml:id="d116fn6">See <ref target="#d98fn2">footnote

                    </p>
                    <p>In order for us to approach a meeting of the minds on this question, I think
                        we must first agree on the meaning of the concept of “proliferation.” We
                        believe that “proliferation” results when a non-nuclear nation acquires its
                        own national capability or the right or ability to fire nuclear weapons
                        without the explicit concurrent decision of an existing nuclear nation. This
                        is the reasonable meaning of the term. It seems to us that we are much more
                        likely to reach an understanding by agreeing to a precise definition of
                        “proliferation” such as this than by attempting to discuss the question in
                        terms of such a loose concept as “access.”</p>
                    <p>If you agree to the above definition, you will, I believe, recognize that the
                        United States has shown its willingness to enter into an agreement that
                        would effectively forbid proliferation.</p>
                    <p>Our willingness is based on the strong conviction that it would be contrary
                        to the interests of the United States if any presently non-nuclear nation
                        were to acquire such a right or ability to fire nuclear weapons. In this
                        respect, I believe that your interests and ours coincide. Since you have
                        concentrated your comment on the Federal Republic of Germany, let me make it
                        clear that this position applies to the Federal Republic of Germany as to
                        all non-nuclear powers, and is so understood by the Federal Republic of
                        Germany.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, I must also make clear that we are not prepared to enter
                        into any agreement that would deny our allies the possibility of
                        participating in their own defense through arrangements that would not
                        constitute proliferation.</p>
                    <p>The situation would be different if the European member states of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> were not presently threatened by nuclear
                        weapons. But the unhappy fact is that the Soviet Union has many hundreds of
                        missiles with nuclear warheads aimed at the territories of these nations.
                        Under those circumstances our allies have a vital and just interest in
                        participating with us in their defense. That is the purpose of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and that purpose is steadfast. None of
                        the defense arrangements under discussion between the United States and its
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies would involve
                        relinquishment of nuclear weapons to the national control of a non-nuclear
                        country, <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0335"/>now or at any time in the
                        future. They are entirely consistent with, and indeed reinforce, the
                        principle of non-proliferation. To deny the possibility of such arrangements
                        might only promote proliferation by encouraging states to develop national
                        nuclear forces for their own protection.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, if because of unwarranted Soviet concern over possible <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense arrangements our two governments
                        failed to act together to meet the real threat of proliferation which looms
                        in other regions, that threat might spread even to Europe. Our two
                        governments would bear a heavy responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Some of the comments in your letter show a misunderstanding about the
                        effectiveness of the control that the United States maintains over its
                        nuclear weapons. Our physical and legal arrangements are and will remain
                        such as to insure beyond doubt that these weapons will not be used without
                        the consent of the United States Government. I can assure you that the
                        concerns you express on this point are groundless. It would be helpful to me
                        to have a similar assurance with respect to the arrangements you may have
                        with any of your allies as to which you have not provided us with any
                        information.</p>
                    <p>I have noted your comments with regard to the Federal Republic of Germany. I
                        must take strong exception to your unwarranted use of the epithet “West
                        German revanchists” in relation to the Bonn Government. The Federal Republic
                        of Germany has undertaken a treaty commitment never to use force to achieve
                        reunification or modification of its present boundaries, and to resolve by
                        peaceful means any disputes in which it may become involved.<note n="7" xml:id="d116fn7">Reference is to the Declaration by Chancellor Adenauer,

                        appropriate share in nuclear defense.</p>
                    <p>There can be no question of priority between arrangements for such defense
                        and a non-proliferation agreement since they are not in conflict with one
                        another. I can assure you that any arrangements we may conclude within
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> will not result in proliferation.
                        You can satisfy any concerns you may have on this score by joining with us
                        in a treaty that would prohibit all forms of proliferation of nuclear
                        weapons. The United States stands ready to sign such a treaty now.</p>
                    <p>To expedite the working out of an appropriate draft treaty, I accept your
                        proposal that representatives of our two governments exchange views during
                        the forthcoming session of the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee in
                        Geneva. The U.S. Representative will be authorized, in his capacity as
                        Co-Chairman, to conduct such an exchange of views with the Soviet
                        Co-Chairman. It is my hope that the opportunity thus afforded will be fully
                        utilized to remove any further misunderstandings that may hinder the
                        achievement of a mutually acceptable draft non-proliferation treaty. My
                        Government will make every effort toward that end.</p>
                    <p>I would also hope that, while giving urgent consideration to working out a
                        non-proliferation treaty, the Co-Chairmen will also renew their
                        consideration of other measures that could contribute to halting or limiting
                        the nuclear arms race.</p>
                    <p>For if the treaty we seek is to receive the widest adherence, we must take
                        account of the view expressed by a number of non-nuclear countries. They
                        have made clear that their renunciation of nuclear weapons would be
                        facilitated by evidence that the nuclear powers are themselves prepared to
                        halt the nuclear arms race.</p>
                    <p>Our Governments have a strong mutual interest in acting together to stop the
                        proliferation of nuclear weapons and in achieving a closer understanding on
                        other means to curb the nuclear arms race. I want to assure you of my
                        earnest intention to make the exchange of views that is about to take place
                        in Geneva a fruitful one and to contribute to the successful outcome I am
                        certain both of us deeply desire.<note n="10" xml:id="d116fn10">Printed from

                            (<hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1966</hi>, pp. 159-160)</note> Foster said that as
                        the President's message to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                        made plain we envisaged no plan which would involve relinquishing control
                        over U.S. weapons. Foster read following from President's message:</p>
                    <p>“Our physical and legal arrangements are and will remain such as to insure
                        beyond doubt that these weapons cannot and will not be used without the
                        consent of the United States Government. I can assure you that the concerns
                        you express on this point are groundless.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> then took text and read
                        back to Foster following:</p>
                    <p>“Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and I firmly
                        believe in the principle of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. There is
                        no conflict between this principle and the understanding that we reached
                        during the recent visit that there should be continued discussion … to work
                        out arrangements to assure <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members an
                        appropriate share in nuclear defense.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> then said that obviously
                        the U.S. continued to want to establish a new category of nuclear weapons
                        state as evidence by continued emphasis on nuclear sharing with FJCS.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> then further said that
                        as long as this was the U.S. position it would be impossible to make
                        progress; on contrary, if U.S. would but sign and accept the Soviet Articles
                        I and II Soviets considered that no access could take place and we could
                        thus achieve non-proliferation together.</p>

                                121</ref> and <ref target="#d122">122</ref>.</note> This is the
                        problem of relations between the negotiations on non-proliferation and our
                        efforts to get an agreed Atlantic nuclear policy. I think we have to walk a
                        careful line between contending groups which would give one or the other of
                        these related problems an overriding priority.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government continues to assert that any form of cooperation with
                        Bonn in the nuclear field is dangerous. While this position may in part
                        reflect a genuine concern about the Germans getting control over nuclear
                        weapons, it is also plain that the Soviets are seeking to use the issue as a
                        means of causing trouble in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        Alliance.</p>
                    <p>The main point of Soviet tactical pressure in the coming weeks is likely to
                        be the language of the non-proliferation treaty. They will be pressing for
                        language which would bar what they call “access” to nuclear weapons by
                        non-nuclear powers. Their evident purpose is to foreclose the possibility of
                        nuclear arrangements in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> which would
                        involve the Germans more intimately in the business of nuclear defense.</p>
                    <p>We are inclined to think that the best way to counter the Soviets on this—and
                        to get on with a constructive treaty—is to focus discussion on the true
                        meaning of proliferation, and, at the same time, to convince Moscow that we
                        will not sign a treaty which would rule out NATO nuclear arrangements which
                        would not, in fact, involve proliferation.</p>
                    <p>In our new draft treaty,<note n="3" xml:id="d119fn3">See <ref target="#d118fn4">footnote 4, Document 118</ref>.</note> we have
                        suggested that proliferation results when a non-nuclear nation acquires its
                        own national control, or the right or ability to fire nuclear weapons
                        without the concurrent decision of an existing nuclear nation. In addition,
                        there should be no increase in the number of states and organizations which
                        have control of nuclear weapons. In general, the draft represents an attempt
                        to come to grips with the real problem of proliferation without sacrificing
                        the legitimate interests of the non-nuclear members of the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>In any case, I think it most important that we not let the Soviets maneuver
                        us into a position which would arouse strong and honest resentment in
                        Germany. To let them do this would be no service to the cause of
                        non-proliferation, since it would increase the very dangers the Soviets
                        constantly stress.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government is surely not blind to one further aspect of this
                        matter—namely, that there is, on this issue, a pronounced difference <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0340"/>of emphasis between your public
                        opinion and ours. They are bound to see advantage in trying to exploit that
                        difference to set us against one another. We must be careful not to fall
                        into that trap.</p>
                    <p>My own view is that we should keep an absolutely evenhanded view of these
                        twin problems. A sound non-proliferation agreement and a sound Atlantic
                        nuclear policy are in truth mutually consistent and reinforcing. I do not
                        accept the argument that we must finally solve the Alliance nuclear problem
                        before there can be a treaty. But I think we should equally reject the
                        notion that we can push aside the Alliance problem now, and go along with a
                        treaty which would rule out, or drastically narrow, possibilities for a
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear arrangement which would
                        not result in proliferation.</p>
                    <p>On non-proliferation, we can meet the legitimate interests of the Soviet
                        Government because they are the same as our own. But we must not let the
                        Soviets use this most important issue to undermine German confidence in our
                        willingness to treat their nuclear problem seriously and constructively.
                        This course naturally tempts some in Moscow, but it is no more in the Soviet
                        interest than in ours.</p>
                    <p>I thought it would be useful for me to give you this indication of my own
                        thinking, because of the great advantage which comes to us both when we
                        stand together.</p>
                    <p>I hope you will have a good trip and I send you once again my best wishes for
                        success in your effort to get Soviet help in reconvening a Geneva
                        Conference. I am doing what I can to keep the public discussion here from
                        complicating your task, but it is an understatement to say that I do not
                        control it completely.</p>

                        possible to halt the peace-threatening spread of weapons of mass
                        destruction.</p>
                    <p>Naturally, we must in this connexion give thought to problems affecting our
                        own security. The basis of our security is the confidence in the Atlantic
                        alliance and in particular in the declarations made by the U.S. Government
                        within the alliance. I have particularly appreciated that you received my
                        ideas about the development of a joint nuclear force <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0342"/>within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> which I put before you during my visit to Washington, with
                        positive understanding. Provided that this plan will be realized, we are
                        prepared, as repeatedly stated, to envisage further international
                        commitments in the nuclear field. </p>
                    <p>In view of the security requirements of the alliance we have welcomed the
                        draft treaty submitted by your Government on 18 (sic) August 1965<note n="4" xml:id="d120fn4">
                            <hi rend="italic">Text in Documents on Disarmament, 1965</hi>, pp.
                            347-349.</note> as an important contribution towards solving the problem
                        of nuclear non-proliferation. We have now noted that your Government intends
                        to make some changes in the wording of the draft treaty which, in the
                        American view, are not supposed to affect the substance of the treaty.<note n="5" xml:id="d120fn5">See <ref target="#d118fn4">footnote 4, Document
                                118</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>On examination of the changes proposed by your Government doubts have,
                        however, arisen whether the amendments envisaged would not in fact narrow
                        down the present possibilities of the alliance to settle the nuclear
                        question. Thus, the new wording in particular raises the question whether it
                        is still beyond any doubt that the establishment of a European nuclear
                        force, in which majority decisions on the use of the weapons could be taken,
                        remains possible.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore the new wording of Article II of the draft seems to exclude the
                        cooperation of non-nuclear countries in the atomic armaments production of
                        nuclear states and thus to block certain perspectives which the German
                        Government would not like to see given up in view of future possibilities of
                        European-Atlantic cooperation, however remote they may be at present.</p>
                    <p>Generally speaking, we feel that the new draft because of its complicated
                        wording may give room for misinterpretation, a possibility of which the
                        Soviet Union may avail itself to the detriment of the Atlantic alliance.
                        Thus the Soviet Government might argue that the use from German soil of
                        tactical nuclear weapons under the command of SACEUR was not admissible,
                        even after a general release by the U.S. President. This would make an
                        element highly significant for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense
                        a subject of discussion with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>I would be very grateful to you, Mr. President, if another exchange of views
                        could take place between your Government and the German Government on the
                        extremely important question of how the objective of nuclear
                        non-proliferation could best and most effectively be attained.</p>
                    <p>Accept, Mr. President, the expression of my highest consideration.</p>
                    <p>m.p. May I in this connection once again express the hope that political
                        developments in 1966 will allow you to visit Europe including <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0343"/>Germany. You may be sure of the
                        enthusiastic concurrence of my countrymen.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and I would be extremely
                        glad to welcome on that occasion Mrs. Johnson as well.</p>
                    <p>Very sincerely, Yours (sgd) <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Ludwig

                    <p>1. This message reports Chalfont's briefing of <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> on his and <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>'s
                        discussions in Moscow last week.<note n="2" xml:id="d121fn2">See <ref target="#d119fn2">footnote 2, Document 119</ref>.</note> (Other

                    <p>2. Most important aspect to come out of <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Chalfont</persName> briefing and subsequent discussion in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> was that “moving target” is being presented
                        by Soviets and their allies so far as defining what proliferation really
                        means in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> context. As brought out by
                            <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Chalfont</persName> and Cleveland, Soviets
                        seem to have moved from defining proliferation as <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> sharing in ownership, to <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> access, and now to <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        “association” with nuclear arrangements. <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Chalfont</persName> pointed out that Polish rep at <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> on Mar 1 went one step further by objecting “to any
                        increased influence in the Western alliance by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.”</p>
                    <p>3. Following are highlights <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Chalfont</persName>
                        presentation on Moscow talks: He said <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> spoke of the one “insuperable” obstacle to
                        non-proliferation treaty as the whole complex of nuclear sharing problems.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was harder and more
                        vigorous than other Soviet spokesmen, <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0344"/>and made clear, with no ambiguity, that so long as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> contemplates any arrangement bringing the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> into closer association with nuclear
                        weapons, there will be no chance of a treaty. Soviets totally rejected
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> views that nothing contemplated in
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> involves proliferation. Soviets
                        said we are trying to bring the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> into
                        closer association and this constitutes a “political proliferation.” (In
                        reply to question from Alessandrini (Italy) as to origin of phrase
                        “political forms of proliferation,” <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Chalfont</persName> said this term originated with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.) Soviets specifically said it
                        would do no good to suggest that consultative arrangements are acceptable,
                        since this too is proliferation.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Chalfont</persName>, expressing his distress
                        over Soviet attitude, said it is up to US to assess whether this is
                        negotiating or final position. When pressed for his personal assessment,
                            <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Chalfont</persName> said he thought Soviets
                        are serious in wanting non-proliferation agreement, and that they will
                        finally, after long process, accept <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        nuclear arrangements which we can make clear do not constitute
                        proliferation. However, Soviets are aware of differences within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, see an opportunity to make trouble
                        within Alliance, and will play this as hard as possible.</p>
                    <p>5. At this point <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> commented
                        that Soviets have presented moving target on what they might accept in
                        sharing arrangements (para 2 above). He was not, however, clear as to
                        whether Moscow talks threw any further light on Soviet attitudes toward
                        existing <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> arrangements in Europe, which
                        their treaty draft seems to exclude. Chalfont replied that he could make
                        only general comment that Soviets seemed not to wish to attack existing
                        arrangements, although he pointed out that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        was careful not to raise this specific point in Moscow.</p>
                    <p>6. Concluding, <persName corresp="#p_CL2">Chalfont</persName> agreed with
                        moving target description, saying that Soviets are broadening objections
                        from technical to political forms of proliferation. He described this new
                        Soviet position as totally untenable and unnegotiable. We must therefore see
                        whether it is only a negotiating position. In these circumstances the prior
                        and urgent need is for East-West agreement as to what a non-proliferation
                        treaty would bar as proliferation. It appears, said Chalfont, that while we
                        can proceed with discussions at Geneva, this is a matter for specific,
                        high-level political decision.</p>

                            and he “suggested best venue for any further discussions would be

                        <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> told Soviets they are eager to extend TBT
                        to underground testing, but state of detection and identification art is
                        such that a small number of on-site inspections would still be necessary;

                        open to discussion. Soviet reply was that they too were anxious for
                        extension of TBT, but that any monitoring would have to be external. If West
                        insisted on on-site international inspections, discussion was completely

                    <p>At a luncheon which the Secretary gave for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> today, the Secretary raised the
                        question of peaceful uses of atomic energy which had been previously
                        discussed at the luncheon which the Ambassador had given for the Soviet
                        delegation on Cultural Exchanges on Wednesday, March sixteenth.<note n="2" xml:id="d123fn2">The March 16 memorandum of the conversation between
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> at the Soviet
                            Embassy on peaceful use of nuclear explosions states that <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> proposed U.S. cooperation with
                            the Soviet Union in this field in accordance with the memorandum on
                            cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy which Chairman Seaborg
                            and Chairman Petrosyants concluded in Moscow in 1963 (15 UST 631).
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, “I assumed that we would
                            proceed by each appointing a group of scientists to get together to
                            discuss the problem and to exchange information.” (Department of State,
                            Central Files, AE 6)</note> The Secretary gave the Ambassador a pamphlet
                        on possible uses of atomic energy for the construction of a sea-level canal
                        to replace the present canal in Panama.<note n="3" xml:id="d123fn3">Not
                            further identified.</note> He said, of course, that our interest
                        extended beyond this and there was a possibility of building ports in
                        countries which needed them and other uses of this sort. He pointed out that
                        one of the issues which arose was that of radioactive debris getting into
                        the atmosphere as a result of operations for <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0347"/>such purposes. The Secretary said we would be prepared to
                        have technical talks with a view to exchange of information in this field,
                        as well as discussions concerning the relationship of peaceful uses to the
                        limited Test Ban Treaty. The Secretary said he was not making any proposal
                        but simply thinking out loud and said he could imagine the possibility of
                        some sort of machinery by which the Soviet Union and the United States could
                        assist countries interested in using nuclear energy in peaceful projects. He
                        said it seemed clear that neither side would wish to let others have access
                        to its nuclear devices, but he understood that there could be the
                        possibility of observation to make clear that the operation was the peaceful
                        one it purported to be and not a test of an atomic weapon.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador asked if Panama had given its consent to the use of nuclear
                        energy for the construction of a new canal. The Secretary did not answer
                        this question directly but mentioned that several possible sites were under
                        consideration, both in Panama and in other countries.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that he would discuss this matter with his Government
                        when he returned to Moscow.</p>

                        believe doing so would constitute a constructive U.S. initiative. It would
                        emphasize once again our interest in international cooperation in outer
                        space, and it would signal the progress of this country in moving toward a
                        manned lunar landing.</p>
                    <p>We have cleared with other Executive Branch agencies the text of a draft

                                transmitted to Kurt Waldheim, Chairman of the U.N. General Assembly
                                Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space on May 9, cited in
                                    <ref target="#d127">Document 127</ref> except for one
                                substantive difference. Article 3 of this draft contains the
                                following sentence that is not in the later draft:</p>
                            <p>“A State conducting or planning to conduct activities on a celestial
                                body shall provide reasonably in advance of each mission,
                                notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.”</p>
                        </note> This treaty would bar claims of sovereignty to the moon and other
                        celestial bodies, guarantee freedom of scientific investigation and free
                        access, and call for international cooperation in studies relating to
                        celestial bodies. The treaty would prohibit military fortifications,
                        military maneuvers, weapons tests, and stationing nuclear weapons on a
                        celestial body.</p>
                    <p>I think the best way to move ahead is to make an announcement publicizing the
                        principal elements of the proposed treaty. Later, when negotiations are
                        begun, we will be ready to discuss with other governments the text of treaty
                        provisions.</p>

                            not been adequately considered by the McMillan Panel as means of coping

                    <p>(b) launch phase vulnerability to gamma and X-rays</p>
                    <p>(c) vulnerability of re-entry vehicles</p>
                    <p>The panel concluded that this was a particularly bad time for the US to
                        consider entering into a comprehensive test ban. The Soviets were seen to
                        have a considerable advantage in any test ban situation: greater internal
                        security, greater manpower control, larger payload capacity of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, and ability to advance through
                        clandestine testing.</p>
                    <p>In my judgment, the attached comments further underline the seriousness of
                        the situation, since these two men who were disposed against testing from
                        the beginning indicate agreement with the technical vulnerabilities
                        highlighted by the basic panel report. Further, the basic report had already
                        been softened considerably in the process of obtaining the original approval
                        of these two gentlemen.</p>

                    <p>Enclosed for your consideration is a draft letter to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> setting forth a proposal for an
                        eighteen-month halt in the construction of fixed land-based strategic
                        offensive missile launchers and antiballistic missile launchers.<note n="2" xml:id="d126fn2">Not printed.</note> The proposal could be adequately
                        verified by our respective national capabilities to satisfy both the U.S.
                        and the U.S.S.R. that the national security of our countries was not being
                        adversely affected by action taken contrary to its terms. It, therefore,
                        would not require negotiation of the complex arrangements for formal
                        international verification.</p>

                    <p>You will recall that last January 4 Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> suggested for your consideration the possibility of
                        including a similar proposal either in your State of the Union Message or in
                        a private letter to Soviet leaders. It was decided at that time that the
                        matter was more appropriate for a private letter than a public speech but no
                        private communication was dispatched because of a feeling that it might
                        confuse the discussion of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons which had
                        become the subject of private correspondence between you and the Soviet
                        leadership on January 11.<note n="3" xml:id="d126fn3">
                            <ref target="#d108">Document 108</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I believe the present time is appropriate for resuming the consideration of a
                        letter from you to the Soviet leadership making such a proposal. Such a
                        letter would be a logical follow-up of the discussions on the problem of
                        strategic nuclear vehicles which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> had
                        with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> prior to his
                        departure for Moscow. A letter from you would assure such a proposal the
                        appropriate careful consideration by the Soviet leadership.</p>
                    <p>We would of course wish to review the letter should Ambassador <hi rend="italic">Dobrynin</hi>, upon his return from Moscow, raise any
                        matters relating to this subject. But with this caveat in mind, I believe it
                        would be worthwhile to proceed now with the appropriate consideration of
                        this subject within the government.</p>
                    <p>I believe that such a proposal would clearly be to the net advantage of the
                        U.S. in terms of relative ratios of forces. Nevertheless, there may well be
                        serious interest in such a proposal on the part of the Soviet leaders. It
                        might well afford a rationale for Soviet leaders to forego an extensive
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> program, which would result in an
                        economic payoff for the Soviet Union in terms of decreased expenditures.
                        Such an undertaking would also involve the promise of possible future
                        reductions in defense spending. In addition, the political consequences of
                        such an arrangement may be sufficiently attractive to induce serious
                        consideration of the proposal by Soviet leaders. And finally, at a minimum,
                        it would open up a dialogue at the highest level, something that seems
                        particularly needed at this time if we are to move towards a greater meeting
                        of minds upon practical methods of curbing the arms race.</p>
                    <p>This proposal has not been coordinated within the Government although it
                        takes into account some of the views expressed within the Government when
                        the earlier suggestion was made by Mr. Foster in January. It will, of
                        course, be advisable to have the discussions of the problem presented by
                        this memorandum, including the problem of what allied consultation should be
                        held, before sending a letter of this kind.</p>

                        would discuss the draft letter with you.</p>

                        Weapons tests and military maneuvers should be forbidden.” (Statement read

                                the latest developments. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> said that the U.S. draft of the treaty was very
                                similar to the Soviets' draft. “We should be able to make an
                                agreement because they took the points from your letter and
                                incorporated [them] in their treaty, a very interesting
                                development,” he remarked. In briefing the Senate Foreign Relations
                                Committee the previous day, he had said that the treaty contained no
                                military or security considerations and both Senators Symington, who
                                attended as a representative of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
                                and Anderson said they supported the U.S. draft. Throughout

                    <p>6. Celestial bodies should be used for peaceful purposes only. No country
                        should be permitted to station weapons of mass destruction on a celestial
                        body. Military fortifications, weapons tests, and military maneuvers should
                        be forbidden.</p>
                    <p>7. A launching State should be entitled to exercise authority over its

                        consideration the following suggestions in the field of arms control and
                        disarmament.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Non-Proliferation Agreement</p>
                    <p>The subject that has received the greatest attention during recent
                        negotiations is, of course, a non-proliferation agreement. Such an agreement
                        is looked upon by many as the most logical and urgent next step forward in
                        arms control and disarmament. An initiative on our part to break the present
                        deadlock on this subject is dependent upon the decisions that are to be made
                        on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear sharing arrangements. If
                        these decisions do not involve a “hardware solution,” it may well prove
                        possible to negotiate an agreement with the Soviet Union without sacrifice
                        to any legitimate interest of any member of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance. The United States should, we believe, avoid
                        dismissing a non-proliferation agreement with the oversimplified arguments
                        that since the Soviets do not intend to proliferate anyway, there is little
                        value in an agreement with them; and that if other countries wish to go
                        nuclear, this would be a matter of such supreme national interest that a
                        treaty would not stand in their way. Without a non-proliferation agreement
                        it is fair to say that we have no hope of stopping the spread of nuclear
                        weapons on the basis of unilateral appeals. On the other hand, if we and the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were to agree to a
                        non-proliferation treaty, probably all of the non-nuclear powers that are in
                        danger of going nuclear would find it difficult not to adhere to such a
                        treaty. Thus the issue would not be whether a treaty would stand in the way
                        of the supreme national interest of such countries. The issue would rather
                        be whether a US-Soviet sponsored international consensus, finalized in a
                        treaty, would be a factor to be taken into account in determining what the
                        supreme national interest of these countries was. Clearly it would be.</p>

                    <p>Recent significant improvements in seismic identification capabilities now
                        make it possible for the US to verify through national means an extension of
                        the Limited Test Ban agreement to cover all underground tests having a
                        seismic magnitude of 4.75 or higher. Thus we are, with respect to
                        underground tests of a magnitude of approximately 30 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss> or higher, in a situation very similar to that of 1963 with
                        regard to tests in the atmosphere, underwater and outer space. An agreement
                        of this type would not be a complicated one since no international
                        inspection machinery would have to be created. Moreover, the mere making of
                        such a proposal would itself be highly regarded throughout the world as a
                        constructive step forward.</p>

                    <p>To estimate the impact of a Threshold Test Ban Treaty on Soviet military
                        programs, with particular emphasis on its impact on Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> activities; to discuss the capabilities of
                        US intelligence to monitor such a test ban; and to evaluate Soviet
                        capabilities for covertly violating it.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Foreword</p>
                    <p>The Threshold Test Ban Treaty considered in this estimate is generally in
                        line with proposals under discussion in the US and abroad, but it does not
                        reflect a specific proposed treaty. We assume continuation of the terms of
                        the Partial Test Ban Treaty now in effect, which prohibits testing of
                        nuclear devices in the atmosphere; beyond its limits, including outer space;
                        underwater (including both territorial waters and the high seas); or in any
                        other environment if such explosion causes radioactive debris to be present
                        outside the territorial limits of the state under whose jurisdiction or
                        control such explosion is conducted. The Threshold Treaty considered in this
                        estimate would add to the restrictions of the current treaty a prohibition
                        of any underground nuclear test producing a seismic disturbance above 4.75
                        on the Gutenberg-Richter scale. It is assumed that treaty language will
                        specify a method by which a mean magnitude for any particular event will be
                        established, thus avoiding international disputes about the magnitude of
                        reported events. It imposes no limitations on the underground medium in
                        which the tests take place, or on the degree of decoupling employed. It
                        provides no on-site inspection and no sanctions. Each participating national
                        will have to decide for itself whether any given seismic event of magnitude
                        greater than 4.75 was caused by a nuclear detonation and constituted a
                        treaty violation.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. We believe that for most of the Soviet military development programs which
                        we can foresee over the next few years a Threshold Test Ban <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0358"/>Treaty would impose no greater restrictions
                        than those already imposed by the Partial Test Ban. However, the
                        relationship between the yield of underground explosions and the resulting
                        seismic readings is uncertain at best, and can be greatly altered by
                        decoupling. The Soviets might therefore still test over a wide range of
                        yields, depending on how far they were willing to risk violating the treaty
                        and to support the cost and effort of decoupling. Practically speaking, we
                        believe that they could develop weapons yielding [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] by scaling up from
                        lower yield tests which would have a fair chance of not producing seismic
                        readings above 4.75. They might conceivably develop <gloss target="#t_TN1">TN</gloss> weapons with yields [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                            source text not declassified</hi>] by expensive decoupling methods.
                        (Paras. 13-19)</p>
                    <p>B. With respect to <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> weapons, we think
                        there is about an even chance that the Soviets have already [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                        exoatmosphere <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> warhead yielding [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. If
                        they have not already done so, a Threshold Treaty would not, in our view,
                        make such a development impossible, as we believe existing Soviet weapon
                        technology would support it either without further testing, or with tests
                        that would have a reasonable chance of not exceeding the threshold. (Paras.
                        10-12, 20, 21)</p>
                    <p>C. We believe that a Threshold Treaty would impose prohibitive restrictions,
                        beyond those of the Partial Test Ban, only for developing weapons which
                        might need new warheads yielding [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                            source text not declassified</hi>]. If the development of such weapons
                        had a sufficiently high priority the Soviets might conduct tests virtually
                        certain to violate the treaty, in the belief that the violation could not be
                        proved against them. As few as one or two such tests a year could be of
                        significant aid to their military programs. (Paras. 18, 19, 30-33)</p>
                    <p>D. The US Atomic Energy Detection System (<gloss target="#t_AEDS1">AEDS</gloss>) would almost certainly detect all seismic events in the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> with a magnitude of 4.75 or
                        greater. Perhaps with help from [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                            source text not declassified</hi>] sources, it could probably
                        discriminate between explosions and earthquakes occurring in most parts of
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, but there would still be a few
                        events a year over 4.75, especially in the Kamchatka-Kuriles area, which
                        could not be so identified. Such events would represent possible treaty
                        violations, but it would be extremely unlikely that intelligence could with
                        certainty either confirm or deny that a nuclear event had in fact occurred.
                        (Paras. 23-28)</p>
                    <p>E. If a seismic event over 4.75 was identified as an explosion, it would
                        almost certainly be nuclear in origin. Thus this evidence, combined with
                        what might be available from intelligence sources, would probably be
                        sufficient, except in a few cases, to determine to the satisfaction of the
                        US government whether or not the explosion was nuclear in origin. Evidence
                        sufficient to convince a world forum that an explosion <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0359"/>was nuclear could almost certainly be
                        derived only from on-site inspection, which is not permitted by the
                        Threshold Treaty under consideration. (Paras. 25, 29)</p>

                    <p>1. Non-Proliferation. My final report to you from Geneva (Disto 2210)<note n="2" xml:id="d131fn2">At this point the source text bears the following
                            handwritten note: “(below at clip; Sec saw),” referring to telegram
                            Disto 2210 from Geneva; not found.</note> describes a possible shift in
                        the Soviet position. As you know, both in public and private, the Soviets
                        have previously taken a tough and extreme line against any <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> “access” to nuclear weapons, including
                        “political access,” such as the Special Committee. Their public attacks on
                        our non-proliferation treaty have continued to be extreme. However, in
                        private conversations at Geneva, both Soviet and Bloc representatives have
                        now shown awareness of the need to accommodate any non-proliferation treaty
                        to the reality of continued nuclear consultations and, by implication at
                        least, to the reality of present nuclear arrangements in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>From comments by Soviet and Czech staffs and Polish representatives, it
                        appears they do not really expect any formal burial of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> hardware proposals, which they say they
                        consider “dead” anyway. They seem to want some assurance, presumably in the
                        treaty, that continuing <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0360"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> arrangements, including improved
                        consultative machinery, will not serve as a front for future hardware
                        arrangements and that participants in any consultative group will not
                        acquire power of decision regarding actual employment of nuclear weapons (as
                        distinct from participation in questions of strategy, deployment, etc.).</p>
                    <p>We have no way of knowing whether the Soviets and Bloc representatives are
                        genuinely, though cautiously, seeking serious negotiations. As a result of
                        increased tensions over Viet Nam, this may not be the case. Nevertheless, I
                        believe we should consider whether there are ways we can test Soviet
                        willingness to move to more reasonable positions. With this in mind, I
                        recommended in cable 2210 from Geneva that we give serious thought to the
                        possibility of a general non-proliferation formula which neither expressly
                        permits nor prohibits a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> “hardware”
                        option. We do not believe the Soviets could utilize a withdrawal clause in
                        such a treaty to interfere seriously in the affairs of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> because withdrawal as such would not give
                        them any practical basis for taking action against our interests, i.e., they
                        will presumably not wish to disseminate in any event. Our allies would, of
                        course, have to be consulted.</p>
                    <p>In practical effect, this amounts to a recommendation that we take a serious
                        look at the current price of getting a non-proliferation treaty. I shall
                        want to discuss this further with you.</p>
                    <p>I cannot help but believe that a non-proliferation treaty would have
                        fundamental value beyond the field of non-proliferation. On the one hand,
                        there would be unquestioned political value to us in achieving a major arms
                        control agreement with the Soviets in view of the state of Sino-Soviet
                        relations. On the other hand, it would be particularly unfortunate if the
                        U.S. becomes isolated on arms control issues at a time when, because of the
                        repercussions of the Viet Nam situation, the U.S. badly needs to demonstrate
                        its desire to seriously negotiate measures contributing to international
                        stability and curbing the nuclear arms race.</p>
                    <p>2. Soviet Willingness to Cooperate in Test Ban Verification. In Geneva, the
                        Soviets requested a Co-Chairman's meeting in order to inform us of their
                        willingness to participate in the exchange of national seismic data.
                        Exchanges would be on a “voluntary” basis and analysis of data would be done
                        by national institutions rather than by an international center. The Soviets
                        professed an interest in bringing U.S. and Soviet viewpoints closer together
                        to enhance long-range prospects for agreement. I replied that we welcomed
                        their interest in data exchanges but this could not be a substitute for
                        necessary on-site inspections. The Soviets did make clear that their
                        interest in exchanging seismic data was not contingent on the U.S. dropping
                        its demand for on-sites.</p>
                    <p>Although the Soviets may be attempting to undercut our position on on-sites,
                        it is also a possible indication that, in the arms control field, they are
                        willing to work towards agreement, despite Viet Nam. We <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0361"/>should not under-estimate the significance
                        of the Soviet move. The Soviets know that international exchange of data is
                        basically directed at improving the capability of other countries to
                        determine what is happening inside the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union is,
                        in fact, willing to exchange data toward this end, it will be a most
                        important step.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_SNDV1">SNDV</gloss> Freeze and Reductions. On
                        instructions,3 I formally asked the Soviet Co-Chairman whether his
                        government would be interested in the possibility of a freeze on the
                        manufacture of <gloss target="#t_SNDV1">SNDV</gloss>s if this could be
                        accompanied by reductions. I read to him a list of issues which we proposed
                        for discussion in the event they were interested. A week later, the Soviets
                        indicated their recognition that we had made a serious proposal and
                        requested a paper setting forth the issues to be discussed. We provided the
                            paper,<note n="3" xml:id="d131fn3">Not further identified.</note> but
                        have not yet received their response.</p>

                            to have heavily discounted the European clause option, and have been
                            leveling their main attacks in the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>
                            against any form of multilateral association. Consequently, it would
                            appear doubtful whether a change in our position on the European option
                            would substantially improve our tactical position in Geneva.” A cover

                    <p>(b) there is no increase in the total number of States and associations of
                        States having control of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>As the United States Government are aware, Her Majesty's Government have
                        always considered that a non-proliferation treaty should exclude the
                        possibility of nuclear dissemination to associations of States, whatever
                        their membership and whether or not an existing nuclear power should cease
                        to have control of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Her Majesty's Government understand the considerations which have caused the
                        United States Government to leave open a “European option” in their draft
                        treaty. But it seems to them that the only such option strictly compatible
                        with non-proliferation would be a fully federated European State, which
                        would acquire by succession the nuclear status of either France or the
                        United Kingdom or both. In such a case no transfer of control would be
                        involved and there would be no need for a non-proliferation treaty to be so
                        worded as to provide for it. On the other hand, the idea of transferring
                        control of nuclear weapons to a European association of States, where
                        decisions could be taken by majority vote, is not easy to reconcile with a
                        straightforward statement of non-proliferation requirements.</p>
                    <p>Her Majesty's Government believe that their concern on this point is shared
                        by an increasing number of governments and that the need to preserve a
                        “majority vote European option” constitutes an unnecessary weakness in the
                        presentation of the Western case at Geneva. During the last session of the
                        E.N.D.C. Soviet attacks have increasingly concentrated on the possibility of
                        creating mixed associations with numerous non-nuclear members—and these
                        attacks seem to have some success in enlisting the sympathies of the
                        non-aligned countries. If the U.S. draft treaty could be amended so as to
                        close this option, the West would be in a better position to rebut Soviet
                        criticism and to persuade the non-aligned countries, at Geneva and
                        elsewhere, of the sincerity of its support for non-proliferation.</p>
                    <p>Her Majesty's Government hope that, if the United States Government agree
                        with the above, they may be ready to support them in raising the matter once
                        again, first with the Canadian and Italian Governments, and afterwards with
                        the Federal German Government. They suggest that, in order to close the
                        “majority vote option” in the U.S. draft treaty, it would be sufficient to
                        omit Clause 3 in Articles I and II as well as the words “non-nuclear-weapon”
                        and “such” where they qualify the words “association of States” in these two
                        Articles.</p>

                    <p>On June 29, 1964 (15 UST 2128), July 15, 1965 (16 UST 888), and June 2, 1966
                        (17 UST 1966), the United States and the United Kingdom renewed their
                        Agreement for Cooperation in the Civil Uses of Atomic Energy of June 15,
                        1955 (6 UST 2709). In June 1965 the United States suggested that the renewed
                        agreement should contain provision for safeguards of the International
                        Atomic Energy Agency on any material transferred. The British agreed to
                        application of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards to enriched
                        uranium purchased under a new agreement for use in the British civil power
                        program. They also reserved their position in the event the United Kingdom
                        joined Euratom for the application of Euratom safeguards on materials
                        transferred under a new U.S.-U.K. Agreement for Cooperation in the Civil
                        Power Applications of Atomic Energy, signed June 2, entered into force July
                        15, 1966 (17 UST 862). Because of the intermixture of British civil and
                        military atomic energy programs, they could not agree on the application of
                        international safeguards to highly enriched uranium purchased from the
                        United States for use in their civil research and development program.

                    <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName>:</p>
                    <p>I think the growing pressures for proliferation in India indicates that we
                        should reconsider our position on the nonproliferation treaty. I suggest
                        that we consider language in our draft treaty which would make clear that
                        the United States and other nuclear powers would each maintain a veto over
                        its weapons. I have enclosed proposed language to this effect.</p>
                    <p>May we discuss these proposals at your convenience.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                    <p>The President made an introductory statement apparently written for him by
                        Rostow recognizing the urgency of some action in connection with the
                        possibility of India making a decision to go nuclear. In those remarks he
                        stated that this had great significance for the United States and the world
                        and might, if India made such a decision, promote great instability in view
                        of the fact that others would undoubtedly follow. He then called upon
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0367"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> made an excellent statement
                        based largely on the paper,<note n="2" xml:id="d136fn2">The paper has not
                            been further identified.</note> but going beyond that in setting a
                        framework of actions which needed to be taken, both in the way of creating
                        obstacles against India taking the step, and in addition creating conditions
                        which would encourage her to believe her security would be all right without
                        taking the step. He listed alternatives which would act as obstacles such as
                        the non-proliferation treaty, comprehensive test ban treaty and the
                        threshold treaty, stating that the comprehensive test ban would be ideal in
                        that it was nondiscriminatory but that in the circumstance of the
                        difficulties concerning verification he felt that the threshold test ban
                        treaty was a good step even though it did not assuredly prevent their going
                        nuclear. It would, however, impose considerable restraint. He called
                        attention to the rising price which India was implying it would need in
                        order to accept a non-proliferation treaty. He pointed out the discussions
                        we had had with the Soviet Union on assurances by both the Soviet Union and
                        ourselves, and indicated his feeling that under present circumstances at
                        least it would be impossible to get the Soviets to take a position so
                        clearly in opposition to the Chinese. He gave support to the possibility of
                        a General Assembly resolution which was later supported vigorously as
                        apparently the answer to all problems by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The President, following <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>'s
                        presentation, called on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> and then on Bob McNamara. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that he would differ with <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s conclusions on the ideal solution,
                        but his differences were matters of degree and generally he supported the
                        principles set forth by Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>
                        referred to the General Assembly resolution as having been premature last
                            fall,<note n="3" xml:id="d136fn3">The U.N. resolution has not been
                            further identified.</note> but he believed that it was much more
                        possible now in view of the apparent willingness of the Soviet Union to use
                        the General Assembly for the new space proposals.</p>
                    <p>The President, following comments by those three asked what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s recommendations were. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> recommended that there be a study
                        which would be concluded within a month to make more precise the exact lines
                        of action to be taken. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        supported that. The President said he thought this was all right. I asked to
                        be heard at this point and said that I had no objection to this, certainly,
                        except as a matter of timing since there was already a good deal of data on
                        this and that in fact there would be a meeting of the Committee of
                        Principals next week to consider one or more of the suggestions which had
                        been made. My feeling of urgency was occasioned by the fact that the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> was opening next Tuesday.<note n="4" xml:id="d136fn4">The Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee met in Geneva
                            June 14-August 25.</note> It would last, presumably from 8 to 12 weeks,
                        and I felt <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0368"/>that it was essential
                        that some proposals be put forward by the United States early in that
                        period, otherwise no action could occur and the value of the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> might vanish. I felt that in the
                        circumstances it should be possible to come up with conclusions within two
                        weeks for decision by the President. Unfortunately, the President is
                        apparently planning on a long weekend over the Fourth, so this probably puts
                        it over until the Fourth. In any event, the conclusion of the meeting was
                        that there would be a <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> referring to
                        State, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> the job of coming up with recommendations following this
                        discussion.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President indicated quite surprisingly that he thought India could
                        have credible nuclear explosions and some capability for the expenditure of
                        perhaps $50 million in addition to past expenditures. He appeared to be
                        somewhat less than enthusiastic about a threshold test ban treaty and felt
                        that the comprehensive treaty was the best solution. I did not disagree with
                        him on this, but told him that we were concerned with the art of the
                        possible and the only thing that appeared possible is the threshold test ban
                        treaty.</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, Hornig should be talked to by Pete Scoville because Hornig
                        believes that many of the non-nuclear nations would be able to have an
                        initial test up to 50 kilotons under the threshold test ban treaty by proper
                        utilization of the many sources of alluvium throughout the world. I
                        disagreed with this after the meeting and told him that I would have Pete
                        talk to him.</p>
                    <p>Under the circumstances, I think we got as much out of the meeting as it was
                        possible to get.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MLH1">Leonard Marks</persName> brought up the question
                        of next Tuesday being the 20th Anniversary of the Baruch presentation<note n="5" xml:id="d136fn5">See <ref target="#d97fn5">footnote 5, Document
                            97</ref>.</note> and thought that the United States should use the
                        occasion to call for a major restudy of the problems of proliferation. The
                        study should take place under the auspices of scholars from the academic as
                        well as the government field. There was no response to this suggestion.</p>
                    <p>I do feel we must make some note of the Baruch anniversary in our opening
                        statement at Geneva even though we are unable to accompany it with any
                        dramatic proposals.</p>

                            Meeting—In the course of their meeting today, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and Bill Foster discussed
                            non-proliferation, improved detection measures, and the freeze and
                            reduction of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> reports receiving a clear
                            implication that, if the Soviets could be sure that Germany would not
                            use or would not be able to use nuclear weapons on their own decision, a
                            non-proliferation treaty would be possible. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stated that Soviet Embassies in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> capitals had reported that no one
                            except the Germans had any interest in a change in present nuclear
                            arrangements. He said they were prepared to make arrangements with us at
                            Geneva for the exchange of seismic data. In an aside he said they were
                            shuffling their diplomatic corps to replace about thirty of their older
                            Ambassadors.” (Ibid.)</note> I met with Bill Foster and obtained the
                        following additional information.</p>
                    <p>The discussions of the Non-Proliferation Treaty came in the middle of an
                        extended discussion of the status of a broad range of Arms Control measures.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> reports that, while
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> did not state flatly
                        that the Soviets would sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty if we rejected the
                        hardware solution to nuclear sharing, he did indicate quite clearly that
                        this was the area of their concern and that they were not concerned with
                        present US weapons in Germany or with the possibility of more substantive
                        consultation between us and our allies on the use of nuclear weapons.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he understood
                        the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was going to table revised
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty language that would differ from ours. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> did not respond to <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s comments on the importance of some
                        sort of multilateral nuclear assurances for non-nuclear countries such as
                        India in connection with the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of my brief discussion with <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, I don't believe there were any other particularly
                        significant points to report. With regard to the freeze on strategic
                        offensive-defensive delivery systems, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> commented that it was so complicated that he did not
                        think there was much point in discussing it at Geneva now. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> appeared to agree with Foster's
                        standard argument as to why we should have a freeze on ABMs but did not
                        offer any suggestion as to what should be done about it.</p>

                    <p>In response to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s question as
                        to whether we had actually made a no-first-use proposal to the Communist
                        Chinese, <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> explained that we
                        were simply trying to clarify what Chou En-lai had proposed in his earlier
                            statement.<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">In an address at a Sino-Albanian
                            Banquet on May 10, Premier Chou said that “China has proposed to the

                            being the first to use nuclear weapons against each other. But U.S.
                            imperialism has rejected China's proposal.” (<hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament,

                        a memorandum for the President summarizing the argumentation and issues on
                        the threshold test ban proposal. The Secretary said he would attach to the
                        memorandum the more detailed comments that have been submitted from the
                        various agencies.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Non-Proliferation Treaty</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State said he would circulate as soon as possible for
                        consideration by the Principals a revised non-proliferation treaty draft.
                        The Secretary said the revised draft would be a more simplified version of
                        Article I than the present U.S. draft and would focus on “physical access.”</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> outlined the principal
                        reasons why the threshold proposal had been brought to the Principals once
                        again, referring to the <gloss target="#t_AFTAC1">AFTAC</gloss> report
                        showing that seismic identification was excellent for events above 4.75,
                        thus indicating a threshold could be verified without on-site
                            inspection;<note n="5" xml:id="d138fn5">The report by Dr. Evernden of

                            distributed in February 1966, but has not been found.</note> Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> said it was, moreover,
                        important to keep the dialogue with the Soviets on non-proliferation open
                        and it appeared that the threshold proposal was at this time the only way we
                        could take some initiative in this area. It was, he said, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>'s belief that the question should be
                        raised with the President and he hoped the Committee of Principals would
                        agree to submit the issues to the President.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> noted the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                        objections to the threshold proposal. He said it was, nevertheless, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>'s view that the proposal was in the U.S.
                        interest, recognizing that it would however require considerable political
                        effort to obtain its acceptance in Congress. The inhibitions placed on
                        non-nuclear powers would inhibit them, both technically and in a political
                        sense, from achieving their nuclear ambitions. He said he recognized,
                        however, that technically the threshold ban would not prevent a test by
                        presently non-nuclear powers if sufficient effort were made to conduct one
                        but nevertheless the inhibition would be there. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> commented that within the government
                        the discussion had tended to go back and forth between moving in the
                        non-proliferation field by enlarging the present limited test ban treaty or
                        by making a new effort for a non-proliferation treaty.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary of State said the first question was whether the proposal was
                        in the U.S. interest and if the answer was affirmative the second was should
                        we attempt to achieve it by formal agreements or by unilateral undertakings.</p>
                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> referred to the
                        concerns regarding the proposal that had been expressed in his letter of

                    <p>The Secretary of State commented that the problems described by Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> would apply doubly to a
                        comprehensive test ban. He asked what our assessment was as to where the
                        Soviets are with their <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> development.
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> said there was some
                        evidence that they are up to where the U.S. is at the present time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> pointed out that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> of the Department of
                        Defense took a different view than the weapons laboratories with respect to
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> warhead developments that would be
                        possible under the threshold test ban.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>'s comment on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s views dealt with the first point he had wished to make,
                        and the second was to inquire about the observations made by Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> in his letter to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> regarding the difficulties
                        of differentiation and identification of events under a threshold test ban.</p>
                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> said there was no
                        real assurance that we could test at 30 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss>
                        and not violate a threshold ban, [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source
                            text not declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> commented that the 30
                            <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss> figure was based on the <gloss target="#t_AFTAC1">AFTAC</gloss> studies. He also noted the hidden
                        asymmetries between nuclear and non-nuclear powers that would make it more
                        difficult for non-nuclear powers to initiate a test program under the
                        threshold limitation.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH1">Marks</persName> noted the differences
                        between the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> judgments on the inhibitions a threshold
                        ban would place on non-nuclear powers, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> reviewed the political as well as the technical
                        inhibitions that <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> believed would apply
                        to non-nuclear powers under a threshold ban.</p>
                    <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0373"/>
                    <p>The Secretary of State said that a non-nuclear state might well merely
                        declare that it had a nuclear weapon but say it was not going to test it; he
                        said if the Israelis made such a statement he would probably be inclined to
                        believe them.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Scoville</persName> commented on the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> warhead need, saying he did not understand
                        why we could not make better use of existing weapons technology [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. We
                        already have this capability, he said, in the lower and higher yield ranges.
                        The Vice President said this was a point that needed to be examined
                        carefully. Chairman Seaborg said the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>
                        Study had examined the question raised by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Scoville</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KSMJ1">Keeny</persName>
                        commented that the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> Study had merely
                        looked at the existing devices. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> said it might be possible to modify [<hi rend="italic">less than 1/2 line of source text not declassified</hi>] and have some
                        type of defense against <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense then summarized the objections and questions he
                        believed had been raised by the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> to the
                        threshold proposal. They were, he said, that the threshold ban would not get
                        us very much in the way of inhibiting proliferation; the price would be some
                        reduction in our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability, if it were
                        decided to go this route; there was some question as to our ability to
                        distinguish events above 4.75; and finally the problems raised by the
                        peaceful uses question.</p>
                    <p>In response to the Secretary of State's question about the possibility for
                        cheating above 4.75, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>
                        said the margin for cheating was very good. He said the Soviets could
                        conduct two or so clandestine tests a year unless we had on-site inspection.
                        General Johnson noted that the studies that have been made are for a period
                        when the Soviets have been testing in their normal test areas and not
                        attempting clandestine tests. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> stated that the <gloss target="#t_AFTAC1">AFTAC</gloss>
                        study indicated there would be an average of one event a year that would be
                        unidentified by seismic means and that these events were almost all in the
                        Kamchatka area. Moreover, for this area no low coupling material was
                        available—therefore it would not make sense for the Soviets to go to an area
                        where the coupling was not advantageous in an attempt to test illegally what
                        they could test legally in other areas where coupling was more satisfactory
                        for their purposes. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>
                        restated his view that the Soviets could test clandestinely two tests a
                        year. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Scoville</persName> pointed out that
                        the U.S. would be able to spot all suspicious events whether identified or
                        not and to focus on these events with intelligence resources. Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> said we could not,
                        however, prove to the world any of our conclusions.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion of the coupling question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> pointed out that decoupling would be
                        perfectly legal under the threshold test ban. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> said there was no question but that
                        the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> problem was the most bothersome of
                        the difficulties <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> had with the threshold
                        proposal. He suggested that the U.S. go on as fast as possible <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0374"/>to meet our testing requirements for <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> warheads and in a year or two we would have
                        most of our needed testing for this purpose completed.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State asked about the effects of a threshold at 5.0.
                        Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> said this would help
                        with the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> problem but of course it would
                        not be much of an inhibition on non-nuclear countries.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> said the intelligence
                        community was agreed that a threshold test ban would have little effect in
                        halting proliferation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>
                        questioned this assessment, pointing to the technical and political
                        inhibitions he believed would apply. He said, moreover, that Soviet-U.S.
                        agreement on a threshold ban would itself have a very real effect on
                        potential nuclear countries. The Secretary of State said a threshold ban
                        might, during the process of ratification that would take place in potential
                        nuclear countries, precipitate a debate over the question of going or not
                        going nuclear.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH1">Marks</persName> wondered if our posture
                        would not suffer more by making the threshold test ban proposal and having
                        the Soviets respond with a call for a moratorium than in not making the
                        proposal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> pointed out that
                        new verification data will not remain unknown for very long and said that
                        when it becomes known the U.S. will either have to be in favor of a
                        threshold proposal or change its present position of being prepared to ban
                        all tests that can be adequately verified.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President wondered if a threshold test ban would really inhibit
                        proliferation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> said there
                        was no certainty it would prevent proliferation but it would make it more
                        costly and more difficult and therefore decrease the likelihood of
                        proliferation. He said it was <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>'s
                        conclusion that this was the only way we could move at the present time to
                        inhibit proliferation in view of our policy on options we were keeping open
                        on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear questions. He said it was
                        either moving on the threshold proposal or doing nothing. He added that the
                        question for the meeting really was whether the issue should not be put to
                        the President.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State said he believed the President should be informed of
                        the discussion. He thought it would be advisable for him to prepare a two or
                        three page memorandum for the President, digesting the issues and arguments
                        involved, with the detailed comments from various departments attached.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President questioned the value of a country going nuclear if a
                        potential adversary was likely to develop an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system, and he wondered if the cost factors would not be too
                        high for various potential nuclear countries. The Secretary of State said he
                        believed India, Israel, Sweden and others could afford to go nuclear, though
                        they might underestimate the ultimate cost to them of doing so.</p>

                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> noted that with

                    <p>In response to the Vice President's question as to the real objectives of a
                        threshold ban, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> said it was
                        both turning down the nuclear arms race and inhibiting the proliferation of
                        nuclear weapons. The Secretary of State commented that in terms of creating
                        an atmosphere of peace the threshold test ban would certainly not be
                        comparable to Soviet action for peace in South East Asia.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said that if the threshold proposal did not curb nuclear
                        technology it was not clear how it would really inhibit the proliferation.
                        Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> said that it was
                        necessary to settle the Plowshare question before any decision was made on
                        the threshold proposal.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that if it were agreeable with the Vice President, he
                        would put together for the President a digest of the issues on the threshold
                        proposal. He said he would like to review the issues himself before making
                        final judgment on the proposal. He commented that he was concerned about the
                        problem of ultimate cheating and the problem of defending this possibility
                        in any U.S. debate on a threshold proposal.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State said he would like to turn for a moment to the
                        question of a non-proliferation treaty. He said the Soviet representative in
                        Geneva had seemed to put an emphasis on “physical access.” He thought we
                        might consider the possibility of a simplification of Article I of the U.S.
                        draft treaty. The Secretary of Defense said he completely agreed with this
                        suggestion.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State said we should consider a simplified Article I that
                        would prohibit the transfer of physical access to nuclear weapons. He said
                        he would be sending to other members of the Committee of Principals as soon
                        as possible a simplified text for their consideration. He added that it may
                        be that the Soviets are beginning to move and would be prepared to gamble on
                        their estimate that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is dead.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow asked if a prohibition on physical access would be compatible with
                        joint ownership. The Secretary said he did not believe ownership was
                        relevant to the problem of proliferation, although he did not believe that
                        we should be opposed to other countries paying some of our costs if they
                        wished to.</p>

                    <p>Dear Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>:</p>
                    <p>In accordance with your suggestion at today's meeting of the Principals,<note n="2" xml:id="d139fn2">See <ref target="#d138">Document
                        138</ref>.</note> I am forwarding herewith a few comments, from the
                        intelligence point of view, on the proposed Threshold Test Ban Treaty
                        (TTBT).</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">2-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] On the
                        Soviet side, we believe that <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment
                        has begun at Moscow. In our judgment, the chances are about even that the
                        Soviets have developed an exoatmospheric <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        system [<hi rend="italic">2-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>].
                        Our evidence, however, is skimpy, and the Soviets may well be further along.
                        If not, there will be great pressure on them to develop a highly
                        sophisticated system, since they are certainly aware in general terms of
                        U.S. plans for improving warheads and penetration aids, e.g., multiple
                        re-entry vehicles. The Soviets have shown considerable willingness to risk
                        violation of the present test ban treaty, and even one or two tests a year
                        above magnitude 4.75 would give them significant advantages. Thus, the
                        Soviets could forge ahead of the U.S., unless the U.S. were itself willing
                        to violate the <gloss target="#t_TTBT1">TTBT</gloss>, or at least risk doing
                        so.</p>
                    <p>I do not believe that the <gloss target="#t_TTBT1">TTBT</gloss> will have
                        much effect in slowing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It was agreed
                        at the Principals' meeting that the technical restraints imposed by the
                        treaty would create additional difficulties for non-nuclear states in
                        carrying out nuclear programs meaningful to them, but would not prevent it.
                        On the political side, we are all agreed that China will not sign. Hence,
                        the pressures on the countries being threatened by China will continue to
                        grow as China conducts further tests. I do not believe that the <gloss target="#t_TTBT1">TTBT</gloss> or even a non-proliferation treaty would
                        deter a country from going nuclear if it felt that its vital interests were
                        threatened.</p>
                    <p>Regarding verification of a <gloss target="#t_TTBT1">TTBT</gloss>, there is
                        an important distinction between convincing ourselves that a violation has
                        occurred and proving it to others. There could be endless controversy about
                        the magnitude and especially the nature of events which we believed were
                        over magnitude 4.75. In general, convincing proof of a violation could come
                        only from on-site inspection.</p>

                        the Executive Office staff. I wish to confirm that it is most important that
                        we retain a test readiness posture and maintain an active plan to resume
                        testing should it be necessary.</p>
                    <p>I note that the Program is sufficiently broad in scope as to provide maximum
                        flexibility of response in the event we should have need to resume testing
                        in any of the environments now prohibited by the limited test ban treaty.
                        This approach is sound, and its flexibility should continue to characterize
                        our planning.</p>
                    <p>The Program should be periodically reviewed to insure that it takes into
                        account the advances made in our underground test program and the other
                        research and development work at the laboratories and within the Department
                        of the Defense. Periodically this Program needs updating and any significant

                    <p>A new arms control initiative aimed at inhibiting the spread of nuclear
                        weapons has been given serious consideration by the Arms Control and
                        Disarmament Agency and discussed with the Committee of Principals at its
                        meeting on June 17. The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency suggestion is
                        for a Presidential proposal for a new test ban agreement, expanding the
                        present Limited Test Ban Treaty to cover verifiable underground tests.</p>
                    <p>No consensus was reached at the Principals' meeting on the desirability of
                        making a proposal for a threshold test ban at this time. It is suggested
                        that you may wish to discuss this personally with the Principals.</p>
                    <p>The following is a summary of the major issues which must be considered in
                        reaching a decision on the U.S. proposal in this area. A more detailed draft

                        Test Ban Treaty </p>
                    <p>While all agree that as a technical matter a non-nuclear country could test
                        its first weapon under a threshold test ban which could be reasonably
                        verified at the present time, it would nevertheless increase the technical
                        difficulties and cost and, at the same time, reduce the political and
                        military gains from such a development. Key potential additional nuclear
                        countries, i.e., India, Israel, Japan, Sweden and Germany, would doubtless
                        sign a threshold test ban and as a result probably would be <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0379"/>constrained to test at about the 5 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss> level, since they seemingly have neither the
                        soil conditions nor the experience to conduct tests at much higher yields
                        without serious risk of violating the threshold. The threshold would prevent
                        the development of an advanced military nuclear capability.</p>
                    <p>There are differences of opinion as to the importance of these constraints
                        and on the willingness of such countries to risk a violation if they had
                        signed such a treaty. The Department of State and the Arms Control and
                        Disarmament Agency, however, believe that these constraints might be a
                        significant factor in preventing a decision by these countries to go
                        nuclear.</p>
                    <p>We cannot be sure at this time what the Soviet reaction to such a U.S. offer
                        would be, since previously the Soviets have always linked the threshold test
                        ban to a moratorium on all underground tests. A moratorium is completely
                        unacceptable to the United States. A Soviet response of this type would
                        limit the political gains obtained by offering a threshold ban but on
                        balance the U.S. position of being willing to ban all tests it can verify
                        would be better than it would be otherwise, particularly when knowledge of
                        the improved detection capability became public.</p>

                        Ban Treaty</p>
                    <p>Recent developments in the field of seismic detection and identification of
                        underground events indicate that all contained underground explosions with
                        seismic magnitudes above 4.75 generate seismic signals with characteristics
                        common to all such explosions and that only a very small number of
                        earthquakes above magnitude 4.75 (on the average of one per year in the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>) have signals which cannot be
                        distinguished from explosions and which therefore might provide false
                        alarms. The suspiciousness of even these few false alarms would be further
                        reduced by investigation of their location and by the use of other
                        intelligence sources. Furthermore, the number of these natural events which
                        cannot be identified by seismic means decreases rapidly with increase in
                        magnitude and is essentially zero at magnitude 5.</p>
                    <p>There are differences of opinion among the Principals on the adequacy of this
                        degree of verification at the magnitude 4.75 level. Some feel that even a
                        single Soviet nuclear test above the threshold could have a significant
                        effect on U.S. security and that either the low natural false alarm rate
                        could be used as a cover for such a test or that the United States would not
                        choose to denounce a violation and abrogate the treaty based only on seismic
                        evidence supported by unilateral intelligence. They believe that some type
                        of on-site inspections would be required as well in order to provide
                        demonstrable proof to the world. Others believe that this verification
                        capability would provide the United States the ability to satisfy itself
                        that a violation had occurred and that the United States could take the
                        necessary international actions if it felt its security were affected.</p>

                        of the Nike-Zeus system designed against a Chinese Communist threat could be
                        regained under the constraints of a threshold test ban by system changes at

                        nuclear tests could probably be carried out within the next year or two in
                        order to achieve such developments. There are also a number of differences

                    <p>The magnitude of an event is proposed to be defined as the mean of the
                        measurements obtained by at least nine standard stations located between
                        1,500 and 6,000 miles from an event. The United States now operates more
                        than twelve stations, some of which are classified, which could be used to
                        make a determination of magnitude by the United States with respect to
                        events taking place in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Few stations now exist outside the United States jurisdiction which meet the
                        qualifications for a standard station. Twenty-five to thirty properly
                        distributed standard stations would be required in order to assure that at
                        least nine stations at the desired distances will be able to measure the
                        magnitude of events of m4.75 and above in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, United States, India and Israel. Such stations could be
                        constructed with equipment readily procurable in 1-5 years depending upon
                        the intensity of effort <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0381"/>and
                        cooperation of host countries. In the absence of such a network of stations
                        and the public availability of data therefrom, there would be no
                        internationally accepted data base for a magnitude determination for a given
                        event, leaving the way open to possible international controversy concerning
                        the magnitude of a given event.</p>
                    <p>The threshold magnitude proposed by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
                        and used as a basis for most of the studies was 4.75 which might permit
                        tests up to 30 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss> on the part of the United
                        States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> without significant
                        risk of violations, and about 5 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss> on the
                        part of the key non-nuclear nations. The Atomic Energy Commission feels that
                        the United States might be constrained to tests at lower yields to avoid
                        risking inadvertent violation. Consideration has been also given to
                        establishing the threshold at 5.0 which would allow U.S.-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> tests at about 80 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss> and non-nuclear country tests at about 12 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss>. Such a threshold would reduce the number of
                        false alarms from natural earthquakes in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to essentially zero. It would also permit the development of
                        some of the more conventional type Nike-Zeus warheads by the United States
                        and presumably the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. On the other hand,
                        raising the threshold would reduce the effect of the treaty in discouraging
                        the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Moreover, it would be difficult for
                        the United States to justify raising the threshold to 5.0 in light of
                        current detection and identification capabilities at 4.75, and there would
                        be strong sentiment on the part of other countries to retain the familiar
                        4.75 threshold.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">E. Explosions for Peaceful Uses</p>
                    <p>The present Limited Test Ban Treaty provides severe limitations on explosions
                        for peaceful excavations purposes and a threshold treaty would add some
                        additional limitations. The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency has proposed
                        provisions in these treaties which might permit peaceful uses explosions but
                        many believe that such provisions would provide legal or illegal
                        opportunities for weapons development intended to be forbidden by the
                        treaty. Studies are now underway in the Atomic Energy Commission and the
                        Arms Control and Disarmament Agency to elaborate on the significance of such
                        loopholes and to develop additional procedures to close them. The Atomic
                        Energy Commission believes that the United States should not make any
                        proposals on a threshold test ban until an agreed position is reached within
                        the Government concerning the extent to which nuclear explosions for
                        peaceful purposes would be permitted under such a treaty, and the specific
                        treaty provisions relevant to such purposes which would be acceptable to the
                        United States.</p>

                        clearance by the Alaskan Governor and Congressional delegation for the

                        following comments:</p>
                    <p>On the whole, we can regard the negotiations to date as reflecting great
                        credit upon the United States, for the following reasons:</p>
                    <p>1. Negotiations came about as a result of initiative taken by the President
                        on May 7, in calling for negotiations looking to a treaty.<note n="4" xml:id="d143fn4">See <ref target="#d127">Document 127</ref>.</note> This
                        was initially resisted by Soviets who finally had to go along under the
                        pressure of world opinion. This fact recognized and emphasized during the
                        course of negotiations here in Geneva.</p>
                    <p>2. The attitude of the U.S. delegation in accordance with Department
                        instructions has been forthcoming and this too has resulted in very
                        favorable claim on world opinion both diplomatically and in the world press.
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                        declassified</hi>] confirmed that it is the shared opinion among the
                        delegations irrespective of ideology that Soviets have been placed at a
                        disadvantage by reason of forthcoming and conciliatory attitude of the U.S.
                        delegation.</p>
                    <p>3. In final statements by delegates winding up this phase of deliberations,
                        only Hungary and Bulgaria fully supported Soviet reservations which for time
                        being blocked a treaty. It is interesting that statements by Poland and
                        Romania did not expressly support key Soviet reservation on equal access and
                        reporting. Unless the Soviets remain unwilling because of Vietnam to
                        conclude an agreement in General Assembly, I see no reason why a final
                        treaty text cannot be speedily concluded once the Committee reconvenes in
                        New York.</p>
                    <p>My own analysis of Soviet actions here is that Morozov, the Soviet
                        representative, was acting under instructions not to make a final agreement
                        in Geneva but to reserve a few points as a delaying maneuver. It is my
                        impression that Soviets were unwilling because of concern about <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0384"/>Chinese criticism to make it appear that
                        they were agreeing with us too readily on an international treaty of this
                        importance. An alternative explanation is that Soviet delegation at Geneva
                        was concerned about the possibility of a government shake-up and desired to
                        confirm their instructions in Moscow personally before making final
                        agreement. Although present government was confirmed by Supreme Soviet
                        during last stages of our negotiations in Geneva, Morozov in private
                        conversation with me several times referred to the necessity of consulting
                        with “new” government.</p>
                    <p>Whatever the cause, it will be very difficult for the Soviets in the light of
                        the great support the U.S. received in the Committee among other delegations
                        including all non-aligned countries to block an acceptable treaty draft at
                        General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I want to convey to the Department the excellent cooperation I
                        received from all members of the U.S. delegation, particularly <persName corresp="#p_MLC1">Meeker</persName>, Reis, Helman (State Department);

                    <p>1. This memorandum outlines a possible new peaceful initiative in the nuclear
                        field. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> believes
                        there is a fair chance that the Soviet Union might be prepared to join with
                        us in this proposal. If so, it could pave the way for further nuclear
                        cooperation at a time when we are at an impasse over a nonproliferation
                        treaty.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Need for a New Plowshare Arrangement</p>
                    <p>2. As now worded, the language of the Test Ban Treaty severely restricts us
                        in using peaceful nuclear (Plowshare) explosions to dig tunnels, harbors,
                        etc. This is a point of concern, for example, in connection with the
                        proposed Panama sea-level canal.</p>
                    <p>3. The Treaty does, however, permit underground explosions, whether for
                        peaceful or military purposes, so long as they do not cause fall-out beyond
                        national limits. Recently there have been some indications that India might
                        set off underground explosions on the excuse that it was developing a
                        Plowshare capability. In this way it could acquire most of the technology
                        needed for military weapons.</p>
                    <p>The proposed scheme would—among its other benefits—remove this excuse. It
                        would thus discourage India and other countries from becoming military
                        nuclear powers through the back door—on the pretext of acquiring Plowshare
                        capability.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nature of Initiative</p>
                    <p>4. Under the initiative I propose we would invite the Soviet Union to join
                        with us in a common undertaking to make available to all the nations of the
                        world—nuclear and non-nuclear alike—the benefits of Plowshare explosions for
                        public works projects in their countries. This would involve the creation of
                        an international corporation or other entity that would arrange for,
                        approve, and authorize the US or <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                        conduct such Plowshare explosions. Together we would seek an amendment to
                        the Test Ban Treaty that would permit such explosions when approved and
                        authorized by the international corporation.<note n="2" xml:id="d144fn2">As
                            more fully discussed in the attachment, the international entity could
                            be given authority either over all Plowshare explosions (including
                            presently lawful underground shots) or over only those explosions of the
                            crater-making type that may violate the present Test Ban Treaty. The
                            first alternative would have the advantages mentioned in the attachment.
                            [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>5. By providing for membership on the entity's Board of Governors for
                        representatives selected by the 93 non-nuclear signatories of the Test Ban
                        Treaty, we would assure a strong voice for non-nuclear states in the control
                        and utilization of this new technology. At the same time the arrangements
                        could be so set up as not to compromise the security of our own Plowshare
                        devices or to create an intolerable risk of military advantages for the
                        power conducting the explosion.</p>
                    <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0386"/>
                    <p>6. As you know, a proposal to permit Plowshare explosions was discussed
                        during the Test Ban negotiations, and elicited some Soviet interest. A draft
                        Plowshare section of the Treaty was largely agreed with some major open
                        points but, by mutual consent, it was then dropped as too complicated in the
                        rush to sign the ultimate Treaty.</p>
                    <p>7. However, the Treaty was made relatively easy to amend. With the approval
                        of only one-third of the 96 signatories, the Original Parties (US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>) can
                        call a conference to consider a proposed amendment. The amendment itself can
                        be adopted by a simple majority of the signatories including all three
                        Original Powers. Dissenting signatories are legally free to withdraw, but
                        are unlikely to risk the world-wide opprobrium that would result.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Benefits of Proposal</p>
                    <p>8. The proposal promises a number of cumulative benefits that increase in
                        importance depending on how far we can get with it. For example:</p>
                    <p>a. By presenting the plan to the Soviets, we could begin a useful dialogue
                        with them, based on our mutual interest in deterring proliferation and in
                        sponsoring peaceful nuclear applications. The discussion themselves would be
                        valuable, regardless of their outcome. (The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would, of course, have to be brought in at the outset.)</p>
                    <p>b. If the discussions are fruitful, joint US-Soviet sponsorship of a Test Ban
                        Amendment would be a major diplomatic breakthrough, regardless of whether
                        the Amendment is ultimately adopted by the other signatories. Apart from the
                        impact of a joint US-Soviet initiative, key features of the plan would have
                        world wide appeal. The major nuclear powers would be offering the other
                        signatories the economic benefits of peaceful explosions on attractive terms
                        when and if Plowshare proves economically feasible, as well as a strong
                        voice in the international agency that decides when and how such explosions
                        would be conducted in the light of the military and fall-out risks and the
                        economic and political criteria involved.</p>
                    <p>c. If we get this far, it should be easy to get the support of one-third of
                        the Treaty signatories to convene a Conference. The Conference itself would
                        have major political value whatever its outcome, and could help to delay
                        proliferation efforts by the nuclear-capable signatories (e.g., India and
                        Japan).</p>
                    <p>d. With the US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> agreed, it should not be too hard to get
                        the simple majority vote needed to adopt an amendment. If adopted, the
                        amendment might help to deter the nuclear-capable signatories from
                        proceeding with their own programs by lawful underground tests. The
                        amendment would deprive them of both political and economic arguments
                        sometimes used to justify going it alone. It is an open question whether the
                        remaining military arguments for going ahead with national programs would be
                        persuasive to most countries.</p>
                    <p>e. If economically viable Plowshare projects are developed and if the
                        international agency works out the many problems involved in approving them,
                        the world can begin to realize another constructive potential from having
                        unlocked the atom. But should the economics and hazards <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0387"/>of Plowshare projects prove so intractable
                        that few if any operations are approved and conducted for many years to
                        come, we will still have achieved all of the other benefits described above.</p>
                    <p>f. If the Soviets agree to the international entity plan, we could then
                        discuss with them whether to offer the plan as an independent proposal apart
                        from the current Anti-Proliferation, Threshhold Test Ban and Total Test Ban
                        proposals now being discussed at Geneva, or whether to go the further step
                        of agreeing with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on some
                        compromise version of one of those other proposals, and then offering the
                        two as a single package. A joint package proposal would clearly be better if
                        it proves feasible, but if we are able to agree with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> only on the international entity plan for
                        Plowshare, I would favor proceeding with this alone.</p>
                    <p>9. I attach a memorandum spelling out some aspects of the proposal in more

                        Geneva between July 12 and August 4.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Negotiations</hi>—We agreed at an early stage to expand
                        the scope of a treaty from celestial bodies to outer space generally. The
                        Soviet draft Treaty had proposed this broader scope with which we were
                        prepared to go along, as the Soviet text was drawn in large part from <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions which we had taken the leadership
                        in obtaining. We held a number of private bilateral discussions with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in which points of agreement and
                        disagreement were defined. The proceedings of the Legal Subcommittee
                        reflected the results of these discussions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Results</hi>—Agreement was reached on thirteen substantive
                        points (Tab <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss>). The most significant of these
                        are (a) the translation into a treaty obligation of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution banning the placing of weapons of
                        mass destruction in orbit, outer space or on celestial bodies; (b) an
                        unconditional commitment to assist and return astronauts who land in another
                        state and to publish discoveries relating to astronaut safety; and (c) the
                        proscription of claims of sovereignty over and national appropriation of
                        celestial bodies.</p>
                    <p>There are two principal issues which divide us at the moment:</p>
                    <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Access</hi>—We insist that the principle of free access
                        to all installations and vehicles on celestial bodies be reflected in a
                        treaty, subject only to reasonable safety precautions. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has sought to qualify the right of access
                        with such concepts as “reciprocity” and agreement as to the timing of
                        visits.</p>
                    <p>b. Reporting—Our treaty article as tabled provides for compulsory reporting
                        to the Secretary-General on the nature and location of activities on
                        celestial bodies and publication of information on the results of these
                        activities for the benefit of the public and the international scientific
                        community. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> insists that the
                        reporting obligation should be voluntary.</p>
                    <p>There are two other differences which should not prove as difficult. One
                        relates to the types of military structures to be prohibited on celestial
                        bodies and the nature of the equipment to be permitted. We are substantially
                        in agreement with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on permitted and
                        prohibited structures <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0389"/>and
                        equipment, but have not been able to reflect this in treaty language. The
                        other difference involves a <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> proposal
                        which would require a state hosting a tracking installation to grant similar
                        facilities to other space powers. We suspect that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> tabled such a provocative proposal to
                        serve as a barrier to the conclusion of a treaty until they are ready for
                        one.</p>
                    <p>We received generally strong support from members of the subcommittee for our
                        position on the disagreed provisions. Tab <gloss target="#t_B1">B</gloss>

                    <p>Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>In the light of my memorandum to you of August 12, 1966,<note n="2" xml:id="d146fn2">The memorandum under reference sets forth Rostow's
                            conclusions from his thoughts on nonproliferation and arms control which
                            he elaborated in an attached memorandum of the same date to the
                            President. (Ibid., <persName corresp="#p_BFM1">Bator</persName> Papers,
                            Non-Proliferation, August 1, 1966-September 27, 1966, Box 30)</note> I
                        have talked with Bob McNamara at length about the non-proliferation treaty.</p>
                    <p>He agrees that the heart of the matter is this: so long as we are committed
                        to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> we cannot, should not, will not
                        give up our veto over the firing of nuclear weapons in that theater.</p>
                    <p>The issue arises in connection with the “European clause”: it never arose
                        with the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, where the retention of our
                        veto was universally accepted.</p>
                    <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0391"/>
                    <p>There have been several U.S. statements in the past which implied that if the
                        Europeans fully united we would not rule out the possibility of their having
                        an independent right to fire nuclear weapons from a presumably integrated
                        European nuclear force. Behind these statements were three judgments:</p>
                    <p>—It was wise to encourage the movement towards European unity, and unity
                        would be encouraged by “not ruling out” the possibility of a European force
                        with a right to fire as independent as that now enjoyed by U.K. and France;</p>
                    <p>—If and when the Europeans ever got to a position of true integration and
                        seriously contemplated the problem, they would, in fact, not ask for the
                        surrender of the U.S. veto, because they would lose more in the dilution of
                        the U.S. commitment this would bring about than they would gain by this act
                        of “independence;”</p>
                    <p>—If and when the Europeans ever got to a position of true integration, and
                        there was a European executive equivalent to the President of the United
                        States, a rational arrangement could be worked out with that executive
                        consistent with the requirements of the alliance.</p>
                    <p>The non-proliferation treaty forces us to face this issue sooner than we
                        might otherwise have to face it; because the European clause in the treaty
                        makes a reality out of a quite distant but important contingency.</p>
                    <p>If we are now to probe <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and the
                        Russians deeply as to the possibility of a non-proliferation treaty, Bob
                        McNamara's and my judgment is that the probe should take place on this
                        question: Would the Russians sign a treaty if we were to guarantee that we
                        would not surrender under any future circumstances, and whatever the form of
                        nuclear organization in the West, our veto over the firing of nuclear
                        weapons?</p>
                    <p>As I said in my memo, this is the one issue on which the Russians might have
                        a legitimate interest in the nuclear organization of the West, and it is an
                        issue where Russian and U.S. interests converge with those of Europe, if the
                        Europeans think the matter through.</p>
                    <p>If Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> should find that
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was willing to accept a
                        non-proliferation treaty based on this principle, we would, however, then
                        face an interesting problem of persuading the Europeans to accept this
                        proposition. I believe the job could be done because, at bottom, what the
                        Europeans are really groping for—although they are not very clear about
                        it—is not an independent right to fire, but an insurance policy against the
                        possibility that at some future time some American administration might pick
                        up its nuclear weapons and its troops and go home. The British and French
                        national nuclear capabilities and a future possible European nuclear force
                        is a kind of insurance that, if we should ever move in this way, Western
                        Europe would not be left naked of nuclear capacity.</p>
                    <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0392"/>
                    <p>But so long as we remain a fully committed ally of Europe, Europeans can, I
                        believe, be made to see:</p>
                    <p>—that it is ridiculous for them to think of firing their nuclear weapons
                        without ours; and</p>
                    <p>—that the threat to use a small nuclear force in Europe to engage us in a
                        nuclear war to which we were not committed could only lead to the U.S.
                        pulling back and dissociating itself from European defense.</p>
                    <p>No American President is going to place in the hands of the Europeans—or
                        anyone else—the right to determine when we are engaged in a nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>The outcome of such sober and careful discussion with the Europeans would, I
                        believe, be an understanding that so long as they wanted our total
                        commitment, including a nuclear commitment, to the defense of Europe, a
                        European nuclear force could relate to ours only on the same basis as the
                        two-key system now works: namely, that affirmative action both by Europe and
                        the U.S. would be necessary for the firing of nuclear weapons in defense of
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we suggest that:</p>
                    <p>1. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> focus on this
                        question of the continued U.S. veto in his talks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>;</p>
                    <p>2. If it emerges that this is the critical issue with Moscow, we then tell
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that we must talk with
                        our allies and then come back to him.</p>
                    <p>I am raising this with you at Bob McNamara's request. He feels that you,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, and he ought to talk
                        about this before the conversation with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is undertaken in New York. For some reason he did not
                        feel free to raise it directly with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, as I suggested he might. It is possible that Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> would have views which
                        differed from Bob's and mine in this matter; and he may have alternative
                        formulae to suggest to try out on <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
                    <p>This matter is so fundamental that you may wish to budget for a small and
                        quite leisurely meeting with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in which we could hear Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s views about how to probe <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>; Bob McNamara would have a chance
                        to express his; and you would have a chance to give Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> guidance for his talks on this subject
                        with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
                    <p>To recall my own approach to this question of the U.S. veto, I am attaching

                        request of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. The Panel was requested
                        to address itself to the following questions.</p>
                    <p>a. What types of weapons development or effects tests could be carried out as
                        part of legitimate or defendable peaceful uses explosions programs within
                        the terms of a limited, a threshold and a comprehensive test ban treaty?</p>
                    <p>b. What would be the probability of verifying that no illegal weapons
                        development or effects tests were carried out as a part of a peaceful uses
                        explosions program?</p>
                    <p>c. What is the military significance of developments which might be carried
                        out under “a.” above and by illegal means?</p>
                    <p>d. What types of verification arrangements could be incorporated in such
                        treaties in order to reduce to acceptable levels the risk that U.S. security
                        might be compromised by development under “a.” and “b.” above?</p>
                    <p>The Panel met in Washington on June 28, 1966; in Livermore, California, on
                        July 14, 1966; in Los Angeles on July 30, 1966; and in Washington <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0394"/>on August 21, 1966 to examine these
                        questions and to receive information on the status of U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Plowshare and weapons test programs.
                        Particular attention was paid to techniques for carrying out actual nuclear
                        weapons tests. Sub-groups of the panel also met to examine various more
                        specialized problems associated with the topic.</p>
                    <p>It was not a function of the Panel to evaluate the usefulness of specific
                        projects for peaceful uses of nuclear explosions or the value of such
                        programs as a whole; likewise it was not a function of the Panel to evaluate
                        the merits or demerits of specific test ban proposals per se, except insofar
                        as additive provisions to such test ban proposals relating to peaceful uses
                        explosions might provide opportunities for obtaining weapons development or
                        weapons effects information, or contribute to the proliferation of nuclear
                        weapons technology. Consequently it should be made clear that, although our
                        report contains numerous definite conclusions, it does not contain
                        recommendations for or endorsements of either specific test ban proposals or
                        specific projects relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>The Panel would like to express its appreciation for the cooperation received
                        from <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> and from the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> staff and its laboratories, particularly

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Conclusions</p>
                    <p>This Panel was charged with analyzing the implication of a Plowshare annex to
                        various forms of nuclear test ban treaties.</p>
                    <p>In the conclusions to follow we interpret the term “annex” to mean an
                        addition to the treaty that would provide for a declaration of purpose of a
                        peaceful uses explosion combined with some kind of approval mechanism and
                        that would permit observers with specified duties and powers to attend the
                        operation. In addition to these general provisions, possible annexes might,
                        for example, restrict the yields available to a Plowshare detonation or
                        require that explosive devices be placed at an early specified time in a
                        warehouse.</p>
                    <p>We have assumed that disclosure of the device would not be permitted to other
                        nuclear-weapons-powers or non-nuclear-weapon-powers. Disclosure to the
                        latter would reveal weapon technology, and disclosure to the former raises
                        serious and difficult problems of national security.</p>
                    <p>The US has agreed to the present limited test ban in the hope of retarding
                        the development and diffusion of military nuclear explosive <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0395"/>technology. In the absence of a Soviet
                        “open society,” a basic policy of the US Government toward any arms control
                        agreement is that it be adequately verified so as to give reasonable
                        assurance that U.S. security interests are protected.</p>
                    <p>While we see little incompatibility between a Plowshare annex and the limited
                        restrictions on weapons development imposed by the present Limited Test Ban
                        Treaty (<gloss target="#t_LTBT1">LTBT</gloss>), the basic question faced by
                        this Panel centered around whether this policy of verification on the one
                        hand and full development and exploitation of nuclear explosions for
                        peaceful purposes on the other are compatible with further tightening of the
                        test ban limitations. Our conclusion is that the answer to this general
                        question is “no,” primarily since even with an extensive observer program it
                        is not possible to assure that the basic data needed for military device
                        development are not being obtained in a given Plowshare operation. However,
                        a more limited Plowshare program excluding excavation may be compatible with
                        a further extension of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT1">LTBT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In further detail we submit the following conclusions:</p>
                    <p>1. To the extent that Plowshare annexes of the types considered by the Panel
                        extend the yields and types of tests permissible under the test ban treaty,
                        they correspondingly open the possibility of some important weapons device
                        development being carried out as part of Plowshare operations, and to an
                        even greater extent in connection with tests for the development of
                        Plowshare explosives.</p>
                    <p>2. It is possible through observers of a Plowshare operation to restrict
                        severely the acquisition of diagnostic data on specialized device outputs or
                        on weapons effects tests, depending upon the number of observers, their
                        tools and their degree and duration of access. Achievement of an adequate
                        observer program may be a serious negotiation problem.</p>
                    <p>3. Plowshare activities under any treaty annex would not make a technical
                        contribution to the proliferation of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear nations
                        unless (a) the annex provided for disclosure of the design of the devices
                        used or for their inspection, (b) the declaration of purpose or the
                        permitted activities of the observers would reveal nuclear device design
                        information, or (c) the annex allowed the development or detonation of
                        nuclear explosives by non-nuclear nations.</p>
                    <p>4. If a Plowshare annex were to be added to the present <gloss target="#t_LTBT1">LTBT</gloss> the military potential of the nations now
                        subscribing to the treaty would not be substantially affected in view of the
                        large flexibility in terms of nuclear tests allowed under the present
                        treaty. Although an excavation program permitted by a Plowshare annex is
                        compatible with the restrictions on weapons development imposed by the
                            <gloss target="#t_LTBT1">LTBT</gloss>, such an annex would set a <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0396"/>serious precedent which could be
                        incompatible with future more restrictive test bans.<note n="4" xml:id="d147fn4">Dr. Heckrotte believes that an evaluation of a
                            Plowshare annex to the <gloss target="#t_LTBT1">LTBT</gloss> as a
                            “serious precedent” involves value judgments of Plowshare and test ban
                            treaties dependent on technical, economic, and political factors, most
                            of which were not within the purview of this Panel. [Footnote in the
                            source text.]</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>5. A Plowshare annex to a seismic threshold test ban treaty (<gloss target="#t_TTBT1">TTBT</gloss>) that permitted an extensive Plowshare
                        program would have the effect of circumventing the yield threshold for
                        weapons development. A Plowshare annex based on a yield limit for explosions
                        in hard rock corresponding to the yield legal in “soft” media under a <gloss target="#t_TTBT1">TTBT</gloss> could permit some underground engineering
                        activity. If the annex permitted in effect a substantial increase in the
                        nuclear test yield, then, for example, the impediment that a threshold test
                        ban provided toward further development of area defense anti-missile
                        warheads could be circumvented. In addition, the annex would leave the
                        option open for Soviet Union developments in lighter-weight strategic
                        warheads of high yield-to-weight ratio that would contribute to a <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> development. Particularly serious is the
                        loophole made possible by a Plowshare annex that would permit a few
                        high-yield weapons development tests that could culminate illegally a series
                        of lower-yield tests carried out legally under a threshold test ban treaty.
                        These “loopholes” provided by the annex could have exceedingly serious
                        consequences for the U.S. deterrent if the Soviet Union chose this means of
                        evasion.</p>
                    <p>6. Under a comprehensive test ban treaty (<gloss target="#t_CTBT1">CTBT</gloss>), a Plowshare annex would in effect decrease the
                        “comprehensiveness” of the treaty by permitting, even in the absence of
                        explicit evasion, continued nuclear device development over a wide range of
                        yields and proof testing of the stockpile, and by maintaining the vitality
                        of nuclear weapons establishments. The ability to maintain the vitality of
                        the weapons establishments of both the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would make the asymmetry through possible Soviet cheating
                        under a <gloss target="#t_CTBT1">CTBT</gloss> less significant than if no
                        Plowshare program were permitted. However, an annex permitting an extensive
                        Plowshare program,<note n="5" xml:id="d147fn5">Dr. Heckrotte believes that
                            some attention should be given to the possibilities of accommodating a
                            limited Plowshare program to more restrictive test bans. This could
                            avoid risks which would be introduced at this time by an annex to more
                            restrictive test bans which permitted an extensive Plowshare program;

                        the Soviet Union and not by the U.S. could have highly damaging military
                        consequences. Such an annex adds extensive evasion possibilities to the
                        limited evasion possibilities available without an annex.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>As a result of the recent private discussions with the Soviets at Geneva, I
                        believe it should be possible to negotiate a non-proliferation agreement
                        which would not interfere with the “<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> Committee”<note n="2" xml:id="d148fn2">See <ref target="#d108fn4">footnote 4, Document 108</ref>.</note> type of
                        nuclear consultative arrangements and which would not require changes in our
                        existing bilateral <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear
                        arrangements. I am transmitting the text of such an agreement.<note n="3" xml:id="d148fn3">Not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Although this draft treaty does not expressly so state, I believe we can only
                        negotiate it if we make clear to the Soviets that we are no longer holding
                        open the option of transferring ownership of nuclear warheads to the Federal
                        Republic of Germany or to an association of states through which the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> obtains joint ownership of nuclear
                        warheads. U.S. law presently prohibits the exercise of this option and both
                        the Administration and Congress have made it clear that they do not favor a
                        change in this legislation.</p>
                    <p>It is, of course, necessary to advise Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> of our thoughts on this matter and it might be
                        advisable to do so prior to his visit at the end of this month. A draft of a
                        possible letter from you to Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> is attached.3</p>

                    <p>I recognize that there are other aspects of our relations with the Federal
                        Republic which make this an unfavorable time to seek German recognition of
                        the realities of the current situation but the passage of time will continue
                        to make it increasingly difficult to clarify this matter. The Germans are
                        undoubtedly aware that it is extremely unlikely that we will ever exercise
                        this option and if we do not clear the matter up and are forced to reiterate
                        at the time of the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> visit<note n="4" xml:id="d148fn4">West German Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Ludwig Erhard</persName> visited the United States

                        States would be in the position to undertake serious negotiations with the

                    <p>I recommend that you authorize the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> to
                        conduct the Cabriolet test, without prejudice to the decision on any
                        subsequent cratering experiment in the Plowshare series which should be
                        evaluated and decided on the merits at the time and in light of experience
                        with Cabriolet.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Problem:</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> is requesting approval to conduct
                        Cabriolet, a 2.7 kiloton nuclear cratering Plowshare experiment, about
                        December 1, 1966, in Nevada. Some radioactive debris will be released into
                        the atmosphere, since the object of the experiment is to produce a crater.
                        There is no health hazard involved, but a detectable amount of radioactive
                        debris can be expected to drift from Nevada and cross the Canadian border.
                        The consensus among proponents and opponents is that there is a 50-50 chance
                        that a certain amount of debris would be picked up and identified by the
                        Canadians as coming from Cabriolet; a much slighter chance that detection
                        would occur when the debris had proceeded beyond Canada.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Pros</p>
                    <p>The main arguments <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> and others have cited
                        for conducting Cabriolet are:</p>
                    <p>It would permit continued U.S. technical progress in nuclear excavation,
                        which we have indications the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is also
                        pursuing.</p>
                    <p>It would help maintain the credibility of the nuclear excavation option for a
                        sea level Panama Isthmus Canal.</p>
                    <p>It would furnish data necessary to support the Atlantic-Pacific Interoceanic
                        Canal Study Commission program, and permit tentative planning of follow-on
                        experiments needed if the Commission's reporting schedule to you is to be
                        kept.</p>
                    <p>It would allay Joint Atomic Energy Committee concern that we seem to have
                        stopped conducting a nuclear excavation program, whereas testimony to the
                        Congress in connection with the Test Ban Treaty, as well as subsequently,
                        indicated that cratering experiments could and would continue to be
                        conducted without violating the Treaty or future amendments thereto.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Cons</p>
                    <p>The main arguments which <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> and others
                        have made against conducting Cabriolet are:</p>
                    <p>There is an even chance that it would expose the U.S. to a charge of
                        violating the Test Ban Treaty by depositing across our border detectable,
                        identifiable radioactive debris from a U.S. test.</p>
                    <p>Consideration of Cabriolet should not be separated from the decision to be
                        made on the overall Plowshare program. To be meaningful, <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0400"/>Cabriolet would have to be followed by
                        other and larger shots, thus increasing still further the probability of
                        charges of Treaty violation.</p>
                    <p>If we are charged publicly with a violation of the Treaty as a result of
                        Cabriolet, it could hamper consideration of other Plowshare peaceful
                        explosion proposals, such as that suggesting the creation of an
                        international entity to offer Plowshare services to the world.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> General Advisory Committee on
                        Disarmament, headed by John McCloy, expressed a formal consensus without
                        dissent on September 13, that it opposed the conduct of Cabriolet, because
                        of “prejudice to non-proliferation” and concern about a conscious violation
                        of the Test Ban Treaty. The Committee includes men such as I.I. Rabi,
                        Herbert York, John Cowles, George Kistiakowsky, Roger Blough and Tray Post.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion:</p>
                    <p>This problem has been considered fully and carefully over a considerable
                        period of time at the highest levels of government. It is my view that the
                        advantages of proceeding with Cabriolet outweigh the risks.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary expressed the hope that the negotiations concerning an
                        agreement for peaceful exploration of outer space could soon be brought to a
                        successful conclusion. We felt that the discussions in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Committee had resulted in considerable
                        progress and that the remaining issues had really narrowed down to one or
                        two specific points.<note n="3" xml:id="d151fn3">The Legal Subcommittee of
                            the U.N. General Assembly's Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer
                            Space met in Geneva, July 12-August 4, and reached agreement on most
                            points of the draft outer space treaty including one arms control
                            measure, namely that “No party will orbit any nuclear or other weapons
                            of mass destruction or station such a weapon on a celestial body.” (<hi rend="italic">U.S. Participation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>: Report by the President to the Congress for the Year
                                1966</hi> (Washington, November 1967), p. 14) The Legal Subcommittee
                            resumed negotiations in New York, September 12, but reached no further
                            agreement before it adjourned September 16.</note> He hoped that our
                        colleagues could resume their discussions here in New York and reach
                        agreement on these remaining points during the present <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly meeting. For our part we
                        were prepared to undertake necessary measures for mutual use of tracking
                        stations as far as US territory was concerned; we could not, however, force
                        third countries to do the same, although we would be willing to do all we
                        could to encourage all countries to take a cooperative position. The
                        Secretary repeated his hope that our negotiators could bring the work they
                        started in Geneva to a successful conclusion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agreed that the outer
                        space negotiations had achieved positive results and that there remained
                        only the one point the Secretary had mentioned. He expressed the view that
                        all countries signing the proposed agreement must assume the same
                        obligations and enjoy the same rights so that the principle of equality be
                        preserved. If however some countries took the position that their
                        “relatives” would be extended privileges while other countries would be
                        denied these same privileges, the principle of equality was violated; what
                        kind of cooperation would that represent? He was surprised that the Soviet
                        proposal of equal rights and obligations had met such a negative response.
                        He was sure that acceptance <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0403"/>of the
                        Soviet proposal would not affect the interests of the United States. He
                        would, therefore, like to see a more positive attitude on the part of the US
                        toward this principle of equality of rights and obligations. Did the
                        Secretary see any possibility of overcoming this difficulty? If so, he
                        thought a treaty could be signed soon. He asked the Secretary to think about
                        this problem; the Soviet Union was not, after all, asking the impossible.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that given this Soviet position we would have to face
                        the very real possibility that the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be the only two countries signing the outer space
                        agreement; other countries might not be willing to sign. Such a Soviet and
                        American signature in itself might represent a positive step; but, as is the
                        case in negotiating “most favored nation” treatment in trade agreements,
                        this was really a matter for bilateral negotiations between the countries
                        involved. The Secretary did not believe that this single issue should stand
                        in the way of signing an outer space treaty.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> repeated that this
                        difficulty would have to be overcome. He agreed that the representatives of
                        the two countries should continue to exchange opinions on this matter, but
                        would hope to see greater objectivity on the part of the United States. If
                        all parties agreed to cooperate on an equal basis there was no problem,
                        otherwise this represented an instance of discrimination against the Soviet
                        Union. He realized that the United States had worked out use of tracking
                        stations with other countries on a bilateral basis, and he did not blame the
                        US for doing so, but this had taken place when an outer space treaty was not
                        even being discussed. Now that such a treaty was under consideration, being
                        a multilateral treaty, new arrangements on a multilateral basis, providing
                        for the principle of equality, were in order.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> commented that we
                        ought to be able to reach agreement; in fact, we had leaned over so far
                        backwards for the purpose of reaching agreement that certain American
                        newspapers had referred to the outer space negotiations as a succession of
                        American retreats. On the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly
                        floor we had said today that we accept the principle on a bilateral
                            basis.<note n="4" xml:id="d151fn4">See <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s statement before the U.N. General Assembly in
                                <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
                            1966</hi>, p. 962.</note> We are willing to work out a bilateral
                        tracking station agreement with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>;
                        we are further willing to include in the preamble of the agreement a
                        statement emphasizing the desirability of signatory countries working out
                        practical arrangements with each other. As a practical matter this was not
                        really a problem which easily lent itself to multilateral solution.
                        Countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Lebanon and Australia wanted to have their
                        own say in this matter. We did not encourage any opposition on the part of
                        any country to working out suitable <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0404"/>technical arrangements with the Soviet Union and with each other; this was
                        not only a matter of equality of rights, but also a matter of very special
                        technical arrangements. Thus, for example, tracking facilities set up for
                        our purposes would not be of help to the Soviet Union, since different
                        equipment would be required. The Ambassador emphasized that this was not a
                        matter of opposition on the part of the US, but rather a matter of other
                        sovereign states wanting to have their own say in the matter. As a matter of
                        fact, some of our friends had told us that the offer we made today had put
                        them in an awkward position. We should have a treaty before either of us
                        achieved a landing on the moon. Later such a treaty would present many more
                        difficulties. It is for this reason that we are willing to include a
                        statement as to the desirability of bilateral arrangements being worked out
                        in the preamble or text of the proposed treaty.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agreed that
                        representatives of the two countries meet and discuss possible solutions;
                        the points of view of both countries had been expressed clearly.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary raised the question of reaching an agreement on
                        non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. He said that we believed very strongly
                        that this problem was most urgent and important. The United States was
                        opposed to the spread of nuclear weapons to countries not presently in
                        possession of such weapons. We also believed that the Soviet Union was
                        opposed to such proliferation. We had never discussed any arrangements
                        providing for the delivery of nuclear weapons into the hands of any other
                        state, neither in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nor anywhere else.
                        This position of the US was really very old. Because of the very nature of
                        these weapons we were determined to prevent their proliferation. We were
                        somewhat puzzled over the difficulty of reaching agreement on this subject;
                        we regarded the problem as being urgent and as one in which the passage of
                        time was making it more and more difficult to come to an effective
                        agreement. This was not really a problem between the United States and the
                        Soviet Union. The true importance of the problem dealt with those states
                        which did not now possess nuclear weapons, but were desirous of moving in
                        the direction of acquiring nuclear capability. As time elapsed more and more
                        obstacles were being raised by such non-nuclear countries. Some such states
                        now say that they would not join in a non-proliferation agreement unless it
                        also provided for agreement between nuclear countries for steps toward
                        nuclear disarmament. While this in itself is desirable it should not be a
                        condition of reaching agreement on non-proliferation. Some countries, such
                        as India, for example, state that they must reserve the right to carry out
                        nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes; well, if you have that capability
                        you also have the capability of using a nuclear bomb. As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> knew, some non-nuclear countries
                        have said that they could not participate in a non-proliferation agreement
                        unless they had nuclear guarantees from nuclear countries in the event of an
                        attack. The Secretary thought that difficulties of this type will keep on
                        growing with time. In the meanwhile, we know that some countries are, as it
                        were, “seven months pregnant.” We thought that toward the end of the Geneva
                        negotiations we had moved toward the <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0406"/>prospect of an agreement between our two countries.<note n="3" xml:id="d152fn3">The Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee met in Geneva
                            June 14-August 25.</note> At one of the last meetings Ambassador Roschin
                        had said that the transfer of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear countries was
                        the real heart of the matter. We agree that this is so. In the past a
                        variety of issues had been injected into the negotiations which had nothing
                        whatever to do with non-proliferation. But in the recent discussion between
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> and Amb. Roschin, the
                        Secretary felt that there was a possibility of moving toward an
                            agreement.<note n="4" xml:id="d152fn4">The discussions between <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> and Roschin have not been
                            further identified.</note> He wanted to emphasize the urgency and the
                        danger involved in the time factor. A non-proliferation agreement was
                        clearly in the interest of both countries; in this respect they had common
                        interests. Perhaps a part of the difficulty consisted in both countries
                        having become “frozen” to the texts of the proposed agreement; perhaps we
                        could find new language to close the gap, which would offer the possibility
                        of reaching agreement. We have not discussed this matter with our allies and
                        any contacts between the two countries would have to be carried on on the
                        basis of complete discretion; otherwise nothing could be accomplished. The
                        Secretary would be glad to hear from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> whether he thought Ambassadors Roschin and <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> could find some new language which
                        might open the door to agreement. He was greatly concerned over the
                        increasing difficulties presented by long delay in reaching agreement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that
                        non-proliferation was an old question, which had been discussed at great
                        length, and yet, if the Secretary had not raised it at this meeting, he
                        would have done so himself because of its importance and because it
                        concerned all countries, nuclear as well as non-nuclear. We had already lost
                        a great deal of time with detrimental consequences. Thus, for example, just
                        one year ago the foreign minister of India had discussed non-proliferation
                        matters in a very timid manner, whereas today India was taking a stronger
                            position;<note n="5" xml:id="d152fn5">The discussion in 1965 by Indian
                            Foreign Minister Sardar Swaran Singh and the current Indian position on
                            nonproliferation have not been further identified.</note> the Secretary
                        said he had noted the same thing. Later this point of view would become even
                        more widespread and this could also be seen in the 18-Nation Disarmament
                        Committee. Not only India, but other states also are beginning to tie
                        non-proliferation to other questions such as halting the production of
                        fissionable material, etc. The Secretary knew that if non-proliferation was
                        tied to such matters there might not be any treaty at all. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wondered whether India and others
                        proposing such tie-ins were serious or not, and whether a treaty with broad
                        participation would be possible in view of such attitudes. He, too,
                        therefore believed that there was no time to be lost in reaching agreement.
                        As concerns the Soviet Government, <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0407"/>it was ready to sign a treaty banning direct and indirect proliferation of
                        nuclear weapons. He wanted to ask the question very clearly, whether the US
                        was ready to say so in the treaty. He defined what he meant by saying that
                        the treaty must contain a prohibition against non-nuclear countries
                        producing or receiving nuclear weapons directly or indirectly. Nuclear
                        countries must be forbidden to transfer nuclear weapons into the national
                        hands of any non-nuclear country, directly or indirectly. He added that the
                        Secretary knew what he meant by the word “indirectly.” He meant by that
                        transfer of nuclear weapons through an alliance. If the treaty could contain
                        such a prohibition, he would think that the major part of the difficulties
                        was already behind us. It was true that there were some other points to be
                        discussed also, but he did not now want to do so, they could be discussed
                        later. He asked the Secretary to clarify the US position on these points and
                        added that these questions should not be regarded as a matter in which one
                        country would lose something while another gained, since both countries were
                        equally interested in closing the door to nuclear proliferation. The problem
                        was far too serious for considerations of tactics or prestige to be given
                        any importance at all. This crucial problem affected the interests of
                        nuclear and non-nuclear states alike.</p>
                    <p>In reply the Secretary stated categorically that as far as the United States
                        was concerned, we shall not transfer nuclear weapons to non-nuclear
                        countries; we shall not assist any non-nuclear country to develop or fire
                        nuclear weapons; American nuclear weapons would be fired at the command of
                        the President of the United States exclusively. If the United States joined
                        in an alliance arrangement, nuclear weapons would still be fired only at the
                        command of the President of the United States. If the Secretary understood
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s question concerning the
                        transfer of nuclear weapons correctly, his answer was an unqualified yes,
                        and Ambassadors Roschin and <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>
                        could discuss the language with a view to eliminating any possible hidden
                        misunderstanding. He again emphasized the point that if this was merely a
                        question between our two countries, we would not need a treaty to prevent
                        the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The very essence of the situation made
                        it clear that both countries must be opposed to the appearance of nuclear
                        powers; even the present five were too many. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> interrupted to say that even one was one too many.
                        The Secretary agreed and blessed Bernard Baruch for having seen this fact in
                        his time.<note n="6" xml:id="d152fn6">See <ref target="#d97fn5">footnote 5,
                                Document 97</ref>.</note> He said that if the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could reach agreement on a treaty, while
                        they would still be unable to force other countries to sign it, they would
                        be in a much better position to influence them to do so. He pointed out that
                        many of the arguments used by non-nuclear countries against
                        non-proliferation <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0408"/>were merely
                        contrived pretexts, designed to hold their positions open for future
                        negotiating purposes. He did not accept such arguments as genuine. The
                        Secretary went on to say that he could not see why our two countries could
                        not agree about the heart of the matter and then put their heads together to
                        see what could be done to make other countries, which were presently merely
                        “flirting,” sign the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked for
                        clarification. The Secretary had said that without the US Government,
                        indeed, without orders from the President of the United States personally,
                        American nuclear weapons could not be fired. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that this was not the question here, although
                        this, too, raised some other questions he would prefer to leave for another
                        occasion. The main problem was to find out where we now stood. The Soviet
                        Union proposed that the treaty prohibit non-nuclear countries from
                        manufacturing and receiving into their national hands nuclear weapons from
                        nuclear countries and further that they not be given access to nuclear
                        weapons through blocs, alliances or military organizations. Conversely
                        nuclear countries were to be forbidden to transfer nuclear weapons into the
                        national hands of non-nuclear countries or to grant non-nuclear countries
                        access to nuclear weapons through blocs, alliances or military
                        organizations. Did the Secretary agree that these two conditions must be
                        reflected in a non-proliferation treaty, or not? It seemed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that these two conditions,
                        concerning direct and indirect transfer must be included in such a treaty.
                        He wanted to ascertain that position of the United States in this respect at
                        the present time. He knew that the US was interested in a non-proliferation
                        treaty and he was sure the Secretary also knew that the Soviet Union was
                        interested in it. He was only trying to tie what the Secretary had said to
                        the language of the proposed treaty.</p>
                    <p>In reply the Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to go directly to the heart of the matter and to deal
                        with it clearly. Unfortunately during the past two or three years a great
                        deal of theology had accumulated around the use of certain terms, such as
                        “give, dispose of, turn over to, contribute to the ability of non-nuclear
                        powers to obtain the technology required” etc. The situation, on the other
                        hand, was very clear. We should try to return to language which would cut
                        through words and misunderstandings. We ought to see if such language could
                        be found.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he did not
                        believe the difficulty to be a matter of theology or semantics only. He
                        would ask the question in a different way. There had been plans in existence
                        for the creation of a multilateral nuclear force or an Atlantic nuclear
                        force, mixed manning of ships bearing nuclear weapons, etc. The Soviet Union
                        regarded all such forces as being a form of access to nuclear weapons by
                        non-nuclear powers. The Secretary was surely better informed than he as to
                        the plans and status of such forces, but all of them, in the Soviet view,
                        represented access of non-nuclear <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0409"/>countries to nuclear weapons. The United States maintained that this was
                        not the case, that you did not grant the Federal Republic of Germany or any
                        other country access to nuclear weapons. Therefore he now asked whether
                        these plans are still in existence or not, whether any plans the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> considered to represent access are under
                        consideration. Since the Secretary did not keep the Soviet Union informed of
                        such plans and since the press also was not informed, he did not know. If
                        there were no such plans in existence and if the United States was willing
                        to accept a ban on direct and indirect proliferation, the Soviet Union would
                        be fully satisfied and by these provisions in the treaty all loopholes would
                        have been closed. It was this question that needed to be clarified. It was
                        on this question that we stumbled two or three years ago and we have not
                        been able to move ahead since. The Soviet Union was convinced that the
                        United States would not lose by a non-proliferation agreement and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was willing to believe
                        that the US was not interested in proliferation and that it did not dispute
                        the Soviet Union's interest in reaching a non-proliferation agreement. Why,
                        then, could not a way be found to do so?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that the US could not make the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> the 16th member of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>

                        than the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could admit the US with veto
                        power to the Warsaw Pact. What the two countries could agree to was a clear
                        and precise ban on the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The United States
                        was willing to sign an agreement not to transfer nuclear weapons into the
                        control of non-nuclear countries, not to put any non-nuclear country in a
                        position to fire nuclear weapons, to give assurances that such American
                        weapons would be fired only at the order of the President of the United
                        States, and not to help any other country acquire the technology required to
                        produce nuclear weapons or to assist any other country in firing them; we
                        had demonstrated our good faith in this respect by our attitude to France's
                        nuclear tests in the Pacific. The Secretary suggested that between now and
                        the meeting scheduled for Saturday evening (September 24, 1966)<note n="7" xml:id="d152fn7">For the record of the <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>

                        not mentioned further talks with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        to our allies at Geneva simply because we did not then think that we had
                        come close enough to resolving the difficulties. If anything needed to be
                        said now it would only be that the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were discussing the very heart of the problem.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> added that the
                        Soviet Union had apparently been haunted by the specter of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>; yet, we had no intention of giving the
                        Germans access to nuclear weapons for this would be contrary to <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0410"/>the philosophy the US had been guided by
                        for the past twenty years, namely that only we had the right to fire
                        American nuclear weapons. We have no intention to give up this national
                        control and we would not help any non-nuclear country obtain nuclear
                        weapons, for we believe it to be contrary to our interest to increase the
                        number of nuclear powers. The matter of reaching agreement on
                        non-proliferation is most urgent, for the price of obtaining other
                        countries' consent keeps on going up day to day. Now may very well be our
                        last chance to work out an agreement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> restated his position to
                        the effect that a general statement of intentions, without more precise
                        definition, concrete obligations, would lead to a variety of interpretations
                        of a specific act on the part of a signatory country. The US would tend to
                        interpret its own acts one way and the Soviet Union another, and vice versa.
                        We would then find ourselves in a trap and such a treaty would have been
                        stillborn. Therefore it was not enough to prohibit just in a general way the
                        proliferation of nuclear weapons. It would also be necessary to define
                        channels, forms, concepts, etc. We should attempt to put this more precisely
                        in the text of the treaty. This is a problem, which must be solved, no
                        matter who puts their heads together.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary proposed that this question be considered again by looking at
                        some language to be drafted before the meeting Saturday evening and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agreed.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary further proposed that the press merely be told that some
                        preliminary discussions on questions of mutual interest had been held at the
                        present meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                    agreed.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Non-Proliferation</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he
                        would like to take the present opportunity to express his thoughts on
                        non-proliferation in the most precise words and asked that both sides be
                        outspoken in order to clarify as accurately as possible whether or not a
                        sound foundation for a non-proliferation treaty existed. Personally, he did
                        note a certain rapprochement between the two positions. If this was indeed
                        the case, he suggested that both sides join in a concerted effort to work
                        out appropriate language for a treaty. After the discussion which had been
                        held during the past two days his representatives had informed him of such
                        rapprochement, but it still remained unclear how to express this in mutually
                        acceptable language. He wanted to repeat what he had said many times, <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0412"/>namely that we should not sign a
                        treaty which could be open to misinterpretation, for, after all, after its
                        signing the principals would go their separate ways to Washington and Moscow
                        and would not be in a position to resolve differing interpretations. For
                        this reason it was not enough to word the treaty in general language only,
                        we had to be more precise so as to avoid misinterpretations. In addition, it
                        seemed to him that both sides must try to put aside purely diplomatic
                        formulations; the interests of both countries as well as of others, indeed
                        of the entire world were involved, and this in itself precluded the signing
                        of a non-proliferation treaty which was not worded precisely and accurately.
                        He emphasized once again that he hoped both sides would be frank and
                        outspoken in their search for agreement.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary wanted to comment briefly on the problem as he saw it. He was
                        going to be frank and would rely on the Soviet side's complete discretion.
                        First, he wanted the Foreign Minister to understand that if we would be able
                        to find mutually acceptable language, we would have to consult our allies
                        before we said finally that we agreed. The Secretary therefore reserved the
                        right to carry on such consultations. Secondly, he felt that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was seriously underestimating the
                        depth and the strength of our interest in non-proliferation of nuclear
                        weapons, and also the depth and the strength of the opposition of certain
                        countries to such a treaty. Yet, it was a matter of quite harsh and selfish
                        American policy, our purely national policy, that caused us utterly to
                        oppose any arrangement which would involve our providing nuclear weapons to
                        other countries. Further, within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> there
                        was strong opposition to providing the FRG with an independent nuclear
                        capability. We knew very well that Soviet policy was frequently affected by
                        memories of World War II as far as the Germans were concerned. But, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> must also realize that in
                        the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance many other countries also
                        have dark memories of World War II—France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Great
                        Britain and others. Thus there were strong reasons in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> against the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> receiving nuclear weapons. Thirdly, the Secretary wanted Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to know that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was utterly serious in
                        his determination to resolve this question. We had no doubt that US and
                        Soviet policy on non-proliferation was truly identical. In the past the
                        Soviet Union had raised some issues in connection with non-proliferation,
                        which really were quite extraneous and had nothing to do with
                        non-proliferation. But he thought that if we now concentrated on the heart
                        of the matter it should not be impossible to find the language which would
                        express the common policy of the two sides. He quite agreed that it was
                        important not to use language which would conceal the true points of view;
                        on our side a treaty would be open to examination by the Senate, indeed it
                        would be open to very broad public examination, so that all our agreements
                        with the Soviet Union would inevitably become public. The Secretary did <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0413"/>believe that some progress had been
                        made during the past days and weeks, undoubtedly because both sides
                        recognized the urgency of the time factor. The longer we delayed the more
                        difficult it would become to get other countries to join in the treaty. The
                        Secretary was not thinking so much of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in this respect as of other non-nuclear-weapon states such as
                        Japan, India, Israel and others. It was important and urgent to act now,
                        before the horse escaped the stable; then it would be too late to close the
                        door.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary urged Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> not to
                        worry about the ghosts of the future but rather to help us now draft a
                        treaty. We were opposed to furnishing nuclear weapons or nuclear information
                        to any country which was not now a nuclear-weapon state. We thought that the
                        Soviet side was equally opposed to this. The Secretary hoped that we could
                        find simple language to express this serious interest of both sides without
                        trying to write into the treaty provisions that would cover every possible
                        future contingency, however remote. He thought that during the last two days
                        we had exchanged language which would help us move closer together. He had
                        had no chance to consult with the President since his last meeting with Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> because the President was
                        in Texas. But he knew of the President's serious concern with the urgency of
                        the matter. He was concerned that it might be too late unless we took quick
                        action to induce other governments which were active in a nuclear direction
                        to join in the treaty, governments which neither we nor the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could control. He therefore hoped that we
                        could work this out while Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        was still here. Each of us would probably have some difficulties with our
                        respective allies, and both of us with countries not in either alliance;
                        but, the very first step had to be for both of us to reach agreement. If we
                        concentrated on the essence of the matter and left aside considerations
                        which were not realistic we could move ahead. We should deal with this
                        essence without any delay because of theoretical considerations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> referred to the three
                        alternative versions worked out by the negotiators this afternoon and asked
                        for clarification in answer to one specific question. Could we have
                        agreement that no nuclear-weapon power would transfer nuclear weapons, etc.,
                        directly or indirectly to any non-nuclear-weapon state individually or by
                        virtue of such non-nuclear-weapon state's membership or partnership in a
                        grouping of states, alliance or bloc? This question, in his view, had not
                        been answered so far, although if he understood the Secretary correctly both
                        countries were thinking in the same direction. How could it then be possible
                        that we could not reach agreement? There should be no possibility of a 50-50
                        chance of misinterpretation. He proposed that we now discuss the situation
                        from this angle. If we agreed on the content of the treaty, then our
                        representatives could put this down on paper; after all, the purpose of <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0414"/>language was to express thoughts
                        and ideas and agreements precisely. It did not matter for the purpose of
                        this discussion whether or not the Soviet Union underestimated one thing or
                        another; we should not be concerned with the past. As for his side, he took
                        careful note of the Secretary's statement concerning the determination of
                        the United States to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that it seemed to him that we did not have agreement on
                        99% of the problem. This concerned three very simple propositions: 1) that
                        we not transfer nuclear weapons to any non-nuclear country directly or
                        indirectly; 2) that we not assist any non-nuclear-weapon state become a
                        nuclear power in any possible way; 3) that we never delegate the right to
                        fire US nuclear weapons to anyone else. It seemed to the Secretary that the
                        controversy over the remaining 1% was really just a controversy over
                        concepts. For example, the notion of ownership seemed to cause some
                        difficulty. The non-nuclear-weapon states in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> were, after all, the targets of Soviet nuclear weapons; it
                        could very well be that some non-nuclear state in the alliance would make a
                        financial contribution toward the maintenance of American nuclear weapons on
                        its territory. The Soviet Union might well object to this, but in reality
                        this had nothing to do with non-proliferation. Another such concept was
                        represented by the word “control.” We could not tell our allies that they
                        would have no voice in any decision to go to war. The concept of access was
                        another difficulty. If, however, we would concentrate on these three simple
                        ideas: not to transfer nuclear weapons, not to provide nuclear-weapon
                        technology to any non-nuclear state, not to delegate the firing of nuclear
                        weapons, then we did really have 99% agreement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he had two remarks to
                        make concerning the Secretary's statement. When the Secretary said that
                        allies must participate in any decision to go to war he raised a question
                        which would lead the discussion very far afield. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had not raised this question,
                        although he might well return to it later. Secondly, he, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, had asked the question concerning
                        access of non-nuclear-weapon states to nuclear weapons in their capacity of
                        participants or members in a group of states or an alliance. This was not
                        just a question he was raising by himself, rather it was a question posed by
                        life itself. Suppose that agreement were reached concerning transfer of
                        nuclear weapons into the national hands of a non-nuclear-weapon state, the
                        question concerning transfer to an alliance which included both
                        nuclear-weapon states and non-nuclear-weapon states still remained
                        unanswered. Would in such a case non-nuclear-weapon states participate in
                        the decisions of the alliance, in ownership, control and use of nuclear
                        weapons, as members of the alliance? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thought they should not so participate. This was what he
                        meant by using the word “indirect.”</p>
                    <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0415"/>
                    <p>The Secretary asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>
                        to clarify the three alternative drafts of Article I of the proposed treaty.
                        Was the first alternative based upon the suggestion of the Russian
                        colleagues?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said that both sides
                        had contributed to it. Inasmuch as the concept of “right to fire” required
                        further qualification from the American point of view (i.e. “except at the
                        direct orders of the President of the United States”) and the concept of
                        “access” had raised difficulties, both concepts had been struck from the
                        draft of Article I. The Soviet side had suggested adding the words “control
                        over” and we had accepted this as useful. This afternoon the Soviet
                        negotiators had presented a second alternative which included a prohibition
                        against transfer of nuclear weapons to military alliances or groups of
                        states, instead of the former formulation “through military alliances or
                        groups of states.” We had taken the position that, while this provision
                        would be in full accord with our national legislation, which we had no
                        intention of amending, it would at this moment in history be politically
                        unwise to word it just that way. A third alternative draft had then been
                        suggested, which would not specify the possible recipient, but would merely
                        use the words “to any recipient whatsoever.” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> thought that this alternative
                        answered everything.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he had seen all
                        three alternative drafts and that what he had just said had been in answer
                        to them. To Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s
                        question as to what he objected to specifically in alternative three, he
                        replied that all the American versions spoke of groups and alliances as mere
                        transmitters of nuclear weapons or nuclear technology instead of prohibiting
                        ownership, control and disposal of nuclear weapons by non-nuclear-weapon
                        states individually as well as in their capacity of participants in groups
                        or alliances. Supposing that the American side did not attach any great
                        importance to these points; it should, however, consider the fact that the
                        Soviet side did think them important and therefore attempt to find language
                        to close the door to all possible loopholes as they were seen by the Soviet
                        side.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> replied that he
                        thought the third alternative draft accomplished exactly that by speaking of
                        “any recipient whatsoever.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> pointed out that we were
                        discussing a situation in the absence of a state of war. If war did occur,
                        then, of course, all bets were off. We were therefore only speaking of
                        conditions in times of peace, up to the beginning of a war which he
                        sincerely hoped would never occur. Secondly, we were not discussing the
                        question of decisions to go to war. We could not in our alliances reserve
                        this right exclusively to ourselves. It would have to be a decision in which
                        all allies would participate, including, of course, the United States.</p>
                    <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0416"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that these were
                        political considerations, while we were here discussing nuclear weapons as
                        such.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out that the more we were talking about the heart of
                        the matter, that is the physical weapons themselves, the more it became
                        evident that we were in agreement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> added that the formulation
                        “to any recipient whatsoever” would also be unacceptable because it appeared
                        to prohibit transfer to oneself. It would certainly be open to at least two
                        interpretations.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked for clarification by asking the question whether, in the
                        Soviet view, the three Polaris submarines we had assigned to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would constitute a violation of a
                        non-proliferation treaty if such treaty were now in force.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he did not know and
                        would ask the same question of the Secretary. In any case this concerned
                        existing arrangements and the present was not yet the time to discuss such
                        existing arrangements. It seemed to him that this begged the question as to
                        whether these subs were an American force or part of a joint force. He
                        restated his question concerning nuclear weapons in national hands of
                        non-nuclear-weapon states, either directly or because of their participation
                        in an alliance. He felt this was a simple question. If the United States
                        intended to create a joint force, then it should say so now and he would
                        know where he stood; the US position would then be clear to him. If no such
                        intention existed, and it was his impression that it did not exist, then
                        there should be no obstacle to working out a treaty.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was
                        quite right in believing that we had no intention to give nuclear weapons to
                        non-nuclear-weapon states, either directly or indirectly through their
                        membership in alliances. However, we could not say to our allies that the
                        question of war was none of their business; after all, they were sitting on
                        the targets, they were very much involved. We had never had the slightest
                        idea of transferring nuclear weapons and do not now intend to do so.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> still felt that there was
                        a serious misunderstanding. It was not only a question of transferring
                        nuclear weapons into the national hands of non-nuclear-weapon states,
                        directly or through alliances, but also a question of not granting access to
                        nuclear weapons to non-nuclear-weapon states in their capacity of
                        participants in groups or alliances. The United States was a nuclear-weapon
                        power and would remain a nuclear-weapon power regardless of a
                        non-proliferation treaty, but the question of access remained unsolved. At
                        this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> used three
                        teacups to illustrate this point visually.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary reminded Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        that he had intended to comment on the question of consultation.</p>
                    <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0417"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he was not
                        raising the question of consultation in connection with a non-proliferation
                        treaty. In the Soviet view the treaty should state that which is to be
                        prohibited rather than that which is to be allowed; although he could draw
                        certain conclusions from the Secretary's statement concerning the
                        participation of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in any decision to
                        go to war.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that considering the problem for the physical weapons
                        point of view only seemed to simplify it. Here we were dealing with the
                        question of who had such weapons, who could fire them, who could manufacture
                        them, who had nuclear technology, etc. He could not see why it should be so
                        difficult to find appropriate expressions to cover these points. When we
                        said “directly or indirectly,” in our minds we were 100% clear as to what
                        this meant. Somehow we ought to be able to put this down on paper.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied once again that
                        this was open to a 50-50 interpretation. Each side would place its own
                        interpretation on such wording. He could not dispute the right of the United
                        States to interpret such language in its own interests, and naturally other
                        countries would be guided by their particular interests as well. We were
                        dealing with two kinds of entities—national entities and groups or alliances
                        or blocs.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary reminded Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        that he had asked for a frank discussion. He therefore hoped Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would not mind the following. We
                        assumed that in the Warsaw Pact the Soviet Union retained for itself the
                        decision to use nuclear weapons, although non-nuclear-weapon members of the
                        Warsaw Pact had received nuclear vehicles.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to know if this was
                        a question. The Soviet Union had not in the past and is not now taking any
                        steps leading to a proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that in the NATO alliance we retained complete control
                        over the firing of U.S. nuclear weapons. He wanted to ask the Foreign
                        Minister a frank question. We do say to our allies that even though we
                        retain the final decision they must be consulted in any group discussion in
                        which we are, of course, a party. Perhaps Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did not care for this arrangement to become known to
                        his Warsaw Pact partners, who then might ask him for the same kind of thing.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the Secretary had
                        raised two questions. One of these is political. We had agreed to discuss
                        only the question of the physical nuclear weapons themselves. He preferred
                        not to discuss the other question. Secondly, it seemed to him that the
                        Secretary had implied that the question of proliferation and the question of
                        the right to fire were not related. And yet, when plans for mixed manned
                        ships, the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>, were considered in the past, the Secretary
                        had made that distinction. He suggested that question be set aside. If the
                        Secretary was opposed to proliferation to non-nuclear-weapon states as
                        national entities <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0418"/>and as members of
                        groups and alliances, then there should be no difficulty. Reservation of the
                        right to fire appeared to point in this direction.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that this reservation applied to American nuclear
                        weapons only; General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had
                        said that he would not give us control over his nuclear weapons. The
                        Secretary said it seemed to him that we had usefully excluded three
                        questions: 1) the situation in the event that war occurs; 2) political
                        decision as to whether or not war does occur; and 3) political relationships
                        among states. Concerning the physical nuclear weapons themselves it appeared
                        to him we were in agreement. The problem was to find the right language to
                        express this agreement without involving extraneous matters. The three
                        latest drafts seemed to have narrowed the gap. Apparently the formulations
                        tried in the last 48 hours had come fairly close but had not as yet
                        satisfied both sides completely. He hoped that the answer could be found
                        while the Minister was still in this country. We did not envisage and had
                        never discussed a situation in which American nuclear weapons ceased to be
                        American nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> suggested that the
                        representatives of the two sides get together again to continue their search
                        tomorrow or Monday.<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3">No record of conversation on
                            September 25 or Monday, September 26, has been found, but a memorandum

                            on the most substantive article of the draft treaty, although the Soviet

                    <p>I've had a brief rundown by classified telephone of the <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> conversation this morning. A cable will be coming
                        later in the day.<note n="2" xml:id="d154fn2">Not further identified.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>There were no significant Soviet reactions except that at the close of the
                        conversation <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> referred to the
                        outer space treaty as an hors d'oeuvre which depended on “getting a better
                        picture of the main meal.” This is interpreted to mean in New York Soviet
                        unwillingness to agree to a space treaty without some progress on
                        non-proliferation and possibly Vietnam.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Outer Space Treaty</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> explained the U.S.
                        was eager to reach agreement on a treaty as evidence of a mutual desire for
                        good relationships. He mentioned the problem of equal facilities and
                        expressed willingness to shift from the preamble to an operative paragraph a
                        provision whereby the parties would agree to consider granting of
                        facilities. He did not give <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        specific language. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> indicated
                        no real awareness of details but commented this did not get over the problem
                        of discrimination from the Soviet point of view and the U.S. should “show
                        more imagination.”</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of Vietnam.]</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Non-Proliferation Treaty</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> noted that this
                        was something <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would wish to
                        discuss with the President and therefore he would not go into any detail. He
                        told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that the President had
                        said to him yesterday that he would not go along with any change in U.S. law
                        that would remove the need for his approval for firing of any nuclear
                        weapons. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> responded that
                        firing was not the whole problem. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> added that the President had also said he would not go
                        along with arrangements where others could tell him where or when the U.S.
                        would employ nuclear weapons. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        just nodded. He asked whether <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0420"/>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> was telling him
                        the U.S. was really anxious to conclude a non-proliferation treaty.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> said “yes.” <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> repeated it would have to be a
                        treaty which avoided any dissemination through the structure of an alliance.</p>

                            issues in the negotiation of an Outer Space Treaty. (Ibid.) On the same

                                <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s reactions to the
                            Soviet proposals in part as follows: “Morozov gave clear impression of
                            Soviet readiness to proceed to reach agreement speedily on outer space
                            treaty without reference to subjects lying outside space field. He
                            indicated continuing desire to finish the job before outer space item is
                            taken up in First Committee and Assembly.” (Ibid.) <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s consultation with the
                            friendly fifteen (less Argentina, Australia, Iran, Lebanon, and Sweden)
                            is reported in telegram 1264 from <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>,
                            October 5. (Ibid.)</note> In summary, a few problems still remain,
                        although the new Soviet proposals show significant movement towards a
                        workable compromise.</p>
                    <p>With respect to specific provisions, the Soviets have accepted our compromise
                        proposal on access to installations on celestial bodies. They have made only
                        very minor changes in our proposal for reporting activities on celestial
                        bodies, another major point. They have significantly qualified their request
                        for third countries to grant tracking facilities to all parties on an equal
                        basis, by recognizing that the actual tracking station <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0421"/>arrangement has to evolve from bilateral
                        negotiations between the countries concerned. The original Soviet demand
                        caused concern to our friends, and we have asked them to seek instructions
                        from their governments on the latest Soviet offer.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> will be meeting at
                        3 p.m. today with the Soviet Representative to give him our preliminary
                        assessment of the new proposals.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>“On September twelfth this year, there took place an ejection of radioactive
                        products into the atmosphere during the conduct of an underground test of a
                        nuclear weapon at the American proving ground in the State of Nevada.<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">The U.S. Government reported the “accidental

                        that this is already the ninth case of ejection of radioactive materials in
                        the conduct of American underground tests of nuclear weapons since the
                        conclusion of the Moscow treaty banning nuclear weapon tests in the
                        atmosphere, in outer space and under water.</p>
                    <p>“Since such ejection of radioactive materials contradicts the spirit of the
                        Moscow treaty banning nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, in outer space
                        and under water, the Soviet side expects that the American <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0422"/>side will present necessary explanations
                        concerning the facts of the appearance of radioactive materials in the
                        atmosphere as a result of these tests and will take precautionary measures
                        in order that compliance with the terms of the treaty will be duly ensured.”</p>
                    <p>I inquired whether it was considered that any atomic debris had gone outside
                        the borders of the United States. After checking his notes, he observed that
                        this aspect was not mentioned.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he would like to
                        raise the question of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. He had had an
                        exchange of views with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d157fn2">
                            <ref target="#d153">Document 153</ref>.</note> The Soviet Union
                        considered that every lost day made the problem more difficult. They
                        believed that every nation in the world was interested in achieving an
                        agreement on this subject. He said that every government had its advisers
                        and there were perhaps some that thought the Soviet Union was not interested
                        in signing such an agreement, but he urged the President not to believe
                        this. The Soviet Union was ready to sign an agreement in two weeks when an
                        agreed text was achieved. The Soviet position was that nuclear weapons must
                        not fall into individual national control of non-nuclear powers or into the
                        collective hands of any grouping that included non-nuclear powers. He would
                        like to have <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0423"/>the President's views
                        on this subject and said that if the conditions he had outlined could be
                        met, the Soviet Union was prepared to conclude an agreement and perhaps the
                        Foreign Ministers might meet before the end of the year, perhaps at Geneva
                        for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>The President, in referring to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s remark about advisers, said that there were no two men
                        in which he had more trust than Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>. He said when they speak, they have my complete
                        confidence and he said that sometimes he thought he trusted them more than
                        he trusted himself. He said that he had been happy that we appeared to be on
                        the verge of reaching an agreement on civil aviation and he would do all he
                        could to conclude the Consular agreement. He appreciated the Soviet handling
                        of the fisheries question. He was also interested in dealing with the
                        question of trade, and settling other problems.</p>
                    <p>The President said that we had a law in this country which said we could not
                        transfer the power of decision to fire nuclear weapons to anyone else.<note n="3" xml:id="d157fn3">Reference presumably is to Section 92 of the
                            Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; 42 <gloss target="#t_USC1">USC</gloss> 2122.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> could be sure that only the President of the United
                        States would exercise power over nuclear weapons. He presumed that the
                        Soviet Government could give a similar assurance, but he did not ask the
                        Soviet Union to tear up the Warsaw Pact and to have no allies. He did not
                        see why we could not get our pencils out and work out an agreement.
                        Sometimes he thought that we did not understand each other.</p>
                    <p>The President concluded the discussion by saying that no country was more
                        against the proliferation of nuclear weapons than the United States.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary began the conversation by pointing out that each side has a
                        legitimate interest in insuring that nuclear powers do not transfer nuclear
                        weapons to non-nuclear powers. This is the heart of the proliferation
                        problem. If we are prepared to commit ourselves not to transfer nuclear
                        weapons into the hands of non-nuclear powers—as we are—then the Secretary
                        felt that this should meet the Soviet concern. What we cannot agree to is
                        the proposition that we consent to an arrangement which in effect would
                        amount to our telling our allies that the nuclear problem is none of their
                        business. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> must understand
                        that this would be an absolutely untenable position for us and one which
                        would not be understood or supported by our allies since they, after all,
                        are targeted by Soviet nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the Soviet position
                        on non-proliferation is to provide for an agreement which would insure that
                        nuclear powers not transfer nuclear weapons to non-nuclear states or to an
                        alliance to which such states belong.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he wishes to be very frank with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> so that each side would understand
                        clearly what was in the other's mind. We know and we can assure the Soviets
                        that we will not transfer nuclear weapons to any non-nuclear state—ever—or
                        to any group of non-nuclear states. By his insistence on language which
                        would cover the alliance concept, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> seemed to take a position which would result in the
                        erection of a barrier between ourselves and our allies. It was this that we
                        could not accept.</p>
                    <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0425"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that this was not the
                        Soviet intention.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary went on to say that we have never discussed any nuclear sharing
                        arrangements in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> that we would not be
                        happy to see applied to the Warsaw Pact. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> must understand that we are obliged in our nuclear
                        planning to take into account the views of our allies just as the Soviets
                        would take into account the views of their allies.<note n="2" xml:id="d158fn2">At this point the <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>
                            Bureau typist of this memorandum inadvertently omitted the following
                            paragraph: “<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> pointed out
                            that the Soviets do not suggest that a treaty should include a provision
                            banning consultation. This was a separate matter to which he might wish
                            to return, but he did not intend to discuss it in connection with the
                            treaty.” (Memorandum from Malcolm Toon (<gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_SOV1">SOV</gloss>) to <persName corresp="#p_WJP1">John Walsh</persName> (<gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss>), October 18, cleared by <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_AL1">AL</gloss>); Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SSI1">S/S-I</gloss> Files: Lot 79 <gloss target="#t_D1">D</gloss> 246, US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Officials,

                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary felt that we are perhaps not far apart on basic policy and that
                        the problem might be simply a matter of language. One answer to the problem
                        might be simply to state that we would not transfer nuclear weapons out of
                        our hands without concerning ourselves with the question of “to whom.” An
                        alternative solution might be to adopt Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s suggestion of adding “to any recipient whatsoever.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this would not be
                        adequate since the formula did not preclude the possibility of transfer into
                        “collective” hands. To meet this point the wording should provide for a ban
                        on transfer “individually or collectively.” While the Soviets are prepared
                        to accept the proposition that the United Stares intends to retain control
                        and possession of its nuclear weapons there is always the possibility that
                        such control and possession might be shared with others. It is this point
                        that concerns the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that if the Soviets should be worried about the
                        possibility that some day a United States nuclear weapon might be fired by a
                        German soldier on order of a German government, and without U.S. consent, he
                        could assure <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that this would
                        and could never happen. We are of course not talking about a condition of
                        war.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> assured the Secretary that
                        the Soviet Union is prepared to accept that this is the intention of the
                        United States Government. The Soviet view is, however, that the guarantee
                        should be absolute; the Soviets may be sure of United States intentions but
                        they do not have the same confidence with regard to the intentions of
                        others.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we seemed to be agreed on the heart of the matter—on
                        the basic concept of non-proliferation. Our trouble is that we can't seem to
                        find language that does not involve what we regard as extraneous matters. It
                        is important to recognize that the psychological and political implications
                        of language we should adopt must be taken into account if we are not to
                        jeopardize our alliance relationships. We <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0426"/>cannot agree to any wording which would amount to informing
                        our allies that their nuclear defense is none of their business.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> pointed out that the West
                        Germans have never asked us to transfer possession of or surrender our
                        authority to fire nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this may be true but
                        there has been much talk in the past of plans for the creation of joint
                        nuclear forces such as <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>. Such plans if realized would accord a
                        participating role to the West Germans, and it is this that concerns the
                        Soviets. It is not the prospect of a German “voice” or other “voices” in
                        nuclear defense planning which bothers the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that if this were the case then there should be no
                        problem. We should be able to resolve our differences by agreed language so
                        long as we steer clear of the metaphysical and concentrate on the concrete.
                        The Secretary asked if <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> would
                        remain in New York after <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s
                        departure. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> confirmed
                        that this would be the case, the Secretary suggested that Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> continue their efforts to work out language which
                        would satisfy the concerns of both sides. He himself would wish to discuss
                        precise language with the President. The Secretary's view at the moment is
                        that the problem could be met by language which would commit us not to give
                        our nuclear weapons to anybody and not permit anyone else to use our nuclear
                        weapons without our permission.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that this was not the
                        whole problem. If, in fact, the United States does not intend to share
                        control with others he failed to see why this could not be reflected in
                        treaty language.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary felt that some way could be found to get around the problem.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> must realize, however,
                        that we cannot accept any language which would be tantamount to our saying
                        to our allies that nuclear defense arrangements are not their business.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> commented that at times he
                        has the feeling that our positions are similar. He would point out, however,
                        that the views of the United States on the problem are not always expressed
                        in the same terms and occasionally are even somewhat contradictory.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he felt we could make progress if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would cease to be preoccupied with
                        what seems to be philosophical problem. We did seem to be agreed on the
                        “gut” aspect of the non-proliferation problem and he felt that <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> should be able to work out acceptable language.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agreed that <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> should continue their efforts in New York.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said that he would be in
                        New York Tuesday afternoon and would contact the Soviet Mission at that
                        time.</p>
                    <p>In parting <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he wished
                        to thank the Secretary and through him the President for their warm and
                        gracious hospitality while <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0427"/>he was
                        in Washington. The Secretary said that he was glad <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> could fit the Washington trip into
                        his schedule since it was always pleasant and useful to talk with him. He
                        wished to reiterate the President's thought that our two countries have a
                        special responsibility for the peace of the world and that for our part we
                        are prepared to go more than half way in an effort to resolve the problems
                        which are of vital concern to both of us.</p>
                    <p>Since Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would face a battery
                        of reporters on his exit from the building, it was agreed that he would take
                        the following line in response to queries:</p>
                    <p>The discussion at dinner focused on disarmament matters including the
                        non-proliferation problem. Both sides agreed that this was a problem of
                        great urgency and that discussions should continue in an effort to reach
                        agreement.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary said that in his recent visit to New York<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">See <ref target="#d153fn1">footnote 1, Document
                            153</ref>.</note> he had had an opportunity for discussions with some 70
                        Foreign Ministers, including most of the Latin Americans. As <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was aware the Latin American <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0428"/>countries are very interested in
                        reaching agreement on establishing a nuclear free zone in Latin America.
                        There was some difference of opinion among the Latin American Foreign
                        Ministers as to whether they should proceed without Cuba. The Secretary felt
                        that anything Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> could do to
                        urge Cuba to participate would be helpful. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if all Latin American
                        countries were devoted to the nuclear free concept; he had the impression
                        that at least one country had some reservations about this. The Secretary
                        responded that perhaps one country was somewhat bemused with the idea of
                        developing a nuclear capability but he felt strongly that its reservations
                        with regard to a nuclear free zone could be overcome if Cuba were to
                        participate.</p>

                        raised with the Secretary the idea of exchanging views on peaceful uses

                        the Secretary's discussion on this matter with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> some time ago<note n="2" xml:id="d160fn2">
                            <ref target="#d123">Document 123</ref>.</note> and asked where we should
                        go from here. The Secretary said we would be prepared to set up a small
                        group of experts to focus on the problem and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> could discuss the matter further
                        with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the Soviets
                        were indeed interested in going forward with such an exchange of views and
                        the arrangement suggested by the Secretary would be entirely acceptable.

                        non-proliferation treaty. He said that he hoped to have British reactions to

                            the Russians would like the proposed treaty language. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> nevertheless thought it would be a good

                    <p>In discussing the principal points of Soviet interest in a non-proliferation
                        agreement, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> mentioned
                        the concern of the Russians <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0430"/>about
                        the possibility of a change in US attitudes. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that, when he referred to existing
                        US law on nuclear matters and to Congressional resistance to change in this
                        area, he was met with the argument that Congress might change the law in the
                        future. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> observed to the
                        Foreign Secretary that, under our constitutional system, one Congress cannot
                        bind another against changing the law; thus, the Russians must find their
                        protection in the withdrawal clause of the agreement. </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> also said that it seemed
                        clear on both sides that there should be no direct or indirect (through an
                        alliance) transfer of nuclear weapons to a non-nuclear state. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was troubled, however, by the idea
                        of transferring nuclear weapons to an alliance. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> seemed to be involved in a metaphysical question; he
                        seemed to think of an alliance as something separate from its members. </p>
                    <p>The Foreign Secretary stated that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did not seem to be concerned about <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consultation arrangements on nuclear
                        matters, whether old or new. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> observed that certain things were cleared away in the US
                        talks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would not raise questions on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consultations and was not interested in
                        what the arrangements would be in time of war or how the Allies might decide
                        to go to war. </p>

                            telephone call to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> in the early evening of October 16, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> mentioned that on the
                            previous day he and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                            had given him a paragraph on non-proliferation for the President's
                            approval. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            believed, however, that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had said that he was going to prepare a paper giving
                            the arguments for and against the paragraph. The President then read
                            this paragraph, which he had in front of him. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> twice told him that the key
                            sentence concerned the provision restricting the transfer of collective
                            ownership of the warhead. <p>When the President asked what the Germans
                                will think, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said
                                that they will grumble. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> continued that he and <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> favored the paragraph but
                                thought <persName corresp="#p_BRJ1">Robert Bowie</persName>,
                                Department of State Counselor, was opposed. As for the Soviets, it
                                was not the language <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                                had proposed, “but we think there's a reasonable chance they'll
                                either accept this or suggest a relatively minor modification of
                                it.” The President said he wanted a memorandum from Secretary

                                “not one chance in a hundred that the Soviets will buy it.” In reply
                                to the President's question about <persName corresp="#p_BRJ1">Bowie</persName>'s position, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_BRJ1">Bowie</persName> was for it too and had helped to draft it. “Well,

                        non-use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states. </p>
                    <p>

                        position regarding use of nuclear weapons which of particular timeliness in
                        view possible developments in NPT negotiations. </p>
                    <p>3. We believe that pressure to gain security assurances through proposals to

                            <ref target="#d122fn3">See footnote 3, Document 122</ref>.</note> has
                        been growing and is likely increase considerably as impression grows that
                        conclusion of <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> is becoming imminent.
                        Accordingly, we wish take this opportunity to state conditions, as
                        formulated by United States, under which United States would limit use of
                        nuclear weapons. Since operative para 3 of <gloss target="#t_NP1">NP</gloss>
                        res “invites the nuclear weapon powers to give an assurance,”<note n="4" xml:id="d163fn4">The sponsors of the draft resolution submitted a

                            things replaced paragraph 3 with a new paragraph 4, urging the
                            Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee to consider the proposal that the
                            nuclear-weapon powers give assurance that they would not use or threaten
                            to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states without nuclear
                            weapons on their territories. (U.N. Doc. A/C.1/L.368/Rev.1 and Add.1-6)
                        </note> we believe US Govt can properly respond with unilateral assurance
                        formulated in fashion acceptable to US Govt. Having made public statement,
                        we would then impress upon others as necessary that we do not intend agree
                        to assurances provision in <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. In explaining affirmative vote of the US, you should state that the US
                        fully understands the security concerns of non-nuclear weapon <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0435"/>states which undertake not to obtain their
                        own nuclear weapons. You should state that the US has previously recognized
                        this concern, quoting from President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s statement of October 18, 1964, that non-nuclear weapon
                        states “can be sure that, if they need our strong support against some
                        threat of nuclear blackmail, then they will have it.”<note n="5" xml:id="d163fn5">President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> made this statement in a radio and television
                            broadcast. For text see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the
                                Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon

                            </hi>, 1963-64, Book II, pp. 1377-1380. </note> You should then point
                        out that it is particularly appropriate for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, which was founded for purpose of maintaining international
                        peace and security, to consider question of security for non-nuclear states,
                        and to do so at time when there appears to be increasing opportunity to
                        conclude a non-proliferation treaty. You should express conviction of the US
                        that a non-proliferation treaty will advance the security of all states,
                        nuclear and non-nuclear. You should then state on behalf of the US Govt that
                        the US, taking into account all of these considerations and in view of the
                        invitation contained in operative para 3 of the resolution, declares its
                        intention to refrain from the threat or use of nuclear weapons against any
                        non-nuclear weapon state that is party to a general non-proliferation treaty
                        and that is not engaged in an act of aggression supported by a nuclear
                        weapon state. Finally, you should reaffirm US dedication to purposes and
                        principles of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter and state conviction
                        that both <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and policy just enunciated by
                        US will strengthen <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>5. In advance of making above statement, you should explain to US allies and
                        others, in your discretion, US thinking behind decision to make statement.
                        In addition to drawing on considerations in para 3, you should stress
                        following: </p>
                    <p>a. US Govt wishes create most favorable climate for maximum adherence to
                        possible non-proliferation treaty. </p>
                    <p>b. US Govt believes <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is proper forum for
                        consideration question security assurances for non-nuclear weapon states and
                        does not intend agree to incorporating assurances clause in text of
                        non-proliferation treaty. </p>
                    <p>c. Qualification that non-nuclear weapon state must not be engaged in act of
                        aggression supported by nuclear weapon state is essential for US. If
                        questioned about desirability of using words or concepts inherently vague,
                        i.e., “aggression” and “supported by nuclear weapon state,” you may explain
                        that the US would make its own determinations, should this ever be
                        necessary, and that this is situation which exists under present
                        circumstances. </p>
                    <p>d. No implications should be drawn re US policies in Vietnam. End Text. </p>
                    <p>Joint Chiefs “express their opposition to the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> proposal or any variation thereof. Their opposition
                        was based on the reason that such a non-use assurance could provide an
                        impetus toward total prohibition <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0436"/>of
                        nuclear weapons and that the total impact could alter the current military
                        balance to the detriment of the US.” They also said that a vote for the
                        resolution would “offset the deterrent effect of US nuclear power and free
                        the non-nuclear states for aggression without fear of nuclear reprisals.” </p>
                    <p>Secretary of Defense and <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> support
                        affirmative vote indicated in above instructions, as do I. </p>
                    <p>Believe <gloss target="#t_NP1">NP</gloss> resolution in question will be
                        adopted overwhelmingly. All other parts of resolution are free of problems
                        for US. Adoption of this resolution permits US to declare in its own terms
                        the conditions under which it willing to refrain from using nuclear weapons
                        against non-nuclear countries. Such a declaration should encourage accession
                        to <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. Moreover, of more immediate
                        importance, it would give US grounds for resisting proposals for other
                        disadvantageous limitations on use of nuclear weapons. Extent of limitation
                        on US nuclear deterrent resulting from terms of proposed resolution plus
                        declaration would not be significant: Restriction would not apply in the
                        event of any war in Europe in which Soviets gave their support; for
                        declaration to apply to North Korea and North Vietnam they would have to
                        become parties to <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and would have to keep
                        ChiComs and Soviets from giving them support in any hostilities; and perhaps
                        most important, question of whether an aggression has taken place and
                        whether a nuclear weapon state is providing support would be subject to US
                        determination.</p>
                    <p>I would propose to send the instructions if necessary at the appropriate time
                        if you do not indicate non-concurrence. It now appears, however, very
                        unlikely that vote will come this week. </p>

                    <p>When President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> approved
                        Latchkey II on November 3, 1966, the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> program consisted of
                        eight underground nuclear tests scheduled for the second quarter of fiscal
                        year 1967. (<ref target="#d134">See Document 134</ref>.) Cabriolet, the
                        first of a series of six nuclear cratering experiments under the Plowshare
                        program was not one of these eight; its authorization still awaited final
                        Presidential approval. The purpose of Cabriolet and other tests like it was
                        to obtain basic technical information about cratering and the subsequent
                        distribution of radioactivity that would be applicable to excavation of a
                        trans-Isthmian canal. It was not until <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0437"/>December 20 that <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Glenn
                        Seaborg</persName> received a telephone call from <persName corresp="#p_KSMJ1">Spurgeon Keeny</persName> that the President had
                        approved going ahead with Cabriolet. There was, however, one caveat, as
                        recounted by <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>: “there is to be
                        a prior announcement of what we propose to do (spelling out the nature of
                        the test, that it is peaceful in nature, that we see no problems with it,
                        that it has to be done within the Limited Test Ban Treaty, etc., … ).”
                        (Seaborg, <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, Volume 13, page 654.) </p>
                    <p>Cabriolet was scheduled to be set off on February 1, 1967, but was delayed
                        for technical reasons, and rescheduled for February 10. However, on February
                        9, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> abruptly changed
                        his mind and decided to cancel Cabriolet for the present. Concerns were
                        raised over Cabriolet's potential to hurt the ongoing negotiations on the
                        non-proliferation treaty and the Latin American nuclear free zone treaty, in
                        both of which peaceful nuclear explosions were an important issue. After
                        more discussions with Rostow in April regarding the rescheduling of
                        Cabriolet, <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> received a
                        telephone call on May 1 from Rostow informing him that he was to proceed
                        with “the planning of both Cabriolet and Buggy.” However, <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> continued, “There was no commitment
                        as to actually conducting the explosions—we were merely to plan—and there
                        was to be no public announcement.” (<persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>, Stemming the Tide, pages 333-334) </p>

                    <p>I believe there are two points which should be kept in mind relative to the
                        timing of the possible talks with the Soviets on Plowshare: </p>
                    <p>1. US/<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> talks on Plowshare with their
                        inevitable attendant publicity are likely to increase Indian reluctance to
                        sign a non-proliferation <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0438"/>treaty
                        which denied the non-nuclear countries the option to develop peaceful
                        nuclear explosives. The Indians have already raised strong objections to
                        this at the U.N., and their views have carried considerable weight with
                        other non-nuclear countries.<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">For an explanation
                            of the Government of India's position on peaceful nuclear explosions and
                            a nonproliferation treaty during this period of U.N. debate, see the
                            statement by the Indian Representative to the First Committee of the
                            U.N. General Assembly, October 31, printed in <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1966</hi>, pp. 676-686, and his statement
                            the following month, November 7, to the same organization; ibid., pp.
                            699-705. </note> Holding these talks coincident with the attempt at the
                            <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> to induce the non-nuclears to
                        accede to the non-proliferation treaty which had been agreed to by the
                        Soviets could present serious difficulties to the achievement of this
                        critical objective. </p>
                    <p>2. If Cabriolet is carried out during the period between the agreement to
                        conduct the Plowshare talks and their actual occurrence, and if venting
                        occurs which places radioactive material outside the borders of the U.S.,
                        the talks would provide the Soviets with a golden opportunity to belabor the
                        U.S. for violating the limited test ban treaty. Therefore, it would appear
                        desirable not to raise with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> the Plowshare talks until either a decision has been
                        reached to defer Cabriolet or until Cabriolet has been fired and the results
                        evaluated. </p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> we would be prepared to
                        have technical talks with a view to exchange of Plowshare information, as
                        well as discussions concerning the relationship of Plowshare to the Limited
                        Test Ban Treaty. I mentioned also the possibility of machinery through which
                        the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might provide Plowshare
                        services to other countries. On October 10, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> told me the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was willing to hold technical talks.<note n="4" xml:id="d166fn4">
                            <ref target="#d160">See Document 160</ref>.</note> He was not precise as
                        to their nature, and it was agreed that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> should work out the details. </p>
                    <p>There has been some delay in coming back to the Soviets because of the need
                        for inter-agency review, but we now plan to proceed in this way: </p>
                    <p>We would suggest that the talks be technical in nature, with the attached
                            agenda<note n="5" xml:id="d166fn5">The attachment, “Agenda for Plowshare
                            Talks,” is not printed. </note> being used, and that they be held in
                        Moscow as early as may be convenient, perhaps in mid-January. We would send
                        a small delegation of technical people, headed by <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> Commissioner Tape. The delegation would be instructed to
                        stay strictly within the bounds of the technical agenda, assuming the
                        Soviets accept this as a framework for talks. If such talks take place and
                        the Soviets make any formal or informal attempt to widen them, the
                        delegation would say that this is beyond their terms of reference, but that
                        they will be glad to refer this expression of Soviet interest in wider talks
                        to the U.S. Government. </p>
                    <p>As far as public information is concerned, we are thinking in terms of a
                        low-key announcement that US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> technical
                        talks on peaceful uses of nuclear energy are being held, but we would not
                        plan any communique or other public statement as to the nature or results of
                        the talks. Appropriate press guidance would be prepared prior to the talks,
                        since it may be difficult or impossible to avoid the fact becoming known
                        that the talks concern nuclear explosives. Press handling as well as other
                        aspects of the talks would of course have to be worked out with the Soviets. </p>
                    <p>I believe a limited probe and discussions of this nature might be very useful
                        in terms of giving us better knowledge than we now have of Soviet interest
                        and intentions regarding peaceful uses of nuclear explosives. Such knowledge
                        could help us deal on a more informed basis with such things as the
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> proposal for an
                        international Plowshare arrangement,<note n="6" xml:id="d166fn6">Not further

                        Committee of Principals and elsewhere, and forward planning of our own
                        Plowshare program. If <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0440"/>technical
                        talks take place they would be carefully handled with the object of avoiding
                        any harm to our non-proliferation and other disarmament activities. </p>
                    <p>I would like to move ahead along these lines in the near future, and unless
                        you think it inadvisable would plan to have Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> call in <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> before the end of November and
                        propose technical talks as indicated.<note n="7" xml:id="d166fn7">On

                            technical talks with the United States on peaceful uses of nuclear
                            explosives. <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> suggested at
                            this luncheon that such talks be held in Moscow, beginning January 16,
                            1967, where <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> Commissioner Tape would
                            head the U.S. Delegation of five or six technical experts. (Memorandum

                    </p>
                    <p>If the Soviet response is to suggest a broadened agenda, extending the talks
                        into political or disarmament areas, we will need to re-think our course,
                        and I will make a fresh recommendation to you. It is also possible they
                        might accept a limited agenda but attempt to broaden the talks in Moscow. In
                        that case, the delegation's instructions would call for referral back to the
                        U.S. Government, and I would anticipate the need to prepare for talks of a
                        different nature. </p>

                        subject of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> Systems.<note n="2" xml:id="d168fn2">When <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>
                            brought up the subject of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s at a
                            luncheon meeting on December 6, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> reminded him that the U.S. Government had never
                            responded to the Soviet Government's reply to <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> on March 17 that the question of
                            limitation of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems was worthy of
                            consideration because of the huge sums of money involved. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> also told <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> that the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> question should be considered together
                            with the problem of delivery systems of offensive nuclear missiles.
                            (Memorandum of Conversation; ibid.) In a supplementary memorandum of
                            this December 6 conversation, <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> added that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked why Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had made statements about the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> problem that might only stimulate
                            pressure upon him to deploy an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                            system. When Thompson responded that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, by mentioning evidence of a Soviet deployment
                            and by stating that it had already been taken into account in the
                            administration's plans, “had intended to build a kind of backfire
                            against just such a demand,” <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> remarked that he understood and had already come to
                            the conclusion that “this was a kind of anticipatory blow.” (Memorandum,
                            December 7; ibid.) </note> I said I had looked up the record and <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0442"/>had been surprised to find that I
                        had forgotten that following his conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> on March 17, the Secretary had told
                        him in my presence the following day that we would be glad to discuss this
                        matter quietly with the Soviet Union on a bilateral basis.<note n="3" xml:id="d168fn3">A memorandum of the Secretary's March 18 conversation

                    </p>
                    <p>The Ambassador pointed out that this was still not a reply to his remarks to
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I said that in any event, I was authorized to tell him that the President
                        would like nothing better than an agreement on this subject that would
                            hold.<note n="4" xml:id="d168fn4">In a telephone conversation with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> earlier that
                            day, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said
                            that <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> wanted
                            authorization to tell Dobrynin at their 4:30 p.m. meeting that afternoon
                            that the President endorsed talks with the Soviet Union on the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> issue. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> replied, “Yes … Let's go ahead.
                            That sounds good.” He added that he could not think of anything that
                            “would be more desirable” than “an agreement that would hold in that
                            field.” (Johnson Library, Records and Transcripts, Recording of
                            Telephone Conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, December 7, 1966, 2:16 p.m., Tape F6612.01,
                            Side A) </note> When the Ambassador pointed out that this statement when
                        translated into Russian would not be clear, I agreed he could say that the
                        President would like nothing better than an effective agreement on this
                        subject. </p>
                    <p>I continued that we recognized that an agreement would have to cover <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s as well as <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s. I said there were problems that would have to be discussed
                        such as what to do about submarines, if the agreement rested on unilateral
                        means of verification. I said the same might be true for mobile launchers. I
                        said I could tell him that we had already spent four billion dollars on
                        research and development of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> System
                        and could now proceed to manufacture and deploy, but said that this would
                        involve an enormous cost. He interjected that according to newspaper reports
                        this could amount to 30 or 40 billion dollars. I said that the cost would
                        depend upon how big a deployment was made but that it could run as high as
                        he had indicated. I said that if we both spend these enormous sums, we would
                        probably both end up still able to inflict terrible damage on the other and
                        we would be prepared to discuss what we could do to avoid this great cost
                        when we both had many other uses for our resources. </p>
                    <p>I said that we would be glad to have the Soviet Union's ideas on what
                        channels should be used for discussion of this subject and when. I pointed
                        out that there were several complications. One was that the Secretary would
                        not return until December 18<note n="5" xml:id="d168fn5">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> was abroad from December 4-18,
                            first visiting Japan, then Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, India, Iran, and
                            finally France, where he attended the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Meeting December 13-16. </note> and that he
                        was very much concerned and interested in this subject. I also pointed out
                        that the <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0443"/>Ambassador's return to
                        Washington was also uncertain. I pointed out that we had not taken up this
                        subject with our Allies and that because of the Ambassador's departure, we
                        had moved very fast on this matter and that I could not be very precise
                        about our thinking. </p>
                    <p>Speaking personally, it occurred to me that it would be possible to have a
                        formal agreement, but also that a tacit understanding might be possible in
                        which each of us would refrain from deployment unless we concluded that the
                        other side was going ahead. </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he would take this
                        matter up with <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> immediately upon his return.
                        Because of the meetings which would be taking place in Moscow, he could not
                        tell how soon we would have an answer. I pointed out that the urgency of the
                        problem arose from the need of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to present his budget to the Congress in
                            January.<note n="6" xml:id="d168fn6">For excerpts of <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s budget statement, January

                    <p>You have inquired as to what I think the Soviet reaction would be to an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment by the United States
                        under either Posture “A” or Posture “B” of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s memorandum.<note n="2" xml:id="d169fn2">Reference apparently is to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s December 2 draft memorandum to the President

                            heavy <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment by the United
                            States, Postures “A” and “B.” For responses by <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>, <ref target="#d170">see

                            Additional responses are scheduled for publication in volume X. </note>

                    <p>1. It is not presently clear how extensive the present Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment is. Whether or not they intend
                        presently a full scale deployment, I would assume that the initial reaction
                        of any announcement of a U.S. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system
                        would be to encourage and expedite a full scale Soviet deployment. </p>
                    <p>I base this conclusion on the history of Soviet emphasis on defensive systems
                        coupled with the fact that they have already commenced such a deployment. </p>
                    <p>I think the Soviet Union will also be forced to react by increasing its
                        offensive nuclear force to take into account our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment. While it would clearly be rational to do this
                        immediately—and there is no question about Soviet technical competence in
                        this regard—I am less certain as to how quickly they would react. Ideology
                        and history to the contrary notwithstanding, I think we should assume that
                        they will react in this way, although it may not be their first reaction.</p>
                    <p>The cost of a Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment and
                        improved and expanded <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capabilities
                        might be prohibitive in cost if pursued simultaneously. In this event, the
                        rational thing to do would be to cut back <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment and concentrate on an offensive nuclear force. But
                        the fact that they are defense-minded and that they have already commenced
                        an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> program might lead them to postpone
                        committing extensive resources to improve <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s.</p>
                    <p>I would agree with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s conclusions that a rational response by the Soviet
                        Union would not essentially change the existing situation; but I believe
                        there is a good possibility that this response (offensive missiles) might be
                        delayed for a period of time. If this is correct, deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system would give us a short term advantage
                        over the Soviet Union, and it might be two, three or four years before the
                        status quo was restored. That it would be restored, I have no substantial
                        doubt. </p>
                    <p>2. I think the Soviet Government should be approached directly with as candid
                        a statement of the existing situation as security permits—and I think this
                        could be quite candid. I think we should inform them of our intentions,
                        absent an agreement, which would as nearly as possible freeze existing
                        offensive and defensive systems. I think we should state our intention of
                        deploying some <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system if it is
                        impossible to reach a satisfactory understanding. </p>
                    <p>The Soviets have always linked the need for a freeze on both offensive and
                        defensive systems. I find this both significant and puzzling since it would
                        seem to me that a purely defensive freeze would be clearly to their
                        advantage. The only explanation of this that I can see is that they do tend
                        to think in defensive terms which, to a degree, would support the thesis
                        that they don't approach the problem as rationally as we do. </p>

                    <p>3. While you have not asked my views on Third Country problems it seems to me
                        that how these are handled is perhaps an equally important problem to be
                        faced. </p>

                    <p>The difficulty of predicting Soviet reactions is compounded by the fact that
                        in the period since the end of the war, their reaction to actions on our
                        part which were known to them were not what we would consider rational or
                        called for in the circumstances. Soviet assessment of a U.S. deployment of a
                        significant ABM system will vary considerably, pending upon whether we were
                        reacting to a major Soviet deployment or whether we had initiated this new
                        step in the arms race. I do not believe we can consider it as established
                        that the Soviets have at this time decided upon a major <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment. The Soviets have clearly
                        embarked upon a plan to increase the number of their ICBMs and to deploy
                        many of them in hardened sites. I believe they will carry this plan to
                        completion. </p>
                    <p>If we initiate major <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment, I feel
                        confident that the Soviet response in the first instance would be to do
                        likewise rather than to increase the number of their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s beyond already planned levels. I would
                        doubt that the Soviets could both deploy a major <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system and increase <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s
                        beyond planned levels without taking drastic action in some other field,
                        such as suspending their space program. </p>
                    <p>If it is clearly the Soviets that initiate <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment and we respond with a similar system, I would even
                        more doubt that they would increase their offensive weapons beyond planned
                        levels during the next five years or so because of the pressure upon their
                        resources of other important programs in the non-military field. I think it
                        quite likely, however, that as the significance of our planned improvement
                        in the quality <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0446"/>of our offensive
                        capability becomes increasingly clear to them, they may respond with a
                        similar program of qualitative improvement. I would expect that in any of
                        these situations, the Soviets would increase their submarine launched
                        missile capability. </p>
                    <p>Since the last war, whenever the Soviets have been faced with a choice
                        between the development of offensive or defensive capability, they have
                        generally opted for the defensive. This can partly be explained by their
                        belief in their own ideology, which postulates that Communism would
                        inevitably spread over the entire world and that the principal military
                        problem for the Communist countries is to protect themselves from the danger
                        that imperialism in its death throes might lash out against them in a
                        desperate military gamble. </p>
                    <p>Given the economic problems which the Soviets already face in the allocation
                        of their resources, which are insufficient to meet their goals, I believe
                        that their civilian leaders would welcome an opportunity to avoid incurring
                        the enormous expenditure which the deployment of a major <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system would entail, at least over the next
                        few years. On the other hand, the civilian leadership is weak in comparison
                        to past regimes and it seems probable that this has automatically increased
                        the relative influence of the Soviet military. </p>
                    <p>As the Soviet military acquire knowledge of the qualitative improvement in
                        our <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, they may well argue that an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system is essential to offset or at
                        least raise doubts in our minds as to the efficacy of our offensive
                        capability, since we could never be sure how effective their <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system was. On balance, however, I believe
                        we have a good chance of negotiating an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>,
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> freeze.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. The attached paper provided to me by the Board of National Estimates
                        states some views on likely Soviet reactions to an American decision to
                        begin deployment of an anti-missile system. I am in agreement with the
                        judgments made in this paper, and am therefore passing it along as my
                        response to the request made to each of us in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s office last Wednesday<note n="2" xml:id="d171fn2">December 7; <ref target="#d169fn2">see footnote
                                2, Document 169</ref>.</note> for a personal statement on the issue
                        posed. </p>
                    <p>2. Certain considerations which emerge from this study seem to me to be of
                        primary importance. </p>
                    <p>3. The first is that the difference in scale between the two alternative
                        United States deployment programs proposed would have little bearing on the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s reactions. The Soviets would,
                        even in the case of the more modest program, assume that, once embarked
                        upon, the effort would be enlarged. They would impute to us an intention to
                        reduce to a minimum the threat which their offensive systems pose to us, and
                        thereby to escape from the degree of deterrence which they now have. Either
                        program would convey to the Soviets that we were not content to remain in a
                        condition of mutual deterrence but were striving instead to gain a clear
                        power advantage. </p>
                    <p>4. A second major judgment then follows. Faced with this situation, the
                        primary Soviet concern would be to retain what we call an assured
                        destruction capability, that is, the power to impose vast and unacceptable
                        injury on this country regardless of the circumstances in which nuclear war
                        might begin. The Soviets would therefore deploy <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s of such types and numbers as to insure retention of such
                        a capability. In the end, after enormous costs to them and to us, the
                        condition of mutual deterrence would be likely to obtain as before. </p>
                    <p>5. Finally, the political implications for Soviet society and for
                        Soviet-American relations of such an intensification of the arms race seem
                        to me to be of significant importance. The strains imposed by such an effort
                        would at the very least retard what movement we have thought might be
                        developing toward moderation in the Soviet outlook and <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0448"/>toward liberalization in Soviet society.
                        Similarly, a new surge of competitive arming would tend inevitably to
                        sustain tension and mistrust between the two countries, and thereby to limit
                        even more the possibility of moving our relations gradually into more
                        constructive channels. </p>

                    <p>Soviet Reactions to a US Decision to Deploy <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> Defenses</p>
                    <p rend="center">I. General Considerations </p>
                    <p>1. The Soviet leadership would recognize in a US decision to deploy an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system a major move in the Soviet-American
                        power competition. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is very
                        sensitive to US economic and military superiority; it is acutely aware that
                        the US has a <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> more than twice that of the
                        Soviets and now has in numbers of deployed <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s roughly a 3 to 1 superiority. The Soviets have recently been
                        engaged in a very rapid buildup of hardened and dispersed <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s which we believe will give them, by
                        about 1968, much greater confidence in their retaliatory power and hence in
                        their deterrent. Since 1962, moreover, they have been constructing an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system to defend the Moscow area, though we
                        in <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> believe they have probably not yet
                        begun to install <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses
                            elsewhere.<note n="4" xml:id="d171fn4">There is, however, a differing
                            view within the intelligence community, which is that another system
                            (the Tallinn system) now being widely deployed in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is likely to be an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>; the implication of this view is that
                            the Soviets are already several years down the road of widespread <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment. [Footnote in the source
                            text.] </note>, <note n="5" xml:id="d171fn5">See <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-8-66, “Soviet Capabilities for Strategic Attack,”
                            dated 20 October 1966, and <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-3-66,

                            publication in volume X.] </note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. We believe that the fact of the US decision to deploy <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s would be far more important to the Soviets
                        than would the announced size of the US program.<note n="6" xml:id="d171fn6">We refer here to the Posture A and Posture B programs which have been
                            considered by the Secretary of Defense. Both programs contemplate <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment for defense of key US
                            cities; they differ in the level of defense to be provided. [Footnote in
                            the source text.] </note> The Soviets certainly have considered in their
                        military planning the possibility that the US would eventually build <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses. But an actual decision to deploy
                        an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system would probably have a further
                        influence on Soviet policy because it is a major new program with potential
                        impact on the strategic situation. The US <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0449"/>decision would tend to lend weight to interests in the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which press for larger military
                        programs. </p>
                    <p>3. The Soviets would almost certainly see the US decision as having been at
                        least accelerated by their own recent programs for missile defense and
                        strategic attack forces. In any event, they would view it as evidence that
                        the US was intent on maintaining and perhaps increasing its strategic
                        advantage over the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, even at the
                        expense of a continuation of the arms race. Some elements in the Soviet
                        leadership would see the move as a sign that the US considered nuclear war
                        somewhat more likely over the longer term. Associated US expenditures for a
                        shelter program would probably strengthen the voice of those Soviets
                        advocating this interpretation. </p>
                    <p rend="center">II. Possible Soviet Military Responses </p>
                    <p>4. It is important to remember that Moscow's view of the strategic situation
                        is the obverse of the view from Washington. While we worry about their
                        strengths and our vulnerabilities, they worry about our strengths and their
                        vulnerabilities. The Soviets have long been deterred from deliberately
                        attacking the US by the power of our forces to visit unacceptable damage on
                        their country in retaliation; they have also long feared that their own
                        strength might not be credible enough to deter the US in all circumstances.
                        Faced over the last two decades with the large, diversified, and
                        steadily-improving US strategic attack forces, a major feature of the Soviet
                        response has been straightforward defense measures, whereas our strategy has
                        concentrated mainly on assured destruction. In the past year or so, however,
                        the Soviets have begun the very rapid deployment of hardened and dispersed
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, the bulk of which are SS-11's,
                        useful mainly as citybusters. This intensive program to acquire an assured
                        destruction capability represents a new emphasis in their strategy. They
                        probably now see themselves as catching up with the US in this regard, and
                        expect shortly to gain a kind of deterrent equality with the US.</p>
                    <p>5. At minimum, therefore, the Soviets will be concerned to prevent any US
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment from robbing them of the
                        assured destruction capabilities they are acquiring. From their point of
                        view, either the Posture A or the Posture B program would threaten
                        eventually to degrade the deterrent power of their strategic attack forces.
                        This is because both programs are damage-limiting in nature—that is, they
                        are designed to protect the population and property in major cities, which
                        are the prime targets of retaliation—and because the smaller program, once
                        initiated, could well lead to the larger. The Soviets would consider it
                        essential to respond by improving their strategic attack forces to the
                        extent required to maintain their assured destruction capabilities. </p>
                    <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0450"/>
                    <p>6. This Soviet requirement would probably not result in any immediate or
                        dramatic changes in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s strategic
                        attack programs following a US announcement. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would have time to weigh the alternatives, because the
                        lead times required to deploy additional strategic attack systems like
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, or to develop and retrofit
                        advanced components like penetration aids, are not longer and in many cases
                        are shorter than <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> leadtimes. The Soviets
                        would have no difficulty in following the progress of our deployment and
                        could plan to reevaluate the numbers and types of weapons they require
                            accordingly.<note n="7" xml:id="d171fn7">There is even a possibility
                            that Soviet planning has already taken full account of the contingency
                            that the US would deploy <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s, and that
                            the Soviets would therefore not feel the need to alter their future
                            strategic attack programs at all. We think this unlikely, however,
                            because it has been unnecessary for the Soviets to authorize any
                            expensive new adjustments prior to an actual US decision. They must be
                            aware of the favorable lead-time relationship referred to above, and
                            they can be confident that major US decisions of this sort will be made
                            public. [Footnote in the source text.] </note>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Effect on Specific Soviet Strategic Programs </p>
                    <p>7. In discussing the following Soviet options and possible courses of
                        actions, we do not wish to imply that if the US does not decide to initiate
                        either the Posture A or B program at this time, the Soviets will not
                        undertake any of the programs discussed. In the strategic missile field, for
                        example, there is always great pressure to advance the available technology
                        through R&amp;D and to deploy new systems and modifications designed to
                        improve the effectiveness of the force. Specifically, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is quite likely to develop and deploy
                        more accurate large missiles with multiple warheads whether the US deploys
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s or not. In general, we will
                        probably never know the precise nature and extent of Soviet responses to a
                        US decision to deploy, though we are convinced that such a decision would
                        intensify Soviet arms programs in at least some ways. </p>
                    <p>8. There are a number of options the Soviets could exercise to preserve an
                        assumed destruction capability despite US <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment. Certainly such deployment would generate some
                        upward pressure on numbers of Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s
                        and sublaunched missiles, and it is one of the factors which might cause the
                        Soviet missile force to approach or exceed the high side of our <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> estimate for the period beyond 1968
                        (i.e., 1,100 launchers in mid-1971, leveling off to 1,200 in mid-1976).
                        Additional deployment of existing systems would have the advantage of using
                        tooled-up lines and proven techniques. Long-continued deployment of the SS-9
                        and SS-11 at the recent high rates would result in an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force of as many as 1,600 launchers in
                        mid-1971 and more than 3,000 in mid-1976, virtually all of them hardened and
                        dispersed. </p>
                    <p>9. On the other hand, the Soviets could respond with more sophisticated
                        measures. If they took the decision soon, we believe they could begin to
                        install very accurate multiple independent reentry vehicles <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0451"/>(<gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s )
                        in their large SS-9 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> or in a follow-on,
                        by about the time our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system could
                        become operational. Existing or follow-on systems could be equipped with
                        penetration aids by that time or sooner, depending on the type of such
                        devices the Soviets decide are most effective against our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has not flight-tested advanced reentry vehicles as yet, but we
                        believe such testing need not begin more than 2 or 3 years before initial
                        operational capability date in the case of <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>'s, and 1 or 2 years in the case of penetration aids. </p>
                    <p>10. A US decision might also cause the Soviets to intensify their development
                        of depressed-trajectory <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s or
                        fractional-orbit bombardment systems. Several firings from Tyuratam in the
                        past year have suggested feasibility testing of such systems, and we have
                        estimated that if development is pursued, initial operational capabilities
                        could be achieved by late 1967 or 1968. Such systems would probably be less
                        accurate than <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s. Used in small numbers
                        against key soft targets, they could evade US warning systems in a Soviet
                        first strike, but they could also be intended to complicate US problems of
                        developing effective <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses.</p>
                    <p>11. Finally, the Soviets have the option of placing greater stress on
                        aerodynamic vehicles as means of circumventing US <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses. They could intensify their current program of
                        constructing cruise-missile submarines (whose missiles can be used against
                        ship or land targets), perhaps by decreasing planned construction of the new
                        ballistic missile class we believe they have started to build. US deployment
                        of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s might even lead them to develop a
                        new manned bomber for intercontinental attack, though we doubt that they
                        would put much reliance on this approach to assured destruction capabilities
                        because of the vulnerability to attack of bombers on the ground. </p>
                    <p>12. Of the several options we have examined, the Soviets will choose
                        whichever combination they judge to be most cost-effective in the light of
                        the nature and pace of the US <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> program,
                        regardless of whether our initial decision calls for Posture A or B.
                        Retrofitting advanced reentry vehicles into existing systems might be the
                        cheapest approach for the Soviets, though reliance on such modifications to
                        assure penetration involves some risk. Additional deployment of existing
                        systems, on the other hand might prove a more visible increase in
                        retaliatory power and therefore might appeal to the Soviets. In any case, we
                        agree with the Secretary of Defense that the Soviets will act to maintain
                        the deterrent of an assured destruction capability, and that they have the
                        technical and economic power to do so. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Effect on Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        Program</p>
                    <p>13. The Soviets' own <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> program might also
                        be affected by a US <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> decision, but in
                        ways which are less readily definable. In general those Soviets who urge
                        bigger, faster <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> development and
                        deployment <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0452"/>would speak with louder
                        voices, if only because the US had adopted a similar program. A US decision
                        in the near future might have greater pertinence in this respect if, as we
                        in <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> believe likely, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is now deploying an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system only at Moscow and has not yet begun
                        to install such defenses at other locations. </p>
                    <p>14. In our recent estimates we have judged that, regardless of US <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> decisions, the Soviet predilection for
                        strategic defense and the massive threat they see in the US strategic attack
                        forces would probably cause the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                        extend <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses more widely during the
                        next 10 years. We have allowed, however, for the possibility that the
                        Soviets might decide that sufficient <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        deployment for the general defense of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was too costly. We think the costs for the Moscow system alone
                        will be the equivalent of at least $3 billion (excluding R&amp;D costs)
                        over the eight years apparently required to deploy it, from 1962 to about
                        1970. Soviet willingness to spend such a sum is consistent with the high
                        priority which has long been assigned to strategic defense and especially to
                        the defense of Moscow. There is no question that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could spend the equivalent of tens of
                        billions more on future deployment of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        defenses. But the Soviet economy is perennially stretched tight, and strains
                        which might arise from still larger strategic expenditures could come to
                        require the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to cut back on other
                        desired military and economic programs. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Smaller US <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        Program</p>
                    <p>15. The US could, of course, initiate an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        program of much more modest character than either the Posture A or B
                        programs. We think that the more general Soviet concerns we have described
                        would also be elicited by smaller programs, because the Soviets would expect
                        any US decision to lead eventually to larger-scale deployment. Certainly
                        they would not believe that any US deployment was intended solely to counter
                        the type of threat which might eventually be posed by China. But Soviet
                        military responses would be tempered by the lesser impact of smaller
                        programs on the Soviet strategic position. Indeed, there is at least some
                        chance that the Soviets would see a program to defend US <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> forces in a quite different light than
                        they would view the Posture A and B programs, recognizing that it
                        strengthened US assured destruction capabilities while posing no challenge
                        to their own such capabilities. Thus a US program to defend its <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s might cause the least adjustment in
                        Soviet strategic forces. </p>
                    <p rend="center">III. Some Political Implications </p>
                    <p>16. The foregoing discussion of measures the Soviets would probably take to
                        counter a major US <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> program forecasts
                        very considerable exertions by them to prevent the US from increasing its
                        margin of strategic advantage and reducing their capacity to deter. The net
                        result <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0453"/>would be to leave both sides
                        with a high degree of deterrence, much like that which now obtains, though
                        obviously in a much more complicated and costly weapons environment. While
                        the power equation would thus not be altered, some significant political
                        effects would flow from the process of raising it to a higher level. </p>
                    <p>17. The new round of competition in nuclear arms would have a negative effect
                        on the climate of Soviet-American relations. The arms race is not only a
                        consequence of the power competition, but a stimulus to it. The tensions
                        which arise from fear that the opponent is moving to acquire a decisive
                        advantage would be increased, and the still more complicated array of
                        weapons on both sides would enlarge the obstacles to arms control and
                        reduction. </p>
                    <p>18. This general result would not follow because the US decision to deploy
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s would give rise to a sudden alarm
                        on the Soviet side. The Soviets have known for a decade that we were working
                        on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s, they have claimed successful
                        development of such weapons themselves, and they would know that the US
                        decision to deploy could not alter the relation of forces suddenly. The
                        negative effect on the prospects for improvement in Soviet-American
                        relations would be the result rather of keeping alive on both sides the
                        sense of the inevitability of a continuing arms competition. Against this
                        background the likelihood of the kind of small but meaningful political
                        undertakings which could over time move Soviet-American relations in a
                        constructive direction would be greatly reduced. Moreover, the elements
                        within the Soviet leadership which reject the possibility of any fundamental
                        detente in Soviet-American relations would probably gain in weight and
                        influence. </p>
                    <p>19. The Soviet economy will in any event be under strains resulting from the
                        presently foreseeable military programs. A new round of costly competition
                        in arms expenditure would impose additional strains on the Soviet economy.
                        This would be unlikely to cause a breakdown, but it would mean that other
                        highly desired programs would have to be cut back or foregone. In
                        particular, hopes for any significant improvement in living standards would
                        have to be disappointed for some time longer. This would mean in turn an
                        increase in tensions in the society generally and probably sharpened
                        conflict within the leadership over the allocation of resources. While these
                        tendencies would not in our view go so far as to bring a reversion to
                        anything like “Stalinist” rule, at a minimum the prospects for further
                        advance toward internal liberalization would be retarded. In general, the
                        strains arising from intensified arms competition can, we believe, only have
                        an adverse effect on such internal forces as do work for constructive and
                        moderating change in the Soviet system. </p>

                        our initial proposal calling for <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> or
                        “equivalent international safeguards,” the Soviets also rejected our
                        suggestion to substitute “effective international safeguards” for their
                        language referring only to “safeguards of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>.” However, they acknowledged the need for an agreed transition
                        period (as yet undefined) before <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards could be phased into the Euratom area and said this period could
                        be fixed by a protocol or declaration of understanding. </p>
                    <p>The Soviets make the following arguments for their position: (a) just as we
                        have insisted on having US inspectors involved in inspection in the Soviet
                        Union in connection with a test ban treaty, the Soviet Union will not
                        entrust inspection of Germany to a group of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies in the case of a non-proliferation treaty; (b) if their
                        Eastern European allies are to be subject to inspection by the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>, there must be equality of treatment,
                        with allies of the US (particularly Germany) being subject to the same
                        international <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspection; (c) it is
                        unsound to endorse and perpetuate a regional approach to safeguards; and
                        they ask what our view would be if some of the Arab League countries formed
                        a Near East safeguards organization and who would judge if it was
                        “equivalent to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>” or “effective. </p>
                    <p>We see no reason to expect the Soviets to yield on this matter. They know
                        their position will be endorsed by an over-whelming majority of potential
                        signatories. Moreover, with no safeguards clause at all, the <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0455"/>Soviets would expect Euratom safeguards to
                        continue to apply to the FRG. We must, therefore, take at face value their
                        statement that if we cannot accept the kind of article they can support,
                        they would prefer no safeguards article at all. In this case they would be
                        strongly supported by such potential nuclear weapons states as India, Sweden
                        and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. These countries have indicated
                        their reluctance to accept the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards if some countries will have the privilege of being inspected
                        solely by their allies. </p>
                    <p>We, therefore, face a critical choice: Either we grasp this unique chance for
                        US-Soviet agreement on an article applying safeguards to all non-nuclear
                        countries, in circumstances where such joint support is essential to its
                        general acceptance, or we defer to anticipated concerns of certain Euratom
                        members and settle for a treaty lacking any meaningful safeguards provision,
                        thus abandoning one of our major arms control objectives. The
                        non-proliferation treaty provides our best (and probably our only
                        foreseeable) chance to achieve the stated US goal of a single, effective
                        system of nuclear safeguards applied worldwide. </p>
                    <p>Acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards under a
                        non-proliferation treaty would be a major step in establishing the validity
                        of our concept of appropriate verification of major arms control
                        undertakings. It would be accomplished through an institution established at
                        our initiative and operating according to our concepts of international
                        organization. </p>
                    <p>Other US interests would also be served. The active and joint participation
                        of Eastern and Western Europeans in the functioning of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards would foster practical
                        cooperation in dealing with the major East-West issue of nuclear controls in
                        Europe. Regarding the Near East, the inclusion of a binding safeguards
                        article would offer our best prospect for achieving the safeguards which
                        thus far the Arabs and Israelis have resisted. </p>
                    <p>A treaty lacking a meaningful safeguards provision would encounter strong
                        criticism in the Senate when it became known that our deference to Euratom
                        had prevented US-Soviet agreement on such a provision. While such criticism
                        probably would not be strong enough to affect seriously the treaty's
                        prospects for ratification, it would give rise to the argument that our
                        order of priorities is unsound in that we would have sacrificed an important
                        principle in arms control (verification) in order to protect an element of
                        Euratom's overall function which will become non-essential if <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards are generally applied. </p>
                    <p>In addition to enjoying strong Senate support, a binding safeguards article
                        would also have the firm support of the Department of Defense and the Atomic
                        Energy Commission. Letters expressing such support <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0456"/>are attached at Tab B, along with a similar
                        letter from the US Representative to the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d172fn3">Tab B consists of three

                    <p>Acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards in the Euratom
                        area need not impair Euratom's effectiveness or substantive functions. We
                        and others would continue to treat with Euratom as a corporate entity.
                        France, which can be expected to oppose <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards in the Euratom area, would in fact not be directly
                        affected since, as a nuclear-weapons state, it would not be subject to
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards. Moreover, there would
                        be no objection from the Soviets if Euratom wished to maintain its
                        safeguards while accepting those of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would suffer no discrimination. We
                        would, of course, consult with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in
                        working out means for dealing with anticipated attempts by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to enhance its status under the treaty. </p>
                    <p>Accordingly, I recommend the following course of action: </p>
                    <p>1. We should promptly inform our <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> allies
                        and the FRG initially, and then immediately other Euratom members, of the
                        results of our negotiations to date with the Soviets on this matter, making
                        clear we see no appreciable flexibility in the Soviet position. </p>
                    <p>2. We should tell them we attach major importance to inclusion of a
                        meaningful safeguards article and that, accordingly, we plan to explore with
                        the Soviets, still ad referendum pending further consultations with our
                        allies, the following possible arrangement: </p>
                    <p>a) Inclusion in the treaty of an Article III along the lines of that
                        appearing at Tab A, with the addition of the words “as soon as practicable”
                        at the end of the first sentence, and provided we achieve agreement on the
                        modalities and timing of a transitional arrangement which would be specified
                        in a public declaration; </p>
                    <p>b) the transitional arrangement would inter alia provide: </p>
                    <p>(i) that upon the entry into force of the non-proliferation treaty, Euratom
                        and <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> would exchange technical
                        information on their respective safeguards procedures with a view to
                        facilitating the application of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards in the Euratom countries; meanwhile <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards would apply to Euratom nuclear exports sent to
                        non-nuclear weapon countries outside the Euratom area; </p>
                    <p>(ii) that at such time as <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> will have
                        completed arrangements for applying its safeguards to the peaceful nuclear
                        activities of other advanced nuclear countries (informally agreed to
                        comprise India, Sweden, Israel, etc) it will also apply such safeguards in
                        the Euratom non-nuclear weapon countries (the modalities having been agreed
                        between the two organizations during the transition period); the public
                        declaration might have to include an agreed understanding regarding the time
                        period within which the application of safeguards to all non-nuclear states
                        is to be completed. </p>

                    <p>3. We should then seek to work out with the Soviets a concrete but ad
                        referendum proposal along the above lines, including in these discussions
                        our respective representatives to the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>A number of events have occurred during the last year which, taken together,
                        tend to bring to a head the long-standing issue of whether to produce and
                        deploy a U.S. anti-ballistic defense: </p>
                    <p>1. The Soviet Union has accelerated the deployment of hard <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s beyond the rates forecast in last year's
                            <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>

                            scheduled for publication in volume X. </note> (but not beyond the
                        “higher than expected” case on which the U.S. Defense Program was based). </p>
                    <p>2. The Soviet Union has started the deployment of an anti-ballistic missile
                        system around Moscow and a second type of system, which may have an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability, in other parts of the country. </p>
                    <p>3. The Chinese Communists have launched and demonstrated a nuclear-armed,
                        intermediate range ballistic missile,<note n="3" xml:id="d173fn3">On October
                            27, 1966, the People's Republic of China successfully launched a guided

                            by the Chinese Government, October 28, see American Foreign Policy:

                        that they may be preparing to test a booster in the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> range.</p>

                    <p>4. Our own anti-ballistic missile system, the Nike-X, has now reached a stage
                        of development where it may be feasible to start concurrent production and
                        deployment. </p>
                    <p>5. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reaffirmed their recommendation that a
                        decision be made now to deploy, with an initial operational capability in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972,<note n="4" xml:id="d173fn4">Reference is to <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>-742-66, December

                        Nike-X system which would provide for area defense of the continental U.S.

                    <p>6. The Congress for the first time since 1959 has appropriated funds to
                        prepare for the production and deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense system. </p>
                    <p>There are three somewhat overlapping but distinct purposes for which we might
                        want to deploy an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system:</p>
                    <p>1. To protect our cities (and their population and industry) against a Soviet
                        missile attack. </p>
                    <p>2. To protect our cities against a Chinese Communist missile attack in the
                        mid-1970s. </p>
                    <p>3. To help protect our land-based strategic offensive forces (i.e.,
                        Minuteman) against a Soviet missile attack. </p>
                    <p>After studying the subject exhaustively, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> and I have concluded we should not initiate <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment at this time for any of these
                        purposes. We believe that:</p>
                    <p>1. The Soviet Union would be forced to react to a U.S. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment by increasing its offensive
                        nuclear force with the result that: </p>
                    <p>a. The risk of a Soviet nuclear attack on the U.S. would not be further
                        decreased. </p>
                    <p>b. The damage to the U.S. from a Soviet nuclear attack, in the event
                        deterrence failed, would not be reduced in any meaningful sense. </p>
                    <p>The foundation of our security is the deterrence of a Soviet nuclear attack.
                        We believe such an attack can be prevented if it is understood by the
                        Soviets that we possess strategic nuclear forces so powerful as to be
                        capable of absorbing a Soviet first strike and surviving with sufficient
                        strength to impose unacceptable damage on them (e.g., destruction by blast
                        and radiation alone of approximately 20%-30% of their people and 50% of

                        available in the summer of 1970. 2. The production and deployment of the

                    <p>There is nothing I have seen in either our own or the Soviet Union's
                        technology which would lead me to believe we cannot do this. From the
                        beginning of the Nike-Zeus project in 1955 through the end of this current
                        fiscal year, we will have invested a total of about $4 billion on ballistic
                        missile defense research—including Nike-Zeus, Nike-X and Project Defender.
                        And, during the last five or six years, we have spent about $1.2 billion on
                        the development of penetration aids to help ensure that our missiles could
                        penetrate the enemy's defenses. As a result of these efforts, we have the
                        technology already in hand to counter any offensive or defensive force
                        changes the Soviet Union is likely to undertake in the foreseeable future. </p>
                    <p>We believe the Soviet Union has essentially the same requirement for a
                        deterrent or “Assured Destruction”<note n="6" xml:id="d173fn6">A term used
                            to describe one of two nuclear force capabilities. For a detailed
                            explanation by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, see an extract of his Military Posture Statement

                        </note> force as the U.S. Therefore, deployment by the U.S. of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense which would degrade the destruction
                        capability of the Soviet's offensive force to an unacceptable level would
                        lead to expansion of that force. This would leave us no better off than we
                        were before. </p>
                    <p>2. With respect to protection of the U.S. against a possible Chinese
                        Communist nuclear attack, the lead time required for China to develop a
                        significant <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force is greater than that
                        required for deployment of our defense—therefore the Chinese threat in
                        itself would not dictate the production of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system at this time. </p>
                    <p>3. Similarly, although the protection of our land-based strategic offensive
                        forces against the kind of heavy, sophisticated missile attack the Soviets
                        may be able to mount in the late 1970s might later prove to be worthwhile,
                        it is still premature to produce and deploy the Nike-X for that purpose.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary received Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> at 7:00 p.m. at the latter's request. </p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> read the following
                        oral statement: </p>
                    <p>“They have reviewed in Moscow the communication of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> in a meeting with the Soviet
                        Ambassador on December 6, 1966, with respect to an exchange of views between
                        Soviet and American representatives on the question of the possibilities of
                        reaching a mutual understanding between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. relating
                        to anti-missile defense systems. </p>
                    <p>“This question, raised in the meeting of December 6 of last year, deserves
                        attention. Indeed, the deployment of anti-missile defense systems involves
                        enormous expenditures, and it would be desirable to avoid them. The Soviet
                        Union has always come out for, and comes out for, the reduction of military
                        expenditures, for the limitation or cessation of the arms race. </p>
                    <p>“The Soviet Union constantly strives to reach an agreement on the liquidation
                        of the threat of a nuclear missile war. That would be responsive to the
                        interests of both of our two countries, and of all peoples. The question of
                        reaching a mutual understanding with respect to anti-missile systems could
                        be considered simultaneously with a solution of the problem of offensive
                        means of delivering nuclear weapons and in close association with the
                        problem of general and complete disarmament. If the Government of the U.S.A.
                        has any reflections in this respect, these reflections could be brought to
                        the attention of the Soviet Government.” </p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> left behind the

                    </p>
                    <p>In the ensuing discussion, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> clarified that it was his understanding of his
                        instructions that the Soviet Government was prepared in principle to enter
                        discussions on this subject on the understanding that the discussions would

                    <p>“I am authorized to confirm in principle our readiness to exchange opinions
                        on the technical level in connection with the peaceful uses of nuclear
                        explosives, as this was discussed by you at the time of the 21st Session of
                        the General Assembly of the United Nations. As regards the time of the
                        exchange of opinion, it would be possible to revert to this question a bit
                        later.” </p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> left the Russian
                        text of this oral statement. (Attached.)<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2">Not
                            printed. </note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In an ensuing discussion the Secretary stressed the urgency and importance of
                        this question in relation to consideration of a non-proliferation treaty. He
                        said that the subject had been raised by many non-nuclear countries during
                        our consultations. It was necessary that the Soviet <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0462"/>Union and the United States be in a
                        position to say that we were not foreclosing the possibility that
                        non-nuclear countries could have access to the benefits of nuclear
                        explosions. We should be in a position to offer to conduct nuclear
                        explosions for justified projects. </p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that this was
                        a political question; whereas, what was now contemplated were purely
                        technical talks and asked whether the Secretary was broadening his proposal.
                        He pointed out that the technical talks would involve a certain group of
                        experts, whereas, questions relating to non-proliferation were handled by
                        another group on a political level. </p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he would clarify the question. We had proposed technical
                        talks as a beginning, and these would be useful. Such technical talks would
                        lay the basis for coming to grips with the political aspects. The problem
                        had protruded itself and become related to the question of a
                        non-proliferation treaty. </p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he understood
                        this, but that he also understood that the Secretary was not proposing to
                        marry the technical and political aspects at this time. </p>
                    <p>The Secretary confirmed this understanding but stressed that the relationship
                        with non-proliferation made it urgent that we get ahead more quickly with
                        the technical talks than seemed to be contemplated by the Soviet side. He,
                        therefore, hoped that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> would ask his Government to put forward an early date
                        for the beginning of the technical talks. </p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> agreed to do so.

                            identified. </note> on the above subject, prepared in the Department of
                        State in consultation with the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. </p>
                    <p>2. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed
                        the draft position paper and interpose no objections to exploring with the
                        Soviets means of leveling off strategic offensive and defensive missile
                        forces. However, they reaffirm their recommendation that a decision be made
                        now to initiate deployment of Nike-X for an initial operational capability
                        in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972. They do not believe that Soviet
                        decisions as to future development of their offensive missile force are as
                        directly dependent on the US <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> decision as
                        is implied in the draft position paper. They believe that the Soviet
                        problems and uncertainties of coping with a US <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense would reduce the risk of a Soviet attack. Accordingly,
                        they believe that consideration of arms control agreements should not be
                        permitted to delay a decision for an initial deployment of a US <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. If the Soviets are interested in an
                        ABM deployment freeze, a prior announcement by the United States of a
                        decision to initiate deployment of Nike-X should provide pressure on them to
                        seek an agreement. </p>
                    <p>3. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Examination of various, previous
                        strategic nuclear delivery vehicle (<gloss target="#t_SNDV1">SNDV</gloss>)
                        freeze proposals has emphasized the many complexities in finding practical
                        solutions to the conditions necessary to make a freeze concept acceptable
                        from the standpoint of national security. The discussions presented in the
                        draft position paper indicate the complexities inherent in attempting to
                        negotiate with the Soviet Union in this area. The following are assumptions
                        and conclusions which are in the draft position paper and which are subject
                        to serious reservations by the Joint Chiefs of Staff: </p>
                    <p>a. The exclusion of current construction of the Tallinn<note n="4" xml:id="d176fn4">In the mid-1960s the Soviets began deploying a swath of
                            radars and interceptors across the U.S. <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> corridor. This system, code named Tallinn because it first
                            appeared near the Estonian capital city of this name, may or may not
                            have had ballistic missile defense capabilities. (Simon P. Worden, <hi rend="italic">SDI and the Alternatives</hi> (Washington, D.C.:
                            National Defense University Press, 1991), pp. 38-43) </note> System, a
                        most significant strategic deployment, from the freeze. </p>
                    <p>b. The dependence upon unilateral intelligence for verifying possible freeze
                        agreements, and the stated acceptability of arrangements that cannot be
                        effectively verified. </p>
                    <p>c. The assumption that full scale testing is required before deploying <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s and penetration aids. </p>
                    <p>d. The apparent assumption that a US ballistic missile defense deployment
                        would not provide a useful contribution to the total US strategic posture
                        with regard to both the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist
                        China. </p>
                    <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0464"/>
                    <p>4. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) In view of the lack of interest
                        expressed by the Soviets in this subject, it is believed that any US
                        Government approach to the problem should be to determine, first, whether or
                        not the Soviets are interested, in any way, in any form of an <gloss target="#t_SNDV1">SNDV</gloss> freeze and, if so, when and to what
                        extent, including or excluding <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s.</p>
                    <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) If the Soviet representatives show any
                        interest in this matter and indicate specific areas to be explored, the
                        provisions of a freeze proposal should be developed with full, deliberate
                        consideration, including review and analysis by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
                        prior to any commitment outside the US Government. </p>
                    <p>6. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff have
                        consistently held that any arms control agreement should provide for
                        adequate verification other than by complete reliance on unilateral
                        intelligence. Disagreement within the US intelligence community on the
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability of the Soviet Tallinn
                        System reinforces this position. Exploratory talks need not be blocked by
                        failure to agree on verification procedures. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should be informed early in the discussions that it will
                        be necessary to establish appropriate verification procedures in conjunction
                        with reaching a general area of understanding on forces to be frozen before
                        there can be a formal agreement. </p>
                    <p>7. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) Although the proposal would not preclude
                        research, development, and testing, there is a seeming inconsistence in the
                        discussion which indicates that under certain conditions the United States
                        should agree to refrain from making the qualitative improvements now planned
                        for strategic offensive forces (Poseidon, Minuteman III, and <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s) and that flight testing of <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s and other penetration aids should be
                        precluded. In contrast to this, it is proposed in the paper that, since
                        unilateral intelligence is incapable of detecting changes incorporated in
                        missiles to improve their performance, no limit be placed on changes in
                        missile characteristics as such. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that, in
                        order to avoid Soviet technological surprise and resulting degradation of US
                        military posture, research, development, and prototype testing must be
                        permitted under any freeze agreement and that US-planned improvements in its
                        missile characteristics must be pursued. </p>
                    <p>8. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) It should be noted that the US force
                        posture and development/deployment actions are extremely sensitive to the
                        possession of a <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> capability by the
                        Soviets. Therefore, the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> established
                        policy for its agencies on this subject is that all papers and discussions
                        will be classified Secret-NOFORN Except <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        and Canada. This policy was adopted to prevent acceleration of any potential
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> capability resulting from
                        failure to safeguard the concept and its strategic advantages. The Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff oppose initiating any discussion of <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. However,
                        they recognize that the Soviets may raise this subject and that US
                        participants in any such discussions must be prepared to respond. </p>
                    <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0465"/>
                    <p>9. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff agree with the
                        draft position paper that the United States should in no way indicate its
                        willingness to consider a trade-off of a freeze on manned bombers for a
                        freeze of <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s, with or without <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability. Any consideration of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> freeze must include <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s with a significant <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        capability. </p>
                    <p>10. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) With reference to discussion in the
                        draft position paper of the nature of the agreement to be sought, the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff agree that exploratory talks should be conducted informally
                        until a basis for an agreement is reached or it is evident that no agreement
                        is possible. However, should an agreement be reached between the United
                        States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> limiting strategic
                        arms, the Joint Chiefs of Staff would consider it essential that such
                        agreement be formalized as a treaty. </p>
                    <p>11. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) In summary, the Joint Chiefs of Staff: </p>
                    <p>a. Interpose no objections to exploring with the Soviets means of
                        leveling-off strategic offensive and defensive forces. However, this should
                        not be interpreted as affecting their previous recommendations to initiate
                        deployment of Nike-X for an operational capability in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972. </p>
                    <p>b. Believe that any US Government approach should be to determine first
                        whether or not the Soviets are interested in a limitation on strategic arms
                        and, if so, to what extent. </p>
                    <p>c. Consider that any specific arms control proposal, prior to committing it
                        outside the US Government, should be provided to the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        for review. Such proposals should be analyzed in the light of the then
                        current situation; for example, the required flexibility for handling the
                        Chinese threat. </p>
                    <p>d. Believe the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should be informed early
                        in the discussions that the United States intends to address the subject of
                        verification after a general area of agreement is determined. </p>
                    <p>e. Consider it essential that research, development, and prototype testing
                        must be permitted and US planned improvements in missile characteristics
                        must be pursued. </p>
                    <p>f. Oppose initiating any discussion of <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s
                        with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>g. Believe that any consideration of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        freeze must include <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s with a significant
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability.</p>
                    <p>h. Consider it essential that an agreement between the United States and the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> limiting strategic arms be
                        formalized as a treaty. </p>

                    <p>On January 20, 1967, <persName corresp="#p_MLC1">Leonard Meeker</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Joseph Sisco</persName> wrote a memorandum
                        to Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> informing
                        him of the preparations to sign the Outer Space Treaty. As summarized in the
                        memorandum, it was proposed by the United States to the United Kingdom and
                        the Soviet Union that the signing take place in three depository capitals:
                        Washington, London, and Moscow on January 27, and that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> host the Washington ceremony
                        scheduled for 5 p.m. at the White House. (Department of State, Central
                        Files, SP 4) The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union subsequently agreed to
                        the proposed signing date. After Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and U.S. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> signed the Treaty on behalf of the United States, the
                        British Ambassador, Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Patrick Dean</persName>,
                        and the Ambassador from the Soviet Union, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Anatoliy F. Dobrynin</persName>, signed it on behalf of their
                        respective countries. For remarks by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> at the signing ceremony, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1967</hi>, Book I,

                    <p>Signing ceremonies were also held in London and Moscow. Telegram 5985 from
                        London, January 27, reported that the Outer Space Treaty was signed at 10:50
                        a.m. by Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BG4">George Brown</persName>,
                        Soviet Ambassador Smirnovsky, and U.S. Charge Kaiser. Foreign Minister
                        Brown, the telegram related, “welcomed the Treaty as enlarging field of
                        international agreement and as significant step forward in building mutual
                        trust, understanding, and agreement in East-West relations.” Smirnovsky also
                        welcomed the Treaty as opening up an “era of cooperation in outer space.”

                    <p>On March 7, March 13, and April 12, the Committee on Foreign Relations held
                        hearings to consider granting its advice and consent to the Treaty. (Treaty

                        testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in executive session
                        on March 13, <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> telephoned
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> to report that “the

                        reflect my interpretation of what we negotiated.” He then indicated that he
                        was able to satisfy the lingering doubts of certain Senators on the
                        Committee. In concluding their conversation, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> lavished praise on <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: “I salute you and honor you for a

                    <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>I have asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> to return to
                        the Soviet Union as my Ambassador<note n="2" xml:id="d178fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Llewellyn Thompson</persName> was appointed
                            to his second ambassadorship to the Soviet Union on October 13, 1966,
                            and presented his credentials on January 23, 1967. </note> because of
                        the great importance I attach to the improvement of relations between our
                        two countries. I have full confidence in him, and I hope that you and your
                        colleagues will feel as free to discuss our mutual problems with him as you
                        would with me if we were able to sit down together. I am, of course, always
                        available to your Ambassador here through the channel we have established,
                        or directly whenever necessary.<note n="3" xml:id="d178fn3">The special
                            “channel” refers to a direct line of communication first established in
                            1963 between <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> and
                            President Kennedy through which views on pressing issues were exchanged.
                            Periodically during President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s administration, he revived this channel to
                            communicate directly with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. These communications were labeled “Pen Pal
                            Correspondence.” </note> I have arranged for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> to have a channel of communication
                        which will be open only to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and myself.</p>
                    <p>I have directed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> as
                        a matter of first priority to discuss with you and the appropriate members
                        of your Government the possibilities of reaching an understanding between us
                        which would curb the strategic arms race. I think you must realize that
                        following the deployment by you of an anti-ballistic missile system I face
                        great pressures from the Members of the Congress and from public opinion not
                        only to deploy defensive systems in this country, but also to increase
                        greatly our capabilities to penetrate any defensive systems which you might
                        establish. </p>
                    <p>If we should feel compelled to make such major increases in our strategic
                        weapons capabilities, I have no doubt that you would in turn <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0468"/>feel under compulsion to do likewise. We
                        would thus have incurred on both sides colossal costs without substantially
                        enhancing the security of our own people or contributing to the prospects
                        for a stable peace in the world. </p>
                    <p>I was accordingly glad to receive your message from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        <note n="4" xml:id="d178fn4">
                            <ref target="#d174">See Document 174</ref>.</note> indicating that the
                        Soviet Government is likewise concerned about this question. We have no
                        inflexible views as to how to proceed and would welcome yours. Perhaps after
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> has made an
                        initial exploration of this matter with your Government, it may prove
                        desirable to have some of our highest authorities meet in Geneva or another
                        mutually agreeable place to carry the matter forward. Similarly, we have no
                        inflexible views as to the nature of an understanding between us. Our
                        objective should be a mutually acceptable and stable balance of forces,
                        verifiable to the maximum extent possible by our national means. I trust you
                        will agree that this is a question not only of the greatest importance but
                        of considerable urgency. </p>
                    <p>May I express the hope that in the coming year peace will return to this
                        troubled world, and that we may find ways to cooperate in dealing with the
                        problems that face mankind today and for which our two countries, by their
                        very size and importance, carry a heavy responsibility. </p>

                    <p>123253. Eyes Only for the Ambassador. In your meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> you should make following oral
                        reply concerning talks on strategic <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0469"/>weapons question. You may leave an informal copy of your oral remarks. </p>
                    <p>“The United States has studied the oral statement of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on January 18, 1967,<note n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">
                            <ref target="#d174">See Document 174</ref>.</note> concerning an
                        exchange of views between Soviet and American representatives on the
                        possibilities of reaching a mutual understanding concerning anti-ballistic
                        missile systems. </p>
                    <p>“The United States Government accepts the Soviet Government's position that
                        discussions should include offensive strategic nuclear missile delivery
                        systems as well as anti-missile defense systems. This position is, of
                        course, without prejudice to whatever solutions may arise in the discussions
                        with respect to possible understandings on feasible combinations of weapons
                        systems which might be curtailed in order to curb the strategic arms race. </p>
                    <p>“Today both sides realize that a nuclear war would be disastrous for both and
                        that our strategic weapons can serve only to deter such a war. In this
                        light, it seems that the present strategic situation may be the most stable
                        we can hope to achieve in the near future. We each have large numbers of
                        well-protected weapons, and each has the ability with high confidence to
                        inflict terrible destruction upon the other, even after having received an
                        initial attack. Therefore, the initiation of such an attack is not now
                        rational. </p>
                    <p>“There are, however, disquieting signs that suggest that this situation may
                        become seriously altered in the near future. During the past several years,
                        the United States has consciously restricted its deployment of strategic
                        missiles and refrained from deploying ballistic missile defenses, hoping to
                        see a corresponding display of restraint on part of the Soviet Union.
                        Unfortunately, it now appears that there is an acceleration in the
                        deployment of Soviet systems. Although your deployments are no doubt
                        prompted by concern to protect your people, we believe we should both
                        consider whether this action, and whatever reactions on our part it will
                        necessarily cause, are in the interest of either of our countries. </p>
                    <p>“We believe that we understand your feelings on this point because they are
                        probably very similar to our own. The safety and security of our countries
                        must be the first concern of each of us. </p>
                    <p>“It is in this context that we believe we should discuss the implications of
                        the continued deployment of strategic missile and anti-missile defense
                        systems. It seems clear to us that if unchecked your deployments could raise
                        serious requirements for us with respect to our own deterrent. We will be
                        forced to increase our offensive forces and perhaps start to deploy an
                        anti-ballistic missile system. These actions on our part could <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0470"/>negate your new deployments and lead you to
                        decide on still further increases in your strategic forces. All of this
                        would be at great cost to both of us and might well lead to greater rather
                        than lesser risks due to the upward spiral in the arms race. </p>
                    <p>“It is also true that any evidence of progress in these talks would make
                        easier the accession by certain non-nuclear states to the non-proliferation
                        treaty which we both hope is nearing agreement between us. </p>
                    <p>“It is for these reasons that we believe we should discuss urgently whether
                        it is possible to curtail the arms race in strategic weapons systems. </p>
                    <p>“High level representatives should, we believe, discuss a prompt cessation of
                        deployment of additional strategic offensive missile launchers, and
                        anti-missile launchers and associated launch facilities. It will be
                        necessary to discuss respective strategic weapons systems of both sides in
                        order to reach agreement on precisely which systems would be involved. It
                        will also be necessary to be precise with respect to the undertakings
                        regarding cessation or curtailment of further expansion of deployment. </p>
                    <p>“The United States would be prepared to discuss the possibilities of placing
                        maximum reliance on unilateral means of verification to meet the major
                        objectives of ceasing further deployment of new missile and anti-missile
                        launch facilities without requiring inspection on either party's territory.
                        If discussions suggest that dependable curtailment of some aspects of
                        strategic offensive and defensive weapons systems would require on-site
                        inspection, such questions too could be included. </p>
                    <p>“We recognize that these and other complex questions will require careful
                        consideration by our representatives.</p>
                    <p>“The United States places no preconditions on these discussions. We do,
                        however, note that, especially since the discussions may extend for some
                        time, insofar as either side may make major changes in strategic offensive
                        or defensive weapons system deployment during the negotiations, such changes
                        might compel the other side to take the steps necessary to offset such
                        further changes. </p>
                    <p>“We suggest deferring consideration of the form in which an understanding
                        between us might be expressed until we see what such an understanding might
                        cover. And, after we have determined that such an arrangement is working to
                        our mutual satisfaction, we might achieve the climate for broader, as well
                        as more formal, agreements in the strategic arms area.” </p>

                    <p>The Secretary opened the meeting by welcoming Vice Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> and conveying the President's
                        greetings. He characterized the achievement of a Non-Proliferation Treaty as
                        a very serious task facing the world. He called it tragic that the Baruch
                        proposals of 1946 had not been accepted.<note n="2" xml:id="d180fn2">For
                            text of Baruch's proposal, June 14, 1946, which was delivered in the

                            on Disarmament, 1945-1959, Vol. I, pp. 7-16.</note> We therefore, he
                        said, now have five nuclear powers and that is five too many. He assured
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> that we don't yet have
                        agreement with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and, indeed, as far
                        as draft language was concerned the Germans have seen more of the proposed
                        American position than the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had. He
                        added that we will see the Russians again at Geneva at the conference on
                        February 21.<note n="3" xml:id="d180fn3">During 1967, the Eighteen-Nation

                        <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> was grateful for this early
                        opportunity to meet. He pointed out that, while some reports may differ from
                        what he was about to say, there were strong links between Germany and the
                        United States. He referred to the <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> policy statement<note n="4" xml:id="d180fn4">Given by

                            935-941.</note> and reiterated that Atlantic partnership was an
                        essential of German policy.</p>
                    <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0472"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> stressed that they had no
                        objection to the idea of an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. What
                        concerned Germany was to make peace safe. This did not mean less interest in
                        solving the German problem. Their principal objective remained the solution
                        of the German problem. Nevertheless, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        had problems with the treaty. He conceded that the US had [also] serious
                        problems, domestic as well as with its allies. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said he wanted to talk about those things which would
                        gain the support of the Bundestag for the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. He noted that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Embassy
                        had communicated the main German concerns. He said the Germans wanted strong
                        links with disarmament. They were concerned about nuclear blackmail. His
                        main point, he said, was that the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> should
                        not be used as an instrument of discrimination against the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in the peaceful development of atomic
                        energy. He mentioned in this connection a German firm which was on the verge
                        of a sale of a reactor to another country but subsequently was told by the
                        prospective customer that an American firm had raised the question of German
                        ability to guarantee an adequate supply of reactor fuel. By contrast, the
                        Americans could guarantee delivery. In <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>'s mind this example raised the specter of potential
                        unfair competition.</p>
                    <p>On controls, <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> stated his
                        understanding that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not
                        accept Euratom controls and wanted the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        system. He pointed out that if we get <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        controls over civilian fields, any advantages the Germans may have attained
                        would be exposed. He was concerned about industrial espionage. In addition,
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> wanted assurances that the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s concerns regarding disarmament
                        would remain in our minds, as well as problems which might develop with
                        other allies.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said the Germans, in common
                        with others, wanted a letter or some other document in hand setting forth
                        our interpretation of the meaning of the draft treaty language. This would
                        be needed for domestic reasons. If they had to wait until we explained the
                        treaty to the Senate that would be too late. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said he therefore wanted to ask again for a letter
                        giving our interpretations of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>On the European clause, <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said
                        that he and the Chancellor had agreed they could live with the American
                        interpretation. Not all of his colleagues, however, were in agreement. By a
                        united Europe he thought the United States meant a political organization
                        which has common control over defense and political policy. Perhaps it would
                        be best if we had some mechanism to cover the interim stage as well.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he would comment on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>'s observations. On problems of interpretation, the
                        Secretary saw no great difficulty. He noted that, unless there was a meeting
                        of the minds by the nuclear powers on essentials, there could be no treaty.
                        If there are real differences on interpretations, there is no agreement in
                        the long run. If significant disparities existed between the US and the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, we should know about <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0473"/>them—if the Soviets denied our public
                        position, then there would in effect be no agreement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> noted at this point that
                        almost all of the above points had already been made to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and therefore constituted no surprise. He
                        agreed to give the Germans a formal note which he hoped would cover their
                        concerns and which the Soviets could see.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said on the question of disarmament that all of us had
                        undertaken the obligation to work toward disarmament. He thought a
                        preambular statement on disarmament might be possible. He admitted that a
                        downward trend in the arms race was not yet in sight. He mentioned as an
                        example the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> problem, which <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> noted was a problem for Europe too.
                        The Secretary said <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> production on both
                        sides could lead to staggering multiplication of defense costs without a
                        parallel rise in security for either side.</p>
                    <p>On nuclear blackmail, the Secretary thought that this question should not
                        trouble our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies or Japan, but could
                        be a real problem to nonaligned states such as India. There was the question
                        of how we could risk 200 million American lives without receiving something
                        in exchange—commitment was really difficult without a treaty such as the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> agreement under which an attack on
                        one is an attack on all.</p>
                    <p>On peaceful uses, the Secretary said the treaty applied only to explosives
                        and he didn't see how nuclear explosives, since they are weapons, could be
                        excepted. Outside of explosions, there would appear to be no problem. He
                        wondered to what extent it was real to think of technological benefits
                        flowing from weaponry. He added that he had recently raised this question
                        with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> and that the only
                        positive answer he had received concerned some applications to metallurgy
                        involving perhaps $50,000 worth of business a year. The Secretary added that
                        he did not really see where the example Brandt had raised earlier involved
                        the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Euratom controls, the Secretary recognized, were a genuine problem. Looking
                        ahead to 1980, with plans by many countries for rapid use of nuclear power,
                        the Secretary thought there would soon be enough material to make several
                        nuclear weapons a day, adding that unless there was some control this was a
                        danger for everyone. He said we were trying to work out parallel
                        arrangements of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and Euratom,
                        recognizing that there would be a real problem if France objected.</p>
                    <p>In this connection the Secretary said he really did not know what French
                        views were, quoting one high French source as saying that if a nation has
                        the capability of making nuclear weapons it has the obligation to do so, but
                        others say that while France may not join an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> it would have no objection if others did.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out that happily no atomic weapon has been used in
                        twenty-two years, adding that if proliferation continued, however, <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0474"/>he was not sure this would always
                        be so. He wondered whether a general acceptance of Euratom and <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> controls might be helpful in providing a
                        solution.</p>
                    <p>On the question of a European option, the Secretary pointed out that it was
                        hard to talk about something that did not as yet exist and the shape of
                        which was not clear. What he could understand and what he thought we should
                        avoid would be to interpret participation in the treaty as an obstacle to an
                        integrated Europe. The Secretary thought that European political unification
                        could justify the invocation of the withdrawal clause of the treaty. He
                        mentioned again that the principal adherence problems should not properly
                        lie in an East-West context but rather with countries such as India. He
                        hoped that the problems raised would be manageable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said he would like to give
                        the Germans some suggestions on safeguards to allay their concern on
                        questions such as technological spin-off.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> asked whether a signed treaty
                        would be presented to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> or would it
                        be an open draft subject to amendment.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said there was no final view on this matter within the US
                        Government as we were trying to interpret the results of our talks with the
                        Soviets. He mentioned that we had not sought an “agreement” with the Soviets
                        on Article I and thought that at Geneva the US and Soviet co-chairman would
                        sit down to see where we both stood. He emphasized that we would not agree
                        to language not previously circulated to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said that the present plan
                        was to hold discussions in Paris with other allies in each case before
                        submitting new treaty language to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>He assured <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> on prior
                        consultations in the event of any changes in the text that had been
                        discussed.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary added that there were seventeen countries in Geneva, some of
                        which had not been consulted yet. He believed that more consultation would
                        be required as well as a period of private and public debate. He thought
                        that there would be some time “before this ship could be brought into
                        harbor.” He again pointed out that if there were different Soviet
                        interpretations on significant points there could be no agreement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> thanked the Secretary for his
                        comments, calling them very helpful. He wondered, however, since both the US
                        and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had voted on a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution to curb vertical as well as
                        horizontal proliferation why it was so difficult for both sides simply to
                        reaffirm this position.<note n="5" xml:id="d180fn5">Presumably a reference

                        was a problem for non-nuclear states. It gave nuclear powers an opportunity
                        to use methods to intervene on technological spin-off. He said that the
                        problem of explosions mentioned by the Secretary was not the main problem
                        and returned to the question of controls, specifically control of peaceful
                        uses. As an illustration he mentioned the Soviet note of January 28,<note n="6" xml:id="d180fn6">Not further identified.</note> calling into
                        question the peaceful purposes of the German nuclear program, and wondered
                        if propaganda blasts of this kind would not be multiplied.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary thought that the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> system
                        involved the acquiescence of the host country to the modalities. He asked
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> how <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> dealt with the question of industrial
                        secrets.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> confirmed that the country
                        composition of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspection team
                        must be agreed to by the host country. He added there was no limitation on
                        research for peaceful uses but that the controls were simply an effort to
                        account for fissionable materials, either those remaining in the producing
                        country or, if exported, subject to an end-use check to assure that they
                        remained in the country of destination for the purposes intended. He saw
                        little danger of a leak of industrial secrets, citing an American reactor in
                        Massachusetts that had been subjected to voluntary inspection four times. A
                        concurrent meeting of the Atomic Industrial Forum at that time concluded
                        that no danger existed of diversion of industrial secrets. He added that a
                        country can turn down an undesirable individual inspector if it so desires.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary returned to what he considered the kernel of the problem which
                        he said has been raised by a number of countries—whether the option of
                        becoming a nuclear power was ruled out by the treaty. He admitted this was
                        an important question for any country but it was the heart of the matter.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> wondered whether the treaty did
                        not bring about nuclear discrimination by dividing the world into three
                        groups, the nuclear states with two not signing, those who will sign, and a
                        group of about twenty states like Germany which are capable of producing
                        nuclear weapons and would be inhibited from doing so by the treaty.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that the third group would grow as fuels become
                        available. He noted that the possessor of a high school physics text and an
                        ordinary reactor would soon be able to make a nuclear explosion. It was much
                        simpler, however, if one did not have to start from the beginning.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>
                        wished to designate someone to discuss further the questions of industrial
                        secrets, controls, etc.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> thought that the experts might
                        have some of these answers.</p>

                    <p>138194. Eyes only for the Ambassador. 1. Of prime importance among subjects
                        you will take up with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> is, of
                        course, proposal for talks on strategic arms control. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> will presumably be familiar with
                        the President's letter<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2">See <ref target="#d178">Document 178</ref>.</note> and your oral remarks to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> (State 123253),<note n="3" xml:id="d181fn3">See <ref target="#d179">Document 179</ref>.</note> and
                        we hope will be prepared respond. You should stress strong highest level US
                        interest in subject; and desire to proceed with talks.</p>
                    <p>2. You may wish to repeat salient points your earlier statement. In
                        particular, at your discretion, we suggest stressing; (1) fact that US
                        prepared consider strategic offensive missile systems as well as defensive
                        anti-missile systems, (2) need as urgent first step to seek agreement to
                        head off escalation of arms race in such strategic-missile and anti-missile
                        systems, and (3) US readiness rely to fullest extent on unilateral
                        verification and belief that major step in freezing strategic systems
                        possible on that basis without on-site inspection.</p>
                    <p>3. As you will have noted in London's 6503 to Department,<note n="4" xml:id="d181fn4">Telegram 6503, February 15, describes talks held in

                        defensive strategic systems morally superior to offensive ones. If he makes
                        this point to you, you may wish note interaction and interrelation two sides
                        of same coin of strategic relation of forces, and that as indicated US
                        prepared discuss and reach agreement with respect to curbing both.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> may raise question of
                        reductions in strategic forces. You should say that possibility agreement on
                        reductions would certainly be enhanced by prior agreement not to make
                        additional deployments, but we believe necessary first learn to walk before
                        we can run. Also note that unilateral verification probably more difficult
                        for reductions, though without implying that any and all reductions would
                        necessarily require inspection. (You may also wish note one important
                        difference from 1964 strategic nuclear delivery freeze proposal<note n="5" xml:id="d181fn5">See <ref target="#d21">Document 21</ref>.</note> is
                        focus on launchers, rather than on production of missiles, which latter
                        would require on-site inspection for verification.) <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: Current consideration US position <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0477"/>focuses on launcher freeze, and not on
                        reductions, which we wish defer. Special <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>

                        substantial, though of course not unlimited, capabilities for unilateral
                        verification of measures along lines now being considered for strategic
                        launcher freeze. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>5. If <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> displays concern over
                        stated need to discuss “respective strategic systems of both sides” you
                        should stress that our only objective is have clear mutual understanding,
                        not probe into Soviet military secrets. We will be prepared to limit focus
                        our attention to matters directly relevant and necessary to reach agreement.
                        At same time, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> might bear in
                        mind that to extent important uncertainties exist with respect nature and
                        capabilities given system, elementary prudence will require defining
                        categories of weapons systems or resolving doubts in favor of more
                        formidable alternatives. May, therefore, be mutual advantages in clarifying
                        certain ambiguities. This of course question requiring expert discussion.</p>
                    <p>6. If <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> asks what US regards as
                        “offensive strategic nuclear missile delivery systems,” you may note that we
                        would expect discuss with Soviet representation but assume our general
                        approach would be missile systems of medium and intercontinental ranges,
                        land and sea based. With respect defensive anti-missile systems, would have
                        to include systems capable of countering strategic missiles, including
                        defensive systems having dual anti-aircraft and anti-missile capability.
                        Again, we assume this type of question would be discussed more concretely in
                        further discussions. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: Disarmament
                        Principals have not yet met in proposed talks. Deputies reached consensus on
                        including above indicated offensive and defensive systems: <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s and IRBMs, <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, SLBMs and SLCMs, and <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s
                        and “<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s which may have significant
                        anti-missile capability.” (We recognize difficulty in defining last named
                        category.) However, final decision on categories US would propose or be
                        prepared to include, on such questions as mobile land-based strategic
                        missiles, not yet taken. Current consensus not to bring in bombers. You
                        should not, therefore, go beyond general remarks this paragraph, and use
                        them only if <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> raises question
                        and if in your judgment such comments will be helpful in eliciting positive
                        Soviet reaction. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>7. No decision yet taken on question what to do about deployments underway at
                        present time or at time of possible agreement. We therefore wish avoid this
                        question at this time. If <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                        raises issue, you may note that we recognize question of facilities already
                        under construction as problem which would need be addressed in the

                    <p>1. I raised the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> question by recalling our
                        proposal for talks about <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s and delivery
                        vehicles, such as <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s,<note n="3" xml:id="d182fn3">See <ref target="#d181">Document 181</ref>.</note>
                        noting it had been made in hope that arrangements could be worked out to
                        stop armaments race in this most expensive area. Of course, if we had to
                        install an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system we would be capable of
                        doing so as well as <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could. We had
                        spent four billion dollars on research in anti-missile defense, about half
                        of it on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> research. While no one knew
                        exactly how much a full system would cost, there were estimates that up to
                        40-50 billion dollars would have to be spent on a system covering entire
                        country. Yet we believed that by time U.S. finished installing its system
                        and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> took steps it could take in this
                        area, both sides would be where they had started from in terms of their
                        security. While President subject to great deal of pressure from some
                        military men, manufacturers and Congressmen to go ahead with <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s, he resisting that pressure in hope that
                        two sides could find way of avoiding another step in arms race. Noting that
                        one of major difficulties in arms control discussions had been question of
                        inspection, I pointed out that we now prepared to rely, to extent possible,
                        on national means of verification. As to our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> research, it had been successful and we had developed a good
                        system, but we believed that installation by U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of such systems would be destabilizing
                        not only as far as these two countries concerned but also would raise
                        problems in world generally.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> responded by saying he
                        would not put problem in context in which I had placed it. Question was not
                        that of whose system better and whose worse. He could not agree to a
                        discussion of problem in this framework. If two sides wanted discuss this
                        problem, it was important to establish confidence. He did not have good
                        knowledge of U.S. system, and neither did I know well about Soviet system.
                        As far as he was concerned, perhaps U.S. system hundred times better than
                        Soviet one. He said he wanted to stress that he regarded President's
                        proposal from an entirely different standpoint, i.e., he believed that
                        President wanted to <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0479"/>have serious
                        discussions of how arms race and related expenditures could be curbed,
                        without any comparison of respective systems. Discussions could take place
                        in that framework but not in the other.</p>
                    <p>3. Referring to my comment on verification and our willingness rely, to
                        extent possible, on national means, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said this question of interest and could be subject of
                        discussion. However, he wished to stress once again that main problem in
                        this connection was confidence as no U.S.-Soviet agreement possible in
                        absence mutual confidence. Soviets desire such confidence; Soviets want
                        reliable arrangements under which parties would keep their word, and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> certainly would do so. If a U.S.-Soviet
                        arrangement, and particularly treaty, were achieved, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not want to see it torn up next
                        day, as tranquility would not be possible under such circumstances.</p>
                    <p>4. As to President's proposal, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                        said we already knew that <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would want
                        to discuss this problem. However, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        still considering all aspects of problem and this was reason for delay in
                        formal reply to President's message. He wanted me to report to President
                        that delay in response was due to Soviet desire give a constructive reply
                        and not to any underestimation of President's proposal. However, he could
                        say even now that discussion could not be only about defensive weapons. As
                        he had stated publicly in London, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        could not hold any discussions in framework of now it is cheaper to kill; as
                        Socialist country, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could not take such
                        stand. Thus, it important to discuss entire complex of problem. As everybody
                        knew, any weapons system could be overcome by another, and unfortunately
                        progress in this area could be made much faster than in area of agriculture
                        production and general increase of standard of living. This problem
                        unquestionably complex, but I should report to President that Soviets
                        seriously considering his message. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> reiterated that Soviets want to weigh all aspects of
                        problem and want their reply to be constructive.</p>
                    <p>5. Referring to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s assertion
                        that I had compared U.S. and Soviet systems, I said I had no intention of
                        doing so. Indeed, I did not know what Soviet system was. Only point I wanted
                        to make in mentioning our research was that we also capable of installing an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. Also, I did not mean to push
                        for a speedy reply; we knew that problem very complex one and we prepared
                        wait as long as necessary. Reason why we believed agreement in this area
                        possible and desirable was that it would not only promote trust between our
                        two countries but also enable them to spend their money on more constructive
                        things.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> observed he had not
                        understood me as pressing for an early reply, although he would not have
                        objected if I had done so. Point he had tried to make was that, in his view,
                        my remarks smelled of ultimatum. While he did not want to make this point a
                        point of contention in our discussion, he did not believe discussion should
                        be conducted in this vein. <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0480"/>As to
                        Soviet reply to President's message,<note n="4" xml:id="d182fn4">See <ref target="#d178">Document 178</ref>.</note> he would have liked to
                        reply sooner.</p>
                    <p>7. When I said again I had not sought to compare our respective systems,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> agreed but insisted tone
                        of my initial remarks had been such as to convey ultimatum. I denied any
                        intention of conveying ultimatum and reiterated that only reason why I had
                        mentioned research was to indicate that we proposing agreement not because
                        we incapable of installing an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system
                        ourselves; in fact, we could do it if need be. I said I was sorry if I had
                        perhaps expressed myself in way creating different impression.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said this of course
                        different question. Soviets wanted discuss problem as raised by President:
                        President had not compared our respective systems. He had simply suggested
                        that no system be installed. Soviets believed this was serious question
                        which should be considered. In any event, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said he thought that if he and I were to pursue this
                        discussion it could lead us very far.</p>
                    <p>9. I observed that if I had talked of who was ahead I would have had to say
                        that it was <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> because we had not yet
                        installed any <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s. I then repeated my
                        explanation of why I had mentioned our research in <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> field and reiterated my apology for conveying perhaps a
                        different impression.</p>
                    <p>10. I asked whether discussion should turn to another subject, such as
                        Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had no objection and
                        inquired if I was satisfied with his answer re <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s. He repeated I should report to President that delay in his
                        response to President's message due not to Soviets underestimating proposal
                        but rather to their desire seriously consider problem.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>There are three immediate problems facing the United States in
                        non-proliferation negotiations:</p>
                    <p>The first relates to the manner in which we make it clear that a
                        non-proliferation treaty will not prevent the creation of a federated
                        European state. The second relates to the development of an acceptable
                        article dealing with the safeguards problem. The third relates to a variety
                        of other problems, some dealing with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        security arrangements but more dealing with competitive problems in the
                        field of peaceful nuclear energy, some dealing with clarification of the
                        proposed treaty but more dealing with U.S. intentions.</p>
                    <p rend="center">I.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the first point, the objective which we wish to achieve is
                        Soviet silence, or non-contradiction, when our allies and later the United
                        States, state that the treaty would not bar succession by a new federated
                        European state to the nuclear status of one of its former components. We
                        cannot realistically expect the Soviets to say that they have agreed to the
                        creation of such a new federated European state since they would have
                        political objections to such a merger which transcend the problems of
                        non-proliferation but we can expect them not to assert that this treaty bars
                        it.</p>
                    <p>We have already agreed with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on the
                        broad outline of a plan to achieve this objective. We have given the Germans
                        a Draft Summary of the Interpretations dealing with the effect of the draft
                        treaty formulations on the problems of European unity.<note n="2" xml:id="d183fn2">On February 21, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> was instructed to give <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> a draft summary of
                            interpretations. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> received
                            these instructions in telegram 141946 to Bonn, February 21. This
                            telegram has not been found. The following day, February 22, <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> discussed these interpretations
                            with Charge von Lilienfeld in Washington.</note> The Note stated that
                        the draft treaty:</p>
                    <p>“… does not deal with the problem of European unity, and would not bar
                        succession by a new federated European state to the nuclear status of one of
                        its former components. A new federated European state <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0482"/>would have to control all of its external
                        security functions including defense and all foreign policy matters relating
                        to external security, but would not have to be so centralized as to assume
                        all governmental functions. It would bar, however, transfer (including
                        ownership) of nuclear weapons or control over them to a new multilateral or
                        other entity lacking the attributes of a federated state essential to bring
                        into play the legal doctrine of succession.”<note n="3" xml:id="d183fn3">This was the sixth and last paragraph of the Oral Note. The full text

                    </p>
                    <p>In this Oral Note we also told the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> that
                        we would give our interpretations to the Soviets as soon as possible after
                        we had agreed on the text of the provisions to be introduced into the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>. In the Oral Note we also stated that,
                        pursuant to your discussions with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> we were agreed that it would not be desirable to request
                        comments from the Soviet Union but that we would inform the Soviets that we
                        are providing them with a summary in order to inform them of explanations we
                        have given to our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies in response
                        to their questions.</p>
                    <p>This exchange with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> still leaves
                        unresolved the time at which we should make such a statement to the U.S.S.R.
                        and how such a statement should be made. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, as you know, believes that at this delicate period
                        of the negotiations we should hold off raising this matter with the Soviets,
                        unless they raise it with us and wait until a complete text is agreed upon
                        and raise the federation question only at the time we submit the full list
                        of interpretations to them. On the other hand, I am aware of your concern
                        that we should not go through the arduous task of further negotiations and
                        consultations with our allies on the treaty text if the Soviets are going to
                        publicly challenge an interpretation which the treaty supporters in Europe
                        will have to make public if they are to be able to support the treaty.</p>
                    <p>My own view on timing is largely influenced by the fact that, although
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> has not disagreed with
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s statement to him that
                        the treaty would not bar a federated Europe, his principal assistant,
                        Grinevsky, has raised this question twice with members of the U.S.
                        delegation and stated that the Soviets would have to object once the U.S.
                        stated its position on this matter. These statements, in my judgment, point
                        in the direction of a prompt statement of our position to the U.S.S.R. I do
                        not believe we should make this statement, however, until we have had an
                        adequate opportunity to satisfy ourselves that the statement we propose to
                        make will satisfy the concerns of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        allies—particularly the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. We should
                        therefore request information of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> on the point and, at the same time, ask him to point
                        out if the <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0483"/>discussions going on
                        between Bonn and the U.S.S.R. have produced any information which would
                        cause us to change our plan.</p>
                    <p>Once this has been done, I believe that in order to assure that the Soviets
                        understand the seriousness of this matter an approach to them should be made
                        simultaneously in Geneva and by you to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. The approach would not ask for Soviet concurrence with
                        our interpretation or with the desirability of a Federated Europe but would
                        seek their assurance that they will not challenge our interpretation. This
                        latter point would, I believe, alleviate most of the concerns expressed by
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> in Geneva's 2467.<note n="4" xml:id="d183fn4">

                            belief that the United States should not push the Soviets to agree or
                            disagree with the U.S. position on this issue. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> suggested that “If it should be
                            deemed necessary to challenge them [Soviets] on this issue, it would
                            seem to us far preferable to do so after they had committed themselves
                            to tabling agreed draft text.” (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SSI1">S/S-I</gloss> Files, <gloss target="#t_Exdis1">Exdis</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_Limdis1">Limdis</gloss>

                    <p>Regarding Article III, I propose we proceed along the lines which the
                        Delegation and <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss> have recommended for
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> discussions of that article in the
                        general discussion of a complete draft treaty text. We would plan,
                        therefore, to circulate to our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies
                        (and also to Japan) those parts of the text which they do not yet have. This
                        would involve the preamble (the receipt of which would be helpful in meeting
                        concerns about peaceful uses and desires to have the treaty set in the
                        context of a first step toward general disarmament), the text of the
                        definition of a nuclear weapons state (which we have already told our allies
                        we intend to insert in the treaty), and a revised Article III (which would
                        clarify the present language to meet some of the concerns that have been
                        expressed). We would plan to ask for early <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> discussion on the basis of this complete text with a view to
                        obtaining a “no objection” acceptance by the Council to our proceeding to
                        table the text with Article III with the Soviets as a joint recommendation
                        of the Co-Chairmen, with the understanding that further discussions and
                        consultation will continue as the text is discussed in Geneva.</p>
                    <p>As I indicated at your staff meeting, I think it would help overcome the
                        fears of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and others that safeguards
                        would hinder peaceful nuclear programs and involve risk of industrial
                        espionage, if we would indicate that we are considering an offer to invite
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> to apply safeguards on a broad
                        scale to U.S. peaceful nuclear facilities at such a time as <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards are applied to non-nuclear
                        weapons states under a treaty calling for mandatory safeguards on their
                        nuclear activities.</p>
                    <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0484"/>
                    <p>The offer would be made after determining that it would significantly
                        facilitate acceptance of our safeguards article by key non-nuclear weapons
                        states. We have already had positive indications that it would do so.</p>
                    <p>This matter is sufficiently important so that I recommend that we not
                        initiate this course of action without the approval of the President. I have
                        sent you, under separate cover, a memorandum to the President on this
                            subject.<note n="5" xml:id="d183fn5">A handwritten notation at the end
                            of this paragraph indicates that this memorandum from Fisher to the

                            On February 28 Fisher wrote a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> preparing him for his luncheon that afternoon with
                            the President. In this memorandum, <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> reminded <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                            that he had sent separately to the President a February 25 memorandum in
                            which he recommended that the U.S. Government put U.S. peaceful nuclear
                            facilities under IAEA safeguards. (Washington National Records Center,

                    <p>With respect to the other articles of the treaty we would anticipate that the
                        Oral Note which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>
                        gave <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> on February 22 will
                        meet most German requirements. There are various other German concerns and
                        requests which were contained in the presentation which Minister von
                        Lilienfeld made to me on February 22; some of these we can probably meet
                        although some of them, such as the request for a simultaneous U.S.-German
                        treaty assuring the Federal Republic of American supplies of fissionable
                        material, we cannot meet but they were probably not put forward seriously.
                        In any event, resolution of most of the additional points which the Germans
                        wish to discuss with us need not be obtained before tabling the draft treaty
                        but rather would have to be resolved before the Germans were faced with the
                        question of ratifying a final text. What we will need to nail down with the
                        Germans in order to obtain their “no objection” to our tabling a draft will
                        be the question of whether the interpretations of the treaty which we have
                        given them are satisfactory. We therefore will seek an early German response
                        to our Oral Note.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the question of whether the Italians can be persuaded to
                        acquiesce in the “no objection” formula will be dependent upon whether we
                        have the Germans on board at that time. The Italians are not likely to
                        object if, at the time of the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                        discussions, they are the only holdouts. In any event, a letter from you to

                        From Secretary. This is not an instruction but a sharing with you of my
                        increasingly grave concern about the possibility that we shall be in a false
                        position on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> in the absence of a
                        meeting of the minds with the Russians. I have in mind, of course, the
                        effect of an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> on European unity.<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2">See <ref target="#d180">Document
                        180</ref>.</note> I find it hard to see how we could pretend that there was
                        a treaty if the public interpretation given to it by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the US is directly contradictory on a
                        crucial point. If the Soviets were to permit our public statement of
                        interpretation to stand unchallenged, we would be in a strong position some
                        years hence if the point became operational. But if they challenge it openly
                        and publicly, then they are in position to employ maximum blackmail, threats
                        and pressure to oppose European unity. I realize that the Germans do not
                        require the Soviets to agree with our interpretation but I think we would
                        have a different problem if the Russians were publicly to oppose it. This
                        would give all those in Germany and Italy who might be looking for a pretext
                        a major point on which to oppose the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>This causes me to be very dubious about our joining with the Russians to
                        submit an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> to the conference with this
                        problem of interpretation unresolved.<note n="3" xml:id="d184fn3">See <ref target="#d180fn3">footnote 3, Document 180</ref>.</note> We would
                        look rather silly to join in submitting a treaty and have it become
                        immediately apparent that we and the Russians do not agree at all.</p>
                    <p>Please give me your best thinking on this point because I am not at all sure
                        we have yet reached the right answer. I will be wanting to discuss this
                        matter with the President very shortly and I want to have your full views.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>We have carefully studied your message transmitted by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">L. Thompson</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2">See <ref target="#d178">Document 178</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Your words about what great importance you attach to the improvement of
                        relations between our two countries cannot but meet with a favorable
                        response on our part. The confidential exchange of views through the
                        communication channels mentioned in your message<note n="3" xml:id="d185fn3">See <ref target="#d178fn3">footnote 3, Document 178</ref>.</note> is
                        undoubtedly useful both from the standpoint of a search for possible ways
                        for a solution to certain international questions and from the standpoint of
                        at least a better understanding of the positions of both sides on various
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>As to the question referred to in your message regarding the possibility of
                        reaching an understanding between us which would contain the strategic
                        armaments race, the Soviet Government has always advocated and still
                        advocates the curtailment of a race regarding any and all armaments. We are
                        deeply convinced that a real guarantee of peace and actual means of
                        strengthening national and international security can be provided only by
                        concrete steps in the field of disarmament, including nuclear, rather than
                        by a desire to solidify some “balance of power”—which in any case each side
                        understands in its own way.</p>
                    <p>Proceeding from this understanding of the problem, we are prepared to
                        continue the exchange of views on questions relating to strategic
                        rocket-nuclear weapons. As we understand it, you are in agreement with our
                        view that such questions must be considered as a complex, including both
                        offensive strategic nuclear delivery systems and systems of defense against
                        ballistic missiles.</p>
                    <p>Certain additional considerations of the Soviet side regarding an approach to
                        a solution of these questions are being transmitted through Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d185fn4">See <ref target="#d186">Document 186</ref>.</note> Nor
                        do we exclude the possibility of holding in the future, as you suggest, a
                        special meeting of our appropriate representatives for a more detailed
                        discussion of this entire problem.</p>
                    <p>Naturally, much more favorable conditions for businesslike consideration of
                        this as well as other problems of mutual interest would be <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0487"/>created if the situation in the world as a

                        Vietnam were liquidated. In this connection, one would like to think that
                        the hope expressed by you that peace will return to our planet will be
                        supported by appropriate practical action on your part.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>We note with satisfaction the agreement of the US Government with the opinion
                        of the Soviet side that the question concerning achievement of a mutual
                        understanding on anti-missile defense systems should be considered
                        simultaneously with the solution of the question of offensive nuclear
                        delivery means. Such a combined approach is in this case the only correct
                        one, since it would permit a real discussion of the broad objectives
                        concerning both containment of the arms race and disarmament.</p>
                    <p>However, as can be understood from your statement, the American side proceeds
                        from the premise that as a point of departure for consideration of these
                        problems it is necessary to recognize the present strategic situation as
                        “most stable” and to seek to preserve it for the future. Unfortunately, <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0488"/>in real life such “stability” by no
                        means precludes the risk of nuclear conflict. This is especially true in the
                        present situation which is characterized by the existence of dangerous
                        hotbeds of international tension. A buildup of the means of nuclear attack
                        which is being carried out in the US and the militant mood of certain US
                        allies which is finding support among influential American circles further
                        exacerbate the tenseness of the situation.</p>
                    <p>The presently existing strategic situation, which you call stable, has
                        another dangerous aspect. As a matter of fact, one can speak of the concept
                        of “stability” at any given moment only in very relative terms, as of a
                        combination and interaction of many factors which are understood differently
                        by the parties. Such “stability” creates in practice a situation where one
                        party in providing for its security is compelled, in response to the
                        accelerated production and accumulation of offensive strategic
                        rocket-nuclear means by the other party, to take steps for strengthening its
                        defense capabilities, while the other party in turn sees in this reason for
                        moving to a new and higher level in the armaments race spiral.</p>
                    <p>We believe it necessary to find a way out of this vicious circle. This in our
                        view can be done only if we seek equally to ensure the security of each side
                        rather than attempt to solidify such a correlation of forces as this or that
                        party regards at a given moment to be advantageous to it. Such an approach,
                        in our view, would meet the interests not only of our countries but also of
                        other nations, and it would meet the interests of the world at large.</p>
                    <p>It seems to us that the best way towards nuclear disarmament which would take
                        into account the considerations expressed above would be to destroy all
                        offensive weapons and, in any event, to reduce to a minimum the arsenals of
                        means for a rocket-nuclear attack, leaving—and then only temporarily—only
                        strictly limited amounts of such means. In such a case apparently no great
                        difficulties would arise for the solution of the anti-missile defense
                        problem either.</p>
                    <p>In our view, it is important first of all to reach some common understanding
                        with regard to the approach itself to the solution of this problem, after
                        which one could move to a discussion of more specific questions.</p>
                    <p>We would be prepared to consider any additional considerations which the
                        American side might wish to express on this matter. In this connection, we
                        do not exclude holding in the future, if it proves necessary, a special
                        meeting or meetings of our appropriate representatives for more detailed
                        discussions of this entire problem.</p>

                            noted that “at nine-thirty this morning <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> handed me <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s reply to President's letter on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s and made some oral remarks.” In this
                            same telegram, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> inquired about the possibility of a Department of
                            State or White House response to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s statement and he asked for press guidance. A copy
                            of the telegram is ibid.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. I interpret <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s letter and
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s statement as effort to
                        establish good negotiating position rather than intention avoid serious
                        discussion. Although not spelled out, implicit in <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s remarks is Soviet unwillingness
                        to freeze present strategic balance which we have publicly boasted is in our
                        favor. This, however, is difficult for Soviets to admit.</p>
                    <p>2. Possible approach to solution would be agreement by which Soviet would
                        maintain present <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment around
                        Moscow, agree not to complete or activate other <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> launchers, and Soviets would be allowed to complete or harden
                        agreed number of additional launchers which number would still be less than
                        ours in view of their Moscow <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment,
                        larger territory and greater dispersal their targets, large size some of
                        their warheads, etc. Both sides would be free to improve quality of their
                        missiles. Since Soviets doubtless have a number of missiles in their
                        production pipeline, our agreement for increase on their part would have
                        some practical appeal. The alternative of some decrease in our missiles
                        would make it easier for them to justify abstention from <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment and would have greater appeal to
                        world opinion. If we decide insist on deactivization Moscow complex they
                        will probably demand parity in number of launchers.</p>
                    <p>3. Best way to proceed to rapid agreement would be for us to present concrete
                        proposal but I realize this is difficult in view of uncertainty about their
                        present deployment <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s.</p>
                    <p>4. While would be useful to have expert assistance here, each step in
                        negotiation at this stage will have to be considered at top level here which
                        will be time consuming and I doubt if presence of expert yet justified.</p>

                    <p>5. I trust that any public statement on our part will be confined to
                        announcement receipt of reply to President's letter and fact that
                        discussions taking place in Moscow with no indication of position taken.</p>

                                suggestions should be considered to gain our Allies agreement on
                                Article III which could then be broached to the Soviets.
                                Specifically, Springsteen wrote, “We are prepared to take account of
                                two suggestions they [the Europeans] have advanced. One would

                    <p>Attached (at Tab <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss>) is a draft revision of
                        Article III which, in accordance with our discussions of a few days ago,
                        specifies the possibility of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        verification of Euratom safeguards. The draft article contains three other
                        changes which should be helpful to our Allies. In response to concerns
                        expressed to us, the new draft makes clear that there is the same
                        substantial transition period for all undertakings in the article. There is
                        no longer a provision requiring safeguards on the exports of non-nuclear
                        materials or equipment. And there is a statement that the purpose of the
                        article is to prevent diversion of materials to nuclear weapons manufacture.
                        These last two changes could be quite helpful to gain <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> assent since the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, as you know, has feared that the present article might be
                        a <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0491"/>basis for communist espionage or
                        for interference in peaceful industrial and scientific endeavors.</p>
                    <p>The key question is whether we put an article along these lines to the
                        Soviets before we discuss it with our allies. We feel strongly that we
                        should. However, there is difference of view on this question. I would,
                        therefore, recommend that you hold a meeting to discuss the issue, to which
                        you might want to invite Mr. Rostow, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> and
                        myself.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the case for proceeding with the Soviets first rests on the
                        fact that, while the chances of the Soviet's acceptance of the revised
                        Article may be great enough to justify proceeding with it, we will have
                        considerably greater difficulty in selling the revised Article III to them
                        than we will to our Allies. If we have developed the Article with our allies
                        first and are unable to negotiate it with the Soviets, we have started a
                        chain of events which may result in our inability to obtain any effective
                        safeguards Article at all.</p>
                    <p>We believe the Russians may fear that under the proposed article the US and

                        will fight strenuously for <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> acceptance
                        of Euratom safeguards with only a minimum of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> verification. They may thus want to avoid a situation in which
                        they might be forced to utilize obstructionist tactics in the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> to ensure what they believe would be
                        reliable <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> verification of Euratom. The
                        Soviets have also emphasized with us that safeguards must be exactly equal
                        for Soviet allies as for US allies. The Soviets may not wish to place
                        themselves in a situation in which, for whatever reason, they may feel
                        compelled to establish parallel regional safeguards in Eastern Europe. It is
                        of course clearly in our interest to avoid this also.</p>
                    <p>If our doubts about negotiability with the Soviets should prove correct and
                        if we should have proceeded with our allies first, we would then face a very
                        difficult and possibly unmanageable situation. We would have far less
                        prospect of a safeguards article for inclusion in the treaty, and we might
                        have lost a month or more of valuable time.</p>
                    <p>I also attach (at Tab <gloss target="#t_B1">B</gloss>) draft talking points
                        which we could use with the Russians when presenting this article for their
                        consideration on an urgent basis within the next day or two.</p>
                    <p>We would of course try to get an answer from the Russians as quickly as
                        possible. But even on the assumption that no answer came back before
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> held his talks in Bonn, he
                        could still have valuable safeguards discussions with the Germans. Among
                        other things he could:</p>
                    <p>1. Explain to the Germans some possible amendments which we think in any
                        event would be sellable to the Soviets, i.e., making clear that purpose of
                        the article is to prevent manufacture of nuclear weapons, deletion of
                        requirement for safeguards on exports of non-nuclear materials and
                        equipment, and specification that there is a substantial transition period
                        on all undertakings in the article;</p>
                    <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0492"/>
                    <p>2. Ask the Germans if it would be helpful for the US to undertake <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on a large segment of its
                        peaceful nuclear facilities (assuming, of course, that Presidential approval
                        for the offer is obtained);</p>
                    <p>3. Tell the Germans that we fully support the principle that non-nuclear
                        countries should be inspected by <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        inspectors of non-nuclear nationality (this is possible under existing
                        procedures of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>);</p>
                    <p>4. On verification of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> by Euratom, tell
                        the Germans that we are in fact pushing with the Soviets the concept of
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> verification of Euratom but we
                        cannot be certain whether this can result in a change in the safeguards
                        article;</p>
                    <p>5. Undertake with the Germans to give prompt study to any possibilities of
                        developing additional automatic means of inspection, e.g., “black boxes.” As
                        Director of <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> might state the willingness of

                        program with <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> funds.</p>

                    <p>For the purpose of providing assurance that nuclear materials used or
                        produced in peaceful nuclear facilities are not diverted to the manufacture
                        of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, the Parties agree
                        upon the following provisions. Each non-nuclear-weapon State Party to this
                        Treaty undertakes to accept, on all its peaceful nuclear activities, the
                        safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency or international
                        safeguards the operation of which that Agency accepts and verifies as
                        equally effective. Each State Party to this Treaty undertakes not to provide
                        source or fissionable material for peaceful purposes to any
                        non-nuclear-weapon State unless the material is subject to such safeguards.
                        The safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency shall be applied as
                        soon as practicable but no later than three years after the entry into force
                        of this Treaty, except with respect to activities or materials <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0493"/>to which other international safeguards are
                        being applied that meet the foregoing requirements of acceptance and
                        verification by the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

                    <p rend="center">TALKING POINTS</p>
                    <p rend="center">Revised Article III To Be Transmitted to Soviet Union</p>
                    <p>1. New article contains changes which we believe will greatly increase chance
                        its final acceptance by US's Western European allies. However, amendments do
                        not lessen fundamental effectiveness of article.</p>
                    <p>2. Article now requires <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards or
                        international safeguards the operation of which the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> accepts and verifies as equally effective. If the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> does accept and does verify as equally
                        effective any regional system of safeguards, we believe this will provide
                        reliable assurance to the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and its
                        members that effective safeguards are being applied. As practical matter,
                        Soviet Union should take into account that <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> countries subject to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards will not permit <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> to accept
                        any other safeguards as equally effective unless agreed verification
                        arrangements with the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> are in fact
                        reliable.</p>
                    <p>3. New article provides for transition period of three years from entry into
                        force of treaty. Soviet representatives have previously informed US that
                        transition period could be one, two, or three years.</p>
                    <p>4. New article states that purpose of article is to provide assurance that
                        nuclear materials are not diverted to manufacture of nuclear weapons. We do
                        not believe this changes any basic assumptions, but it will be helpful for
                        many of our allies who wish reassurance that safeguards will not be used as
                        basis for intervening in peaceful nuclear activities having no relationship
                        to manufacture of weapons.</p>
                    <p>5. The article no longer contains requirement that exports of non-nuclear
                        materials or equipment will be subject to safeguards. We believe this is not
                        a significant change since there remains clear requirement that all peaceful
                        nuclear activities of non-nuclear weapon parties will be subject to
                        safeguards.</p>
                    <p>6. US remains strongly committed to negotiating an effective safeguards
                        article in the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. We believe changes
                        described above should <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0494"/>meet all
                        concerns expressed to us in the past by the Soviet Union and could result in
                        widespread acceptance by the Western European countries, whose acceptance of
                        the article is essential.</p>
                    <p>7. We request the Soviet Union to provide us its acceptance or comments on
                        the new article as rapidly as possible since we are anxious to submit it to
                        our allies. If a favorable response can shortly be received from the Soviet
                        Union, we would be hopeful of including such an article in a co-chairman's
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> text to be submitted in the near
                        future at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>I have attached a safeguards article which I would recommend. It contains
                        three changes helpful to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The new
                        draft makes clear <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0495"/>that there is the
                        same substantial transition period for all undertakings in the article. The
                        provision relating to safeguards on the exports of non-nuclear materials or
                        equipment makes it clear that it is only the fissionable material produced
                        with these items, and not the items themselves, which are subject to
                        safeguards. And there is a statement that the purpose of the article is to
                        prevent diversion of materials to nuclear weapons development or
                        manufacture. These last two changes could be quite helpful to gain FRG
                        assent since the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has feared that the
                        present article might be a basis for communist espionage or for interference
                        in peaceful industrial endeavors. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KMB1">Kratzer</persName> also believes the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        can be satisfied that they will not have to accept Soviet inspectors from
                        the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> by getting the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to understand that this is the case under
                        the present <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> rules, provided this
                        interpretation is given them in writing and we assure them of our support in
                        case their rejection of Soviet inspectors is challenged in the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>I have discussed this matter with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> and he does not agree with the views expressed in this

                        undertakes not to provide to any such non-nuclear-weapon State:</p>
                    <p>(a) source material or special fissionable material unless the material shall
                        be subject to such safeguards; or</p>
                    <p>(b) equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing,
                        use or production of fissionable material unless the fissionable material
                        shall be subject to such safeguards.</p>
                    <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0496"/>
                    <p>(2) The safeguards required by this Article shall be applied as soon as
                        practicable but not later than three years after the entry into force of
                        this Treaty.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>We are now entering a new phase in our consultations with our allies on
                        non-proliferation. Bill Foster will be visiting key European capitals—Bonn,
                        Rome, The Hague, and Brussels—during the next two weeks to further clarify
                        questions that have been asked about the treaty draft, and hopefully to
                        convince key leaders that their legitimate concerns are or will be taken
                        care of.</p>
                    <p>We will also consult with the Japanese and Canadians here in
                        Washington—though their concerns are in some instances different than those
                        of our other allies.</p>
                    <p>As part of the consultation process we have already given key allies an Oral
                        Note which includes draft Summary of Interpretations of the present treaty
                            text,<note n="7" xml:id="d189fn7">See <ref target="#d183">Document
                            183</ref>.</note> which we would propose to show the Soviets after this
                        phase of allied consultation, but before a treaty text is actually tabled in
                        Geneva. We have also given our allies a fuller version of the treaty text.
                        This version is complete except for Article III, dealing with safeguards,
                        the text of which is still under consideration. This Article will be
                        considered as part of new consultations.</p>
                    <p>It is my hope that these new consultations would end in a meeting of the
                        North Atlantic Council, held as soon as possible after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s trip. At the Council meeting we
                        will seek a “no objections” agreement to the U.S. and Soviet Co-Chairmen
                        tabling a joint draft in Geneva which would be recommended by the two
                        governments for consideration by the Conference.</p>
                    <p>The problems which will be dealt with during these talks fall into three
                        general areas:</p>
                    <p>The first relates to the development of an acceptable Article dealing with
                        safeguards. The second relates to the manner in which we make it clear that
                        the non-proliferation treaty will not prevent the creation of a federated
                        European state. The third relates to a variety of other problems, <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0497"/>some dealing with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> security arrangements but more dealing
                        with problems of national competition in the field of peaceful nuclear
                        energy.</p>

                    <p>I am attaching as Tab <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss> a draft revision of
                        Article III which, in accordance with our discussions of a few days ago,
                        specifies the possibility of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        verification of Euratom safeguards.<note n="8" xml:id="d189fn8">Not
                        printed.</note> The revised draft contains changes which should be helpful
                        to our allies.</p>
                    <p>The key question with respect to the handling of this proposed revision
                        relates to the timing of the discussions of this revised Article III with
                        our allies. In view of the strong feelings of our Euratom allies on this
                        subject, I would propose that ideas in the revised Article III be discussed
                        by Bill Foster with our allies on his forthcoming trip. I would hope that
                        one of them can be persuaded to sponsor the text of a revised Article III as
                        its own; I have either the Federal Republic of Germany or Belgium
                        particularly in mind for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>It is not at all certain, however, that an Article of this kind will be
                        negotiable with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> because, among
                        other reasons, of the implied blessing they might feel that it gives
                        Euratom. I am particularly anxious to avoid a situation in which we lose a
                        month or so of valuable time, or having agreed with our allies with an
                        Article III which the Soviets reject, find ourselves under increasing
                        pressure from both allies and Soviets to drop the safeguards article. To
                        initiate Soviet consideration of this approach I am instructing Bill Foster
                        to indicate the concept, but not the details, of this particular solution to
                        his Soviet counterpart before he leaves Geneva. At the same time the allies
                        should be advised that if the revised Article III should prove
                        non-negotiable with the Soviets, it would not mean that we would lose
                        interest in the subject of safeguards, but we would be considering other
                        approaches, including those along the lines of the original Article III that
                        has been the subject of our recent consultation.</p>
                    <p>It would help overcome some allied fears that safeguards would hinder
                        peaceful nuclear programs and involve risk of industrial espionage, if we
                        would indicate at a propitious time that we are considering an offer to
                        invite <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> to apply safeguards on a broad
                        scale to U.S. peaceful nuclear facilities at such a time as <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards are applied to non-nuclear
                        weapons states. In concert with the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, I
                        have instituted a program of consultations with key Congressional leaders on
                        this point. The initial reaction has been favorable, but I will let you know
                        when we have carried this program somewhat further.</p>
                    <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0498"/>
                    <p rend="center">II.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the federated Europe problem, the objective which we can
                        realistically hope to achieve is Soviet silence, or non-contradiction, when
                        our allies and later the United States, assert that the treaty would not bar
                        succession by a new federated European state to the nuclear status of one of
                        its former components. We cannot realistically expect the Soviets to say
                        that they have agreed to the creation of such a new federated European state
                        since they would have political objections to such a merger which transcend
                        the problems of non-proliferation, but we can expect them not to assert that
                        this treaty bars a federated Europe with nuclear weapon capabilities.</p>
                    <p>The Oral Note which we have given key allies contains a number of our
                        interpretations dealing with the effect of the treaty. One of them, dealing
                        with the problem of European unity, states that the draft treaty:</p>
                    <p>“ … does not deal with the problem of European unity, and would not bar
                        succession by a new federated European state to the nuclear status of one of
                        its former components. A new federated European state would have to control
                        all of its external security functions including defense and all foreign
                        policy matters relating to external security, but would not have to be so
                        centralised as to assume all governmental functions. It would bar, however,
                        transfer (including ownership) of nuclear weapons or control over them to a
                        new multilateral or other entity lacking the attributes of a federated state
                        essential to bring into play the legal doctrine of succession.”</p>
                    <p>This is based on the principle that the treaty deals only with what is
                        prohibited. We will state that this is what we have told our allies, that
                        this is what we will be required to state in our Congress and if they
                        publicly contradict us, by stating that the Treaty prohibits a federated
                        Europe succeeding to nuclear assets of component states, such contradictions
                        would undoubtedly result in the collapse of the Treaty.</p>
                    <p rend="center">III.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the other articles of the treaty we would anticipate that the
                        Oral Note Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> gave
                            <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> on February 22 will
                        meet most German requirements. There are various other German concerns and
                        requests; some of these we can probably meet although some of them, such as
                        the request for a U.S.-German treaty assuring the Federal Republic of
                        continued American supplies of fissionable material, special nuclear
                        guarantees beyond our commitments involved in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and veto rights on the use of U.S. nuclear weapons deployed
                        on German territory, we cannot meet in the context of the negotiations on
                        the draft text to be tabled in the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>. We
                        can at this time tell the Germans that we are prepared to discuss the
                        question of assuring the continued supply of fissionable materials—though
                        not in treaty form. We <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0499"/>should also
                        tell them that we are prepared to work out veto arrangements similar to
                        those we have with some of our other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        allies. We do not believe we can or should give any encouragement to their
                        request for further security guarantees. A favorable response to the first
                        two requests may prove to be strong inducements for German support for the
                        Treaty.</p>
                    <p>In any event, resolution of most of the additional points the Germans wish to
                        discuss need not be obtained before tabling the draft treaty but rather
                        would have to be resolved before the Germans were faced with the question of
                        ratifying a final text. What we will need to nail down with the Germans in
                        order to obtain their “no objection” to our tabling a draft will be the
                        questions of the text of Article III and whether the interpretations of the
                        treaty which we have given them are satisfactory. We therefore will seek an
                        early German response on these points.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the question of whether the Italians can be persuaded to
                        acquiesce in the “no objection” formula will be in large part dependent upon
                        whether we have the Germans on board at that time. The Italians are less
                        likely to object if, at the time of the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                        discussions, they are the only holdouts. A letter from me to <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName> might be in order and perhaps one
                        from you to the Prime Minister.</p>

                        providing effective explanations of many of technical issues raised by our
                        proposed article. Unresolved are political issues raised by Article III
                        which are concentrated on Euratom and its members.</p>
                    <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0500"/>
                    <p>A variety of factors lie behind US objective to establish a worldwide system
                        of safeguards. Such a safeguards system will be more attractive to the
                        potential nuclear powers outside of Europe who will see in an exception
                        designed to take care of Euratom a special concession not granted to other
                        countries of the world. Soviets objection to acceptance of Euratom
                        safeguards on basis it involves allies inspecting allies has basis in
                        principle; they could not accept unless they were in a position to create a
                        Warsaw Pact mirror image of Euratom, something they might not now be able to
                        do and which would not be in our nor <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        interest for them to do.</p>
                    <p>U.S. nevertheless has accepted Euratom inspection as workable and effective
                        and recognizes that question may be raised as to why necessary to impose
                        additional inspection by <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and fear that
                        nuclear version of Gresham's law may develop and drive out Euratom
                        safeguards.</p>
                    <p>U.S. sees, however, as more important issue the political issue growing out
                        of feeling of discrimination resulting from inspection system contemplated
                        Article III among Euratom members. Whereas Euratom safeguards apply to
                        peaceful activities in all Euratom states, Article III safeguards would be
                        applicable to only five of six members. Since France will be excluded from
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards, some believe France
                        will then become choice location for all nuclear research and development
                        within Euratom community.</p>
                    <p>In addition, from foregoing flow questions of continued life for Euratom and
                        future of European unity if equality among Community members is impaired.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: While one may question rationale of
                        some of this argumentation, fact is that discrimination argument is one
                        France can play to her advantage and against us and our interests, and is
                        subtly doing so now.</p>
                    <p>Also clear from what Germans and Italians have told us Article III as
                        presently drafted and in present state understandings between us not
                        acceptable to them. We also know others in and out of Euratom have problems
                        of sufficient magnitude as to invite opposition to inclusion present

                    <p>Because <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> provides an unparalleled
                        opportunity to move forward on achieving an internationally accepted
                        safeguards system, we wish to obtain maximum support of our allies before
                        pushing forward.</p>
                    <p>In considering text of a safeguards Article U.S. prepared to redraft it to
                        take into account three suggestions allies have made. First would be to
                        establish overall substantial transition period of three years for entire
                        article. Second, to rewrite the provision relating to safeguards on the
                        exports of non-nuclear materials or equipment to make it clear that it is
                        only the fissionable material used or produced with these items, and not the
                        items themselves, which are subject to safeguards. Third, to insert a
                        statement that the purpose of the article is to prevent diversion of
                        materials to nuclear weapons development or manufacture.</p>
                    <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0501"/>
                    <p>You could point out that these last two changes should reduce their fears
                        that safeguards could be a basis for communist espionage or for interference
                        in peaceful industrial endeavors. In addition you could point out following
                        two points that we could make outside the agreement which should alleviate
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and others concerns. First, we can
                        assure them that they will not have to accept Soviet inspectors from the
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> by getting the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to understand that this is the case under
                        the present <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> rules, provided this
                        interpretation is given <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in writing and
                        we assure them of our support in case their rejection of Soviet inspectors
                        is challenged in the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. Second, we can
                        assure them that U.S. will continue to assure adequate fuel supplies for
                        their peaceful nuclear program, including reactors which they export. Latter
                        assurance will be dealt with more detail <gloss target="#t_septel1">septel</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: Congressional consultation placing
                        broad range of U.S. peaceful nuclear activities under <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards proceeding favorably but not
                        yet at point where Presidential decision appropriate. However, if your
                        discussions with allies take a turn where it appears that concern over
                        discrimination and potential industrial espionage is really based on fear of
                        competitive disadvantage with U.S. in reactor sales, you could ask if this
                        is the case and indicate we can take appropriate action to allay such
                        concerns. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>You should also indicate desire to Euratom countries to consider with them
                        following changes in safeguards article which might be discussed with
                        Soviets after this phase allied consultation completed. Indicate that we
                        have no draft to propose of such a revised article but prepared to consider
                        idea of Article III requiring <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards or international safeguards accepted by <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> under verification procedures mutually agreed with
                        Euratom. We wish to describe ideas which might be incorporated so that they
                        can be considered. This approach, like that of the Article we have been
                        discussing would provide for a transition period of three years and if the
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and the agency administering the
                        other international safeguards system (in this case Euratom) did not come to
                        an agreement during that time, then <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards would apply to the countries concerned. The U.S., however, feels
                        strongly about effective safeguards article in <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and would appreciate allied reaction to these ideas or any
                        other ideas allies have which would produce a similar result. In this
                        context allies should be aware that if the new element in the approach,
                        verification of regional systems by <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>,
                        should prove non-negotiable with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> we
                        would have to consider other approaches, including those along the lines of
                        a redrafted Article III that has been the subject of our recent
                            discussion.<note n="3" xml:id="d190fn3">See Attachment 1, <ref target="#d189">Document 189</ref>.</note>

                    <p>At 4 p.m. I attended a meeting of the Principals in Secretary of State
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s conference room. Present
                        were: <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName>,

                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> opened the meeting by calling
                        on Fisher. Fisher referred to the State/<gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> paper, “Proposal on Strategic Offensive and Defensive Missile
                            Systems,”<note n="2" xml:id="d191fn2">Not found.</note> that had been
                        circulated before the meeting, and said this is a simple plan that would not
                        go all the way that the Soviets want toward complete disarmament. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> went on to say that this plan has
                        been essentially agreed to by all the Deputies. He said its potential
                        success depends on the dependability of the unilateral detection system.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> mentioned that there are a
                        couple of places in the paper in which it is suggested that the U.S. make
                        concessions, even before the Soviets have said, no, and he thought we should
                        at least feel them out before establishing these less desirable positions as
                        the U.S. position.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then called on General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> for his reactions. <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> said that the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff have studied the paper and came to the following five or six
                        conclusions. They want a plan that would maintain the strategic superiority
                        of the U.S. at all times. They would insist on on-site inspection. If
                        on-site inspection was impossible, they would limit the plan to those
                        systems that could be verified unilaterally, and this would mean only the
                        fixed land-based systems. They do not wish to forego the possibility of the
                        U.S. deploying an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> in the future. They
                        believe that the plan should be formalized as a treaty. They think there
                        should be withdrawal provisions to come into effect if there were 1. hostile
                        actions interfering with our information-collection systems, 2. attempts to
                        deceive, or 3. deterioration of our ability to detect.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then called on <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> who said he does not think the
                        U.S. is ready to put forward such a plan in written form. He also said that
                        he thinks the U.S. should not agree to anything we couldn't check ourselves.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then asked me for my opinion.
                        I said I agree with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> found it a frustrating
                        situation because he felt we should do something along these lines, but we
                        shouldn't do anything that we couldn't check, and that doesn't leave very
                        much. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> called on <persName corresp="#p_WJE1">Webb</persName> who said that he could live with the
                        plan. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> called on <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> who said he is queasy <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0503"/>about our ability to carry out the
                        unilateral verification under the plan. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> called on <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> who
                        said he agrees with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, but
                        thinks some steps should be taken, and the question is how to begin.</p>
                    <p> Rostow said he is especially interested in the nature of the Soviet Tallinn
                            system,<note n="3" xml:id="d191fn3">See <ref target="#d176fn4">footnote
                                4, Document 176</ref>.</note> and thinks we should somehow learn
                        more about it. This led <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to
                        suggest that our first objective should be to try to establish the nature of
                        the Tallinn system. He thinks we might use this as a basis for opening a
                        dialogue with the Soviets, and perhaps we might be successful in a 6-12
                        month period of time. If we aren't successful, this particular plan is no
                        good; and if we are successful, we might be in a position to proceed
                        further. He said he thinks we should start with some exchanges on our
                        capabilities, and maybe even show each other reconnaissance photographs.
                        Rostow said, when we reach such a point, that might be the proper time to
                        table a paper.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> pointed out that we have been
                        talking a long time, and that we must talk in a context of holding down
                        offensive missiles. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> agreed
                        with <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> and expressed doubt that
                        the dialogue approach that had been suggested would be possible with the
                        Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> also indicated
                        that he doubts such discussions would be successful, but that there might be
                        a by-product, namely, we might end up in deciding on a mutually advantageous
                        unilateral showdown. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said
                        he doesn't think we are very close, that is, within a year or two, to an
                        agreement with the Soviets on any of these matters. (He left the meeting
                        about 4:45 p.m.) <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> made the
                        important point that he regards detection by national means as limited to
                        means within the power of the U.S. itself. He said he would have another go
                        at this with <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> in order to prepare a cable for
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>, to give him (<persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>) guidance to begin the dialogue
                        with the Soviets. These instructions would perhaps be along the lines of
                        probing further on three or four points.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> went on to say that verification
                        is a key issue, and that we are already having difficulty on verification.
                        He referred in this regard to the Space Treaty<note n="4" xml:id="d191fn4">See <ref target="#d167">Document 167</ref>.</note> and to “Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>'s treaty” (the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>). I said I bought the idea of this being my
                        treaty provided there were proper safeguards in Article III. Rostow
                        expressed optimism that the dialogue with the Soviets would be successful.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> expressed the interesting
                        thought that, as time goes on, we will find ourselves in the situation that
                        we won't be able to make progress in these matters in bits and pieces; that
                        we will need something dramatic to take a big step, and this within a few
                        years. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> ended the meeting by
                        saying he would circulate to the Principals the instructions that will be
                        sent to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>.</p>

                        Talks.</p>
                    <p>1. On basis Principals' discussion and your 3928,<note n="2" xml:id="d192fn2">Not found.</note> we have decided to proceed by your presenting paper
                        transmitted by this telegram, calling for talks to begin on April 12. For
                        such talks we contemplate sending small team of senior officials to assist
                        you.</p>
                    <p>2. Text of Oral Statement to be delivered to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, copy of which you may leave, follows (paras 3
                        through 8 below):</p>
                    <p>3. “The US Government has carefully studied Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s letter to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> of February 28<note n="3" xml:id="d192fn3">See <ref target="#d185">Document 185</ref>.</note> and
                        your statement<note n="4" xml:id="d192fn4">See <ref target="#d186">Document
                                186</ref>.</note> to me on that same date. Despite some differences
                        in approach, we see a common interest in ensuring the security of each side,
                        without jeopardy to the security of the other, by avoiding a further costly
                        and possibly dangerous spiral of the strategic arms race, and by creating
                        the basis for reductions in existing forces. Accordingly we believe it
                        possible and desirable to proceed promptly with discussions between our two
                        Governments.</p>
                    <p>4. “US Government shares the desire of the Soviet Government not merely to
                        prevent possible disruption of the strategic balance, but to move beyond
                        this to reductions of existing forces. We see the forthcoming discussions as
                        the best means to work together to increase the mutual understanding that is
                        necessary to make progress toward this common goal.</p>
                    <p>5. “While the US Government hopes that it will be possible to move rapidly
                        toward agreement on strategic arms reductions, it may be feasible in the
                        interim to find a way to 'level-off' strategic offensive and defensive
                        forces. We agree that measures for this purpose would have to be designed to
                        ensure the security of each side rather than attempting to solidify the
                        precise current correlation of forces or to freeze an advantage to one or
                        the other side. In other words, we recognize that some appropriate
                        adjustments in the present forces of each side might be necessary and would
                        still be consistent with our common objective of providing assurance <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0505"/>to both sides that their security
                        will be maintained or enhanced, while at the same time avoiding the possibly
                        disruptive effects and the great costs of continuation of a strategic arms
                        race. It will of course be necessary to discuss the respective strategic
                        weapons systems of both sides in order to reach agreement on precisely which
                        systems would be involved, and what undertakings with respect to them would
                        be agreed. The United States is prepared to consider the possibilities of
                        placing maximum reliance on unilateral means of verification of limitations
                        on deployment of strategic offensive and defensive weapons systems. With all
                        of these considerations in view, we suggest that measures of agreed
                        limitation on deployment should apply to all strategic offensive missile
                        systems (launchers) and to all defensive strategic missile systems
                        (launchers and radars) having a significant anti-ballistic missile
                        capability. We can see now how stationary systems can be part of such an
                        arrangement, but we will need to work out a way to include mobile systems.</p>
                    <p>6. “We continue to believe that it would be premature to consider the form in
                        which agreements or understandings between us might be expressed—treaty or
                        otherwise. The form would depend upon the content and nature of the
                        understanding.</p>
                    <p>7. “The United States Government believes that a thorough and frank
                        discussion of the general problem will in itself be of great value to both
                        sides. Increased understanding should not only assist us in reaching
                        agreements to limit and to reduce strategic forces, but can also assist in
                        dispelling uncertainties which lead each side to hedge against doubts by
                        acquiring larger forces than it might otherwise do. This in turn triggers
                        the other side to do the same, activating a spiral in the arms race.</p>
                    <p>8. “In view of the complexity of this general question, the US does not
                        believe that a formal agenda should be fixed. The US would welcome the
                        comments of the Soviet Government. The US Government is prepared to send
                        appropriate senior officials from Washington to support Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> in these discussions. It proposes
                        that the discussions begin in Moscow on April 12, and it hopes that the
                        Soviet Government will find it possible to agree to that date.”</p>
                    <p>9. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: It has been decided to open the
                        discussions without presentation at this time of a detailed US proposal.
                        (The draft position paper pouched to you has not been decided upon.) As a
                        result of our discussions, it has been concluded that our proposal in the
                        first instance should be limited to elements outlined in paragraph 5 above.
                        We hope it will be possible on this basis to engage in the dialogue
                        necessary before we can settle on a specific proposal. At the same time [we]
                        recognize the reserved and suspicious attitude taken by the Soviet
                        Government toward discussions of the strategic balance. We hope that the
                        positive reference to the long-term possibilities of agreements on
                        reductions, as well <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0506"/>as the broad
                        and loose framework for possible mid-term “leveling-off” agreements, will
                        provide a context in which it will be possible to introduce a more
                        sophisticated approach to the whole problem than the Soviet Government has
                        hitherto displayed. With respect to the short term, we hope that it will be
                        possible to establish a dialogue in which we can, for example, demonstrate
                        to the Soviets that it would be in their interest not to preserve secrecy
                        with respect to the mission and performance capabilities of the Tallinn
                        system which results only in the need for the US to assume the worst in
                        planning our own [future] programs. The dialogue may assist each side to
                        make better unilateral decisions, and to hold down the arms race, even if no
                        agreements are reached. (We recognize that care must be taken to avoid the
                        impression of an intelligence fishing expedition.) Increased understanding
                        of the current and prospective strategic situation could lead to unilateral
                        slowdowns in specific areas pending broader and perhaps more formal
                        bilateral agreements.</p>
                    <p>10. Our flexibility is designed not only to leave open the possibility for an
                        agreement under which the Soviets would be permitted, for example, to keep
                        their current Moscow <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> and their current
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deployments, which we are
                        virtually certain they will insist upon doing, but also to permit us to hold
                        open the option for a limited <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        deployment.</p>
                    <p>11. At your discretion, you may wish to indicate to the Soviets the level of
                        representation from Washington in your support in forthcoming talks. It will
                        be from State, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>—probably <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GRL2">Garthoff</persName>,

                    </list>
                    <p>In the course of our intensive consultations during the last few weeks, many
                        of the non-nuclear-weapon countries, including many of our important <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies, have expressed concern that the
                        proposed safeguards requirements in our draft non-proliferation treaty might
                        hinder their peaceful nuclear programs and leave them vulnerable to
                        industrial espionage. It might help to overcome these objections if the
                        United States were to invite the International Atomic Energy Agency to apply
                        its safeguards on a broad scale to U.S. peaceful nuclear facilities. The
                        justification for the exclusion of any U.S. facilities from the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards offer would be only on
                        military or security grounds and not for any commercial reasons. Such an
                        offer would be made to apply at such a time as mandatory safeguards as
                        specified in the non-proliferation treaty are applied to non-nuclear-weapon
                        states.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that you approve a statement to this effect to be made at such
                        time as would best help to achieve a satisfactory safeguards article in the
                        treaty. The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman
                        of the Atomic Energy Commission concur in this recommendation.</p>
                    <p>This concept has been discussed by the Atomic Energy Commission with
                        representatives of the major U.S. industrial and utility concerns involved
                        in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Many of these representatives think
                        it is quite a good thing to do in order to achieve an effective worldwide
                        safeguards system, although some of them point out that there will be
                        problems in implementation of the offer which will have to be worked out in
                        the course of negotiating the necessary arrangements with the International
                        Atomic Energy Agency. These arrangements will not only advance our national
                        interest in achieving safeguards, but will promote industrial interests by
                        establishing conditions which favor the widest possible export of nuclear
                        materials and equipment under safeguards.</p>
                    <p>It is our intention in making this offer to rely upon the voluntary
                        cooperation of the U.S. nuclear industry in implementing it, and our
                        consultations <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0508"/>have given us
                        confidence that this cooperation will be forthcoming. However, if it becomes
                        necessary in a few instances to rely on the Commission's regulatory powers
                        to require the participation in the inspection system by specific companies,
                        the Attorney General would have to determine whether the Commission's
                        current authority extends to requiring a licensee to open his facilities to
                        inspection by an organization other than the Commission or other U.S.
                        agencies. If not, some clarifying legislation might be necessary to ensure
                        enforcement in the unlikely event that the Commission's authority in this
                        field were challenged.</p>
                    <p>The British have indicated privately to us that if the United States were to
                        make such an offer, the United Kingdom would do likewise.</p>
                    <p>The proposed offer has been discussed with Senator <persName corresp="#p_PJO1">Pastore</persName> and Representative <persName corresp="#p_HC5">Holifield</persName> of the Joint Committee on Atomic
                        Energy, who concur. Senator <persName corresp="#p_GAE2">Gore</persName>,
                        Chairman of the Disarmament Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Foreign
                        Relations, indicated general agreement. Senator <persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName> expressed interest but did not commit himself;
                        in my judgment, he will support the idea because of his past support for
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards, because what we are
                        planning appears reasonable under the circumstances, and because it would
                        not adversely affect industrial uses of atomic energy. Senators <hi rend="italic">Mansfield</hi> and <persName corresp="#p_DEMK1">Dirksen</persName> were both noncommittal, but I think they will rely on
                        the views of Senators <persName corresp="#p_PJO1">Pastore</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName>, respectively.</p>

                            non-nuclear-weapon countries have expressed concern over the

                            Non-Proliferation Treaty and fear that this would leave them vulnerable
                            to industrial espionage. One method which has been suggested for
                            overcoming these objections would be for the U.S. to offer to apply
                                <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on a broad scale to

                        nuclear facilities in connection with the negotiations on the

                    <p>The draft safeguards article in the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> would
                        apply <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards only to the peaceful
                        facilities of non-nuclear-weapons states since it is clear that the Soviets
                        will not accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspection on their
                        facilities at this time. This is considered discriminatory by some
                        non-nuclear-weapons states and has also led to the charge that it might
                        permit industrial espionage to the advantage of the existing nuclear-weapons
                        states. This voluntary action on our part would help to answer these
                        objections to the treaty.</p>
                    <p>It is proposed to rely on voluntary cooperation of U.S. industry to implement
                        this offer. However, if it became necessary, the government would determine

                        called me to say that during a conversation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d195fn2">Not
                            further identified.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had suggested it might be
                        useful if he and I had a conversation. I mentioned Mac's suggestion to the
                        President and to <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName>, both of whom
                        urged me to arrange to see <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                    <p>On April 5, I called <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and
                        reported to him Mac's conversation with me. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> hedged a bit as to whether he or Mac had suggested
                        we meet. In any case, he accepted my invitation for lunch on April 11. I
                        gave him the choice of lunching at the Pentagon or at my home. He chose the
                        latter. We met there for approximately two hours today. Among the subjects
                        we discussed were the following:</p>
                    <p>1. Non-Proliferation Treaty. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        asked my view of the prospects for the Treaty. I stated I was uncertain of
                        the attitudes of India and <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0511"/>certain
                        of the non-European powers, but believed that after possible clarification
                        of a few points, western European nations, excluding France, would support
                        the Treaty. He asked whether I believed the Federal Republic was really
                        concerned about the U.S. and Soviet Union making a “deal” which would
                        advance their interests at the expense of Germany. I replied that although
                        we had no intention of doing so, many Germans feared we would—this was a
                        factor which both we and the Soviets must take into account in connection
                        with the proposed Treaty.</p>
                    <p>2. The Communique of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Nuclear
                        Planning Group.<note n="3" xml:id="d195fn3">On December 14, 1966, Ministers
                            of the Defence Planning Committee approved recommendations of the
                            Special Committee of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Defense
                            Ministers which had been formed in 1965. The recommendations called for
                            the establishment of two permanent bodies for nuclear planning: the
                            Nuclear Defence Affairs Committee, open to all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries; and a smaller Nuclear Planning Group
                                (<gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss>) of seven countries. The <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss>'s first meeting was held April 6-7,
                            1967, in Washington. For text of the communique, April 7, see American
                            Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1967, pp. 285-286. See also Foreign

                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> referred to a sentence in
                        the communique which stated that <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> “led a discussion on the role of host countries in
                        allied arrangements for the planning and use of nuclear weapons.” He asked
                        whether we planned to dilute the authority of the President in the control
                        of nuclear weapons. I replied we had no intention of doing so; under the law
                        we had no authority to do so; we had no plan for asking for a change in the
                        law; and if we were to ask for a change in the law for this purpose, the
                        Congress would probably not accede to our request. I added that no member of
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had asked that we give up
                        Presidential authority over the use or release of the weapons. The German
                        interest in the role of host countries was associated with their desire for
                        discussion of a possible veto [by?] host countries of the use of such
                        weapons. I stated that heretofore such subject had not been discussed among
                        the nations of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>—this was one of the
                        reasons why the non-nuclear powers had felt removed from the planning for
                        weapons which were so fundamental to their security. It was to meet this
                        problem that the nuclear planning committee had been established.</p>
                    <p>While discussing the President's command of nuclear weapons, I emphasized the
                        steps we had taken to prevent accidental or unauthorized use of such weapons
                        (the emphasis on safety precautions and the introduction of such devices as
                        “Pal”) and I indicated our uncertainty as to whether the Soviet Union had
                        given equal attention to these matters. Although he professed that they had,
                        it was clear that he himself had very little knowledge of the extent to
                        which they had protected against accidental detonation or unauthorized use.
                        I emphasized that as the number of nuclear weapons increased it was becoming
                        increasingly important for the political authorities to monitor the steps
                        that the scientists <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0512"/>and military
                        commanders have taken to assure that the weapons would be used only when
                        authorized by appropriate political authorities.</p>
                    <p>3. U.S.-Soviet Strategic Weapons Talks. It was clear that this was the
                        primary subject in which <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was
                        interested. He asked how we expected to approach the talks. I replied that
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> had outlined a
                        possible approach to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on March
                            23<note n="4" xml:id="d195fn4">Not further identified.</note> and we
                        were surprised that to date we had received no reply to our suggestions. He
                        seemed somewhat embarrassed to have to justify the delay and he indicated
                        that it reflected some difference of view in his government as to how to
                        proceed. He stated he would indicate to his colleagues in Moscow the
                        importance we place on such talks and his own view that it would be wise to
                        proceed with them.</p>
                    <p>He asked on what philosophy we would approach discussions of strategic
                        weapons systems. I replied as follows:</p>
                    <p>(A) We believe we must be capable of deterring nuclear or large-scale
                        conventional attacks by members of the Warsaw Pact on any nation of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>(B) We can be assured of having such a deterrent power only if we have a
                        force so strong as to be able to absorb a surprise attack and survive with
                        sufficient power to inflict unacceptable damage on the nations of the Pact.</p>
                    <p>(C) We believe we have that force today; we must provide it in the future;
                        and the quantity of force required for the future will depend to
                        considerable extent upon the actions of the Soviet Union, i.e., we will
                        react to changes in their offensive or defensive force structure.</p>
                    <p>(D) We believe the Soviets' requirement for a deterrent is the same as ours.
                        We believe they have that deterrent today. We believe we cannot prevent them
                        from maintaining it in the future if they act intelligently and if they are
                        willing to use the resources available to them for that purpose.</p>
                    <p>(E) Based on this philosophy, we conclude that if they deploy an
                        anti-ballistic missile system, we must react to it by adding to our
                        offensive power. We have already started to do so. Similarly, if we were to
                        deploy an anti-ballistic missile system to protect our population against a
                        heavy Soviet attack, they would react by increasing their offensive power.
                        Because each of us would be faced with uncertainties, and we more than they,
                        it is probable that after the installation of the defensive system, we would
                        not only be worse off financially but that our security would be less as
                        well.</p>
                    <p>(F) For these reasons, we believe it may be possible to develop a series of
                        actions to be taken by each side, which would reduce the military risks and
                        reduce the financial costs without reducing the deterrent capability of
                        either party and without changing the military balance between the Warsaw
                        Pact and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>The Federal Republic of Germany has objected to our proposal to table a
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty jointly with the U.S.S.R. with the safeguards
                        Article (Article III) left blank subject to further U.S.-Soviet efforts to
                        achieve a joint proposal. They take the position that this might result in a
                        safeguards Article which is harmful to the interests of Euratom. They also
                        propose that we introduce a U.S. draft which would include our safeguards
                        Article, with an additional clause to make clear that inspectors are to be
                        drawn only from countries accepting safeguards inspections on their
                        territory, and with certain other additions to the text which has been shown
                        the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday<note n="2" xml:id="d196fn2">Presumably May 14.</note> the Germans,
                        acting on instructions from the Foreign Minister, changed the emphasis on
                        this approach to indicate that, although their basic position is that they
                        still favored tabling two separate complete drafts, they would accept as a
                        fall-back the tabling of a joint draft with Article III left blank, provided
                        we assured them</p>
                    <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0514"/>
                    <p>(1) that we would obtain an understanding with the Co-chairman that we would
                        attempt to negotiate out an Article III privately, and</p>
                    <p>(2) that if the subject of Article III was nevertheless raised in the
                        Plenary, the U.S. would state that it considered an Article III like that
                        which we have been discussing with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        as an essential condition for Western approval.</p>
                    <p>In this fall-back position the Germans are now, in effect, asking that if, as
                        is most likely, the Soviets won't at this time accept the German-preferred
                        Article III and we table a joint draft with a blank Article III, the U.S.
                        would in any future discussion of safeguards in Geneva become the spokesman
                        for the German position.</p>
                    <p>The fact that the Germans are backing off from their opposition to the
                        tabling of a joint draft with Article III blank is in itself an encouraging
                        sign. I believe a decision to table a separate U.S. draft treaty now would
                        seriously jeopardize the prospect of achieving U.S.-Soviet agreement on a
                        treaty. It would leave the Soviets free to introduce—or reintroduce—various
                        ideas of their own which we and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        would find unacceptable. It is most unlikely that any worthwhile treaty
                        could be concluded in the absence of U.S.-Soviet agreement.</p>
                    <p>Nor can we object to the first of their conditions, namely that the U.S.
                        would obtain an understanding with the Soviets that we would attempt to
                        negotiate out an Article III privately and that multilateral discussion at
                        the Conference of safeguards would be suspended pending availability of
                        language protecting Euratom interests to which the Soviets could agree.</p>
                    <p>My recommendation is that, if the Soviets will agree to this procedure—as I
                        believe they may—we proceed to table a jointly-recommended draft in the
                            <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> with Article III, safeguards,
                        initially left blank.</p>
                    <p>I have considerable difficulty with the second German condition. The German
                        condition is based on a realistic assumption; it is certain that the Indians
                        and others among the Eight will take an initial position that a safeguards
                        Article should apply to the peaceful activities of all countries, both those
                        which do and those which do not have nuclear weapons. We can accept this,
                        but it will put great pressure on the Russians who will reject it.</p>
                    <p>There is no reason that this discussion should be to our disadvantage. The
                        United States need not assume the responsibility for the fact that the
                            <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> is not considering such an
                        Article. We are justified in making it quite clear that it is the continuing
                        refusal of the U.S.S.R. to accept safeguards on its territory that prevents
                        acceptance of a non-discriminatory article. We can use this position as a
                        basis for establishing a consensus at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> in support of the position recommended by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> that <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        inspectors are to be drawn only from countries accepting inspectors on their
                        territories.</p>
                    <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0515"/>
                    <p>It is not clear that this tactical advantage would extend to obtaining
                        general support for the relationship between regional inspection systems (in
                        particular, Euratom) and <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> which the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has in mind. We should make every
                        effort to reach agreement on this point and we should tell the Germans that
                        we will do so. However, we should not now lose all flexibility on this
                        subject by promising that it will be our current draft of Article III or
                        nothing. We should rather indicate to the Germans that if we fail to obtain
                        agreement on this approach, we would have to reassess the entire safeguards
                        issue if it continues to stand in the way of an otherwise worthwhile treaty.
                        We should indicate that we will do so through full <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consultation and taking into account the views of all our
                        allies. We should point out that the purpose of this negotiation is not to
                        impose a treaty on anyone but to reach a treaty which all governments can
                        accept in good spirit. This will involve extended negotiations in the period
                        ahead which will be carried on in full consultation with our allies both in
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and in capitals. We will expect the
                        Western Four in the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> to be fully alert
                        to protect the interests of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The further point made by Minister von Lilienfeld on behalf of Chancellor
                            <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> was for a treaty of limited
                        duration. The suggestion was that the treaty should either be limited to a
                        period of 20 years or signatories should be able to accede for a limited
                        period. The Italians have suggested an even shorter duration clause and I
                        believe that other key countries will also want to limit the treaty's
                        duration.</p>
                    <p>It is most unlikely, however, that we could, at this time, negotiate a
                        limited duration clause with the Soviets who would see it as the result of
                        German pressure. This problem would be eased with the Soviets if it became
                        clear that it was being raised by other countries. Moreover, the question of
                        duration is closely linked with the amendment, review, and withdrawal
                        provisions that are finally agreed upon. We, therefore, believe we should
                        defer consideration of the duration issue until such time as we can see that
                        a meaningful treaty is taking shape. If, as we expect, a number of other
                        governments raise the duration issue, we ought to be prepared to think
                        seriously about a treaty of limited duration provided it is long enough to
                        accomplish the purpose of the treaty. We should not indicate to other
                        governments anything specific on this subject at this time but rather
                        indicate our willingness to consider all relevant questions with respect to
                        the treaty, including the question of duration, in consultation with other
                        governments and our own Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that you authorize me to convey these views to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and, while recognizing the Chancellor's
                        political problems, to indicate that the possibility of achieving a mutually
                        satisfactory resolution is increased if the idea of a treaty of limited
                        duration does not appear to be a German initiative.</p>

                        Presidential approval of Crosstie II. (<persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>, Journal, Volume 15, page 377) This memorandum, however,
                        has not been further identified. A total of eight nuclear weapons tests were
                        conducted under Crosstie II, including Gasbuggy, a Plowshare test, which was
                        tested at Farmington, New Mexico; the remaining tests were conducted at the
                        Nevada Test Site. (<hi rend="italic">United States Nuclear Tests, July 1945

                    <p>A request for approval of Crosstie III was forwarded to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> in a December 22 letter from
                            <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>. Crosstie III consisted
                        of 18 tests including 6 deferred from Crosstie II due to “programmatic and
                        technical difficulties.” Specific requests for approval of Cabriolet and

                        including Cabriolet; authorization for Buggy I continued to be handled as a

                        including Cabriolet and Buggy I. All tests took place at the Nevada Test
                        Site, except for Faultless which was conducted in Central Nevada. (United

                        approval. (Ibid.) A total of 15 tests, all conducted at the Nevada Test

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked: How soon could the
                        obstacles be overcome and a non-proliferation treaty completed, including
                        the achievement of agreement among the eighteen nations at Geneva?</p>
                    <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0518"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> replied that once we
                        tabled a draft, with or without an agreed paragraph on controls, the problem
                        would lie with governments who have not yet seen the text; for example,
                        India and Japan. He made clear that the U.S. does not have pledges from
                        other governments. The U.S. and the Soviet Union may present the draft but
                        then these principal problems would arise:</p>
                    <p>—assurances for India;</p>
                    <p>—the question of the length of the treaty, where the Italians and others seek
                        a length that is something short of eternity, perhaps 25 or 30 years;</p>
                    <p>—finally, both U.S. and Soviet Union will be pressed on the question of
                        reducing and controlling nuclear arms as between themselves.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> interposed that if you accept
                        general and complete disarmament, that would settle it; or we might have a
                        general provision in the preamble of the treaty indicating we would do our
                        best to move towards disarmament.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then asked if we had seen the
                        draft given by Soviet Union to India.<note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">Not
                            further identified.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said we have an
                        important constitutional problem in giving nuclear assurances from the
                        Executive Branch. This would require putting the matter as treaty to Senate,
                        where a 2/3 majority vote is required. If we worked via a resolution in the
                        Security Council, we could avoid this difficult constitutional and
                        procedural matter.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the Soviet draft was
                        based on and rooted in the Charter of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> if he had also gotten the
                        impression the Indians had separated the non-proliferation treaty from the
                        matter of assurances.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that he had always
                        thought the statements of assurances would be made in connection with the
                        treaty. They were flexible as to whether they would be attached in some way
                        or be made as an accompaniment to the act of concluding the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> repeated the point that
                        if we made a unilateral statement of assurance we would have to be careful
                        because of the constitutional problem involved for the Executive Branch.
                        Operating through the Security Council would be easier. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then said: What would our position be
                        if the Indians did not insist on assurances, and asked if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had any more information. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said Indians had raised the matter
                        in connection with the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said one problem might
                        arise: If the Indians asked for assurances, the other non-nuclear powers
                        might ask for them.</p>
                    <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0519"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that the statement
                        made would not be adapted specifically to India but to non-nuclear powers in
                        general.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said there might be
                        differences of views as among non-nuclear powers as to what kind of
                        assurances are required: Some might want stronger language than in the draft
                        the Soviet Union gave to India.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then asked if the U.S.
                        and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> tabled an incomplete draft soon,
                        could the treaty be completed—perhaps by October?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that seemed reasonable
                        if the main obstacles were removed.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed: Let us try
                        for October.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> repeated: That is reasonable,
                        very reasonable.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said we must wrestle
                        with problems of control.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that except for Western
                        Europe, there is no problem.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said we can't command
                        Western Europe. The three communities of Western Europe have a new chairman,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>, a Belgian. He had urged him
                        to go deeply into the matter of the Euratom-Geneva control question. The
                        ultimate problem is with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                        Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he had gotten the
                        impression in Paris that the French favor the treaty. They probably do not
                        plan to sign it, but they are not definite even on this point.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said they also take the
                        view that Euratom must exercise its own controls.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied: Let Euratom also use
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said U.S. is not member
                        of Euratom. We engage in technical cooperation with it but we have no direct
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said: Try to explain to them
                        that their position makes trouble for the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>: The question poses great difficulties. It is impossible to
                        combine bloc and international principles of control. The three-year
                        transitional period doesn't help. They must have an international system.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said if the French were
                        to discover its attitude were an obstacle to the treaty, it is possible they
                        would change their mind.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said it is better you explain
                        this to the French.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said our ability to
                        persuade General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is
                        somewhat limited. He then went on to ask <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> if he anticipated that the Soviet Union would be willing
                        to have its peaceful atomic installations inspected by <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that is a U.S.
                        privilege; the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> shall not do so.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked: What are the
                        difficulties?</p>
                    <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0520"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said there is no need for it.
                        If you wish to, that's all right. But not for the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> pointed out that
                        acceptance by the Soviet Union, as well as by the U.S., would have good
                        effect on Japan and India which were concerned with discrimination. In cases
                        where discrimination is not required for non-proliferation, it would be wise
                        to avoid it. It would be helpful if Soviet Union and U.S. would demonstrate
                        that fact themselves. It would make a deep impression on countries which
                        might make trouble in accepting the treaty.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> concluded that when the text
                        is sent to the Committee of Eighteen, four months ought to be enough to
                        complete work. The target date of October was good. If possible, the treaty
                        ought to be concluded sooner.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked when we would have
                        a common text.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that depends on when we
                        overcome our differences on controls. On other matters, we are closer than
                        before.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the Chairman and the President are now talking about it. He urged
                        U.S. to pay attention to the question of controls, which must be
                        international.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said we find ourselves
                        in a difficult situation. If we could give ourselves three years beginning
                        now, we could gain time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said what happens if the
                        three years run out and there is no solution? But, he said: We do not
                        exclude the possibility of submitting the treaty with a blank Article III.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said we would work hard
                        on this question.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> urged Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> to look into it again and try to find
                        common ground and try to convince our allies.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked if the Soviet
                        Union had again talked to the French.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said: Just in passing. He
                        thought that Debre had mentioned Euratom.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> pointed out that the
                        problem was not Euratom installations in France. France, as nuclear power,
                        takes the view that the Geneva safeguards cannot be applied on its
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said: Why not have both
                        Euratom and <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said Soviet Union may
                        underestimate the strong interest within the Euratom group against further
                        nuclear powers in Europe; for example in Belgium and Netherlands. The Soviet
                        Union should have more confidence in the Euratom safeguards system.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he was not against the
                        system but there was no organic connection between an international system
                        and regional system. The two systems are different in scope and membership,
                        although presumably many tasks would be similar.</p>
                    <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0521"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked if the Soviets had
                        a non-proliferation expert on their delegation?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said: Yes, Vorontsov.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said perhaps Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Adrian Fisher</persName> could get together
                        with him later.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> noted that the Latin
                        Americans had concluded an agreement on a nuclear free region.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked: Was the agreement
                        formalized?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> replied, not yet. They
                        have to clear up the alleged distinction between a nuclear explosion and
                        nuclear weapons. But the missing piece of the puzzle is Cuba. Did <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> have any idea what the Cuban
                        position was.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he didn't know but
                        thought they had stated their position two years ago. So far as he knew,
                        their position had not changed.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he had the
                        impression the issue had been raised by some Latin American countries with
                        Cuba and they had gotten a negative reaction. He expressed the hope
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would use Soviet
                        influence to get them to join the Latin American agreement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he didn't know much
                        about it. The Soviet Union had not been consulted. The question does not
                        relate to the Soviet Union; but he thought Cuba had stated its position
                        before at General Assembly in 1965.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he thought the
                        Latin American agreement a good idea as example for other regions—the Middle
                        East, for one. But these agreements don't work if there is one country
                        outside.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said: But if the Middle
                        Eastern nations sign a non-proliferation agreement, the problem would be
                        solved, although he recognized that a treaty on a nuclear free zone went
                        beyond a non-proliferation agreement.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked: Do you expect all
                        Warsaw Pact countries will sign a non-proliferation agreement?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that each will have
                        finally to state its own position.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked whether the
                        non-proliferation question came up in conversation with Prime Minister Moro
                        and the Chairman.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said virtually not at all.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said Italy is against a
                        treaty for eternity.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said it is still a Catholic
                        country. He had talked, however, at great length with <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName>, perhaps two hours. He had explained
                        in great detail the non-proliferation treaty and carried away the impression
                        some points had been misunderstood: For instance, that the Soviet Union was
                        against peaceful uses of atomic energy. He pointed out the Soviet Union was
                        for unlimited uses of atomic energy for science and <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0522"/>industry. He had the impression that his
                        explanation to <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName> had been
                        helpful.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said some countries
                        misunderstood this question of the industrial uses, but those
                        misunderstandings had now been overcome.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated also on question of
                        nuclear explosions, <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName> understood
                        better than before that there was no difference between explosive devices
                        and weapons.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said there were two
                        points he would like to make. First, he would greatly regret if the tabling
                        of the draft were delayed because of differences over control, and second,
                        the US was ready to go to work on the question of control with the Soviet
                        Union, but there should not be substantial delay.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied, it would be better
                        if we could agree. It would save time in the future. But he didn't exclude
                        tabling the draft with a blank Article III. The Soviet Union was against
                        “family control.” There could be several layers of control, if people
                        wished. The Soviet Union is interested in only one layer.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said it could all be
                        done very quickly if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would say yes
                        to our draft.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this was also true, if
                        the US said yes to the Soviet draft.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked: As you interpret
                        your draft on the question of assurances to the Indians and others, would
                        that instrument be put forward inside or outside the Security Council?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter was the basis for their draft. The
                        Indians wanted something more definite.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he was not being
                        negative, but we have problems unless the Security Council has passed a
                        resolution. We can vote for a Security Council resolution.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the Soviet formulation
                        would be all right for given problems in the United States.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>This is a follow-up on our telephone conversation of yesterday evening. For
                        your background I am attaching a copy of the U.S. Draft Article III and the
                        Soviet Draft Article III which we have exchanged to date.</p>
                    <p>As you can see, the primary differences are that the Soviet draft merely
                        provides for the acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards and, by having no time schedule for their application, presumably
                        provides that they should be immediate, while the U.S. Draft holds open the
                        possibility that negotiations between the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and the authorities of another international safeguards system
                        (e.g. Euratom) should come to a mutually satisfactory arrangement under
                        which the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> verifies the effectiveness
                        of the other system.</p>
                    <p>The Euratom countries, and in particular Germany, have a variety of interests
                        in preserving the Euratom system. The first is the very simple one of
                        keeping Euratom going and their feeling that they could not do so if they
                        attempted to put Euratom facilities under the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards over the objection of one Euratom member, that is,
                        France. If Euratom safeguards were to disappear, then an element of
                        discrimination would be injected into the Community in that France would be
                        the only Euratom country without safeguards on its peaceful activities.</p>
                    <p>The problem is complicated by the common ownership of nuclear fuels and the
                        presence on the territories of four members of facilities which are owned
                        and operated by Euratom and, hence, immune from the jurisdiction of the
                        state on whose territories they are located.</p>
                    <p>Another concern is, of course, based on the feeling of Euratom members that
                        the economic and political objectives which they hope to obtain through
                        Euratom will be jeopardized if they do not negotiate with the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> on a group basis so far as matters within
                        the competence of Euratom are concerned.</p>
                    <p>One possible way of handling this concern has been suggested by a variety of
                        sources, including an informal suggestion by a Soviet delegation officer in
                        Geneva. It would provide for negotiation of “bilateral or multilateral”
                        agreements with the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. This concept is
                        similar to that of <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0524"/>the safeguards
                        provision of the Treaty of Tlatelolco (<gloss target="#t_LANFZ1">LA-NFZ</gloss>).<note n="2" xml:id="d199fn2">The Treaty for the
                            Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (also known as the
                            Treaty of Tlatelolco) was signed in Mexico City on February 14, 1967,
                            and entered into force April 22, 1968. The United States is not a party
                            to this Treaty. For the English language text of the Treaty, see 22 UST
                            762. For specific reference to Article 13, the safeguards provision, see
                            ibid., 772.</note> It would permit individual or collective
                        negotiations, and thus permit Euratom countries to deal as a group with the

                        interests. If you would like new draft treaty language along these lines
                        before your discussions with the Soviets at Glassboro tomorrow or any other
                        time, I will be available on an on-call basis.</p>
                    <p>You will recall that, in your letter to <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Willy

                        Lilienfeld made a demarche yesterday stressing the importance of adhering to
                        this understanding.</p>
                    <p>You also may wish to discuss with the Soviets the possibility of facilitating
                        the handling of the Euratom point by having both the U.S. and the Soviets
                        make an offer to put at least some of their peaceful activities under
                        safeguards. This would, to all intents and purposes, eliminate the Euratom
                        arguments. We believe that the Soviets have a number of facilities (e.g.
                        power and research reactors) devoted solely to peaceful purposes which they
                        could offer to be safeguarded by the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        without affecting their military programs. A talking paper on this subject

                    <p>Each non-nuclear-weapon State Party to this Treaty undertakes to accept the
                        safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency on all its peaceful
                        nuclear activities. Each State Party to this Treaty further undertakes not

                        material or for the production of fissionable material for peaceful purposes
                        to any non-nuclear-weapon State, unless such material and equipment are

                    <p rend="center">TALKING POINTS ON SOVIET ACCEPTANCE OF <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> SAFEGUARDS</p>
                    <p>1. US considers that, to overcome charges of discrimination in safeguards
                        article requiring mandatory safeguards and to gain acceptance of such
                        article, it may well prove necessary for nuclear-weapon signatories to offer
                        to accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on at least some
                        of their peaceful nuclear facilities. Such an offer would apply only after
                        entry into force of an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> with the desired
                        safeguards article. The justification for exclusion of any facilities from
                        offer would be on military or security grounds and not for any commercial
                        reasons.</p>
                    <p>2. Accordingly, US is prepared to make such an offer in order to facilitate
                        acceptance of a safeguards article which requires mandatory safeguards and
                        which is mutually acceptable to the US and the Soviets. We have indication
                        that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> prepared to join us in offer.</p>
                    <p>3. While US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> offer may be sufficient to
                        gain widespread agreement on acceptable safeguards article, such agreement
                        may also require some degree of Soviet acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards. US hopes that <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be able to offer to place at least
                        some of its peaceful <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0527"/>facilities
                        under IAEA safeguards, and accompany US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in a joint or parallel offer at the appropriate point in the
                        negotiations. However, US for its part would be prepared to make offer
                        without Soviets and without <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. Properly presented, such a US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-Soviet
                        offer should not only greatly facilitate acceptance of safeguards article,
                        but could go far toward meeting non-nuclear-weapon states' demands for
                        balanced obligations.</p>
                    <p>5. If Soviets are interested, we are agreeable to coordinating timing and
                        manner of presenting offers for maximum beneficial effect.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background-Noforn</p>
                    <p>1. Recent cables indicate Soviet knowledge of possible US offer to accept
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on peaceful nuclear
                        facilities and Soviet thoughts on making similar offer.</p>
                    <p>2. The approximate numbers of Soviet peaceful nuclear facilities which could
                        be placed under <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards are nine
                        power reactors and twenty-three research reactors (including reactors
                        estimated to be operational by 1968). The above totals exclude reactors
                        designed for military use or for dual plutonium/power production, maritime
                        reactors employing Soviet submarine reactor technology, and reactors located
                        in or very near sensitive installations.</p>
                    <p>3. The Soviets could probably afford to have <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards applied to all, or at least most, of the
                        thirty-three reactors listed above without significantly impairing their
                        plutonium supply for weapons purposes. The amount of plutonium produced in
                        these reactors is estimated to be only a small percentage of the plutonium
                        the U.S.S.R. produces and will produce for weapons purposes.</p>
                    <p>4. The Soviets have peaceful uses for significant amounts of plutonium. For
                        example, at present a single Soviet research reactor uses a quantity of
                        plutonium in its core which is almost equivalent to the total estimated
                        annual amount of plutonium presently produced in all peaceful reactors.
                        Also, they will need a large quantity (1000 kg) of plutonium for peaceful
                        purposes in the early 1970's for the plutonium core of their BN-350 fast
                        breeder reactor, presently under construction.</p>
                    <p>5. The Soviets have held closely the location and technology of fuel
                        fabrication and fuel reprocessing plants, and we do not expect any such
                        plants to be part of any offer to accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards. Most probably all such plants are mixed
                        military/peaceful facilities to some extent, but undoubtedly have primary
                        emphasis on their military aspect.</p>
                    <p>6. The following tabulation, listed for purposes of comparison with the
                        U.S.S.R. peaceful program, includes approximate totals of peaceful U.S. and
                        U.K. nuclear facilities which could be offered for <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguarding. The totals include facilities estimated to
                        be operational by 1968.</p>

                        a comprehensive test ban was quite appropriate in the light of our stated
                            policy.<note n="2" xml:id="d200fn2">For <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s reply, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1967</hi>, pp.
                            294-298. On June 29 Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MA12">Myrdal</persName>,
                            the Swedish Representative to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>,
                            delivered a statement to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> in
                            which she urged that a ban on underground nuclear weapon tests be
                            considered in any discussion of a comprehensive test ban. (Ibid., pp.
                            272-278) Several days later Charles Johnson informed Walt Rostow in a
                            July 7 memorandum of the views of several agencies on <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s proposed draft response to
                            Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MA12">Myrdal</persName>'s statement. In his
                            memorandum, Johnson emphasized to Rostow that “<gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> believes strongly that we must rebut Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MA12">Myrdal</persName>'s charge that we have lost
                            interest in the <gloss target="#t_CTB1">CTB</gloss> because failure to

                        that our present commitments to our defense requirements may be in conflict
                        with the interpretation made by some that given adequate inspection we are
                        prepared to accept immediately a comprehensive test ban treaty.</p>

                    <p>You will recall that at a Meeting of the Principals about a year ago,<note n="3" xml:id="d200fn3">Regarding this meeting, see Seaborg, Journal,
                            Vol. 26, pp. 312-316.</note> we discussed our policy regarding a
                        possible threshold test ban treaty of a comprehensive test ban treaty. At
                        that time certain estimates were made regarding the period of underground
                        testing that might be required in order to complete the accelerated testing
                        of nuclear weapons that then might be regarded as indispensable for future
                        security.</p>
                    <p>Since that time our requirements for these new weapons have been further
                        clarified and our careful and detailed analysis of possible accelerated
                        weapons development and test programs has given us sufficient additional
                        information to indicate that the time estimates of a year ago cannot now be
                        considered to be realistic. Therefore, the Atomic Energy Commission believes
                        that it might be useful to give you a brief assessment of the situation as
                        it now exists.</p>
                    <p>As you know, the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> are currently developing a complete new
                        generation of weapons for the strategic offensive forces. Both development
                        and proof tests are required for these high priority systems. Additionally,
                        since these new systems will constitute the major U.S. response to the
                        Soviet ABM deployment, it is vitally important that there be assessments of
                        their vulnerability to nuclear attack. This requires exposure of components
                        and assemblies to large fluxes of neutrons, gamma and X-rays that can only
                        be provided by nuclear detonations. The development of the techniques for
                        carrying out these nuclear effects tests within the constraints of the
                        limited test ban treaty has been an important achievement of recent time.</p>
                    <p>The requirement for continued underground testing is further emphasized by
                        the Spartan 6 <gloss target="#t_MT1">MT</gloss>, “hot” X-ray <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> warhead. Development and confirmation
                        testing of this warhead by underground techniques involves efforts at least
                        through 1970 because a capability to test at this yield must also be
                        developed.</p>
                    <p>The need to test has not been and presumably will not be entirely dependent
                        on developments for the future stockpile. There have been instances in which
                        nuclear testing was the only solution or that which offered the highest
                        degree of confidence with respect to the urgent correction of defects found
                        in stockpile weapons affecting either operational reliability or safety.</p>
                    <p>I had personally hoped that the necessary underground testing associated with
                        the development of the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> weapons systems
                        could be accelerated so that the results would be available at an earlier
                        time; however, I cannot find a way, despite a great deal of personal
                        attention to the problem. I realize the advantages of taking steps beyond
                        the present limited test ban treaty as soon as it is feasible and I continue
                        to be hopeful that we can reach some broader agreements with the Soviets.</p>

                            this memorandum Foster informed the President that in the U.S. text of
                            the Treaty which was recommended to the Soviets, Article V, the
                            amendments' clause, contained two alternatives. Foster wrote, “The first
                            alternative provides only the nuclear weapon parties with a veto on
                            amendments, but does not oblige any party to accept amendments which it
                            does not approve. The second alternative provides a veto for the nuclear
                            weapons parties and all other parties who are members of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> Board of Governors, but also provides
                            that once adopted amendments are applicable to all.” The United States
                            preferred the first, and informed the Soviets and its allies of this,
                            though either was acceptable. The Soviets, however, preferred the

                    <p>On several occasions over recent years the Arms Control and Disarmament
                        Agency has made clear that a U.S. decision to deploy an anti-ballistic
                        missile defense system would have serious consequences for U.S. arms control
                        objectives. In a speech to the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Conference

                        how we believe that <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment would
                        exacerbate the strategic arms race. This effect was also made clear in
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s statement to
                        Congress on January 23, 1967,<note n="3" xml:id="d202fn3">Presumably a

                        deployment were limited, we still believe it would pose serious risks to our

                    <p>The ultimate decision with respect to deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system will, of course, be made in the
                        light of the total range of considerations affecting U.S. security,
                        including the Chinese Communist build-up and the Soviet failure to date to
                        agree to the initiation of discussions on controlling the strategic arms
                        race. If these considerations were to lead to an early U.S. decision to
                        initiate deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system
                        notwithstanding the adverse effects of such a decision on U.S. arms control
                        objectives, I believe it would be essential that certain actions be
                        undertaken by the U.S. Government in order to minimize insofar as possible
                        these adverse effects. In particular, every effort must be made to avoid
                        such a U.S. decision from preventing the maximum acceptance of and continued
                        adherence to a non-proliferation treaty by non-nuclear-weapons countries.</p>
                    <p>With this objective in mind, I am forwarding herewith for your consideration
                        a paper suggesting various actions which might be taken by the U.S.
                        Government in the event of a U.S. decision to deploy <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s. I and my representatives will be glad to discuss this

                        DEPLOYMENT DECISION</p>
                    <p>If a U.S. decision were to be made to deploy an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system along the lines of the “I-67 Program” (an area defense
                        system with hard-point defense of some Minuteman complexes), then extremely
                        important arms control considerations would have to be taken into account
                        prior to the announcement of any such decision. Such a deployment would
                        probably be based upon and justified by the emerging Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capabilities and the continued Soviet
                        offensive missile buildup; the area defense component would provide
                        protection against Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s and
                        possible accidental launches, and the hard-point defense of Minuteman would
                        decrease the vulnerability of this component of our assured destruction
                        capability by raising the “cost” to the Soviets should they attempt a
                        counterforce first strike.</p>

                    <p>Such a U.S. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment decision at this

                        objectives:</p>
                    <p>1. Preventing the further proliferation of nuclear weapons by obtaining
                        maximum acceptance of and continued adherence to a Non-Proliferation Treaty
                            (<gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>);</p>
                    <p>2. Controlling the offensive and defensive strategic arms race between the

                    <p>3. Assuring the continued adherence to existing arms control agreements;

                    <p>4 Maintaining continued U.S. Government support of stated U.S. policy
                        positions on important arms control proposals; specifically, the cutoff in

                        the Comprehensive Test Ban (<gloss target="#t_CTB1">CTB</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>The potentially adverse consequences of a U.S. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment decision on the foregoing arms control objectives
                        could be minimized by the following recommended specific actions:</p>

                    <p>a. The emerging Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> threat as a
                        primary basis for our decision;</p>
                    <p>b. The “limited” nature of the planned deployment and our intentions to keep
                        it “limited”;</p>
                    <p>c. The hard-point defense of Minuteman as a partial response to continued
                        Soviet offensive missile buildups, and as posing no threat to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> per se;</p>
                    <p>d. The increasing importance of achieving meaningful private discussions
                        between our two nations on ways of controlling the strategic arms race in
                        order to prevent any misunderstanding as to the nature of any deployment and
                        to avoid further escalation of the strategic arms race;</p>
                    <p>e. The importance and urgency of showing some progress in other arms control
                        areas, such as meaningful discussion on controlling the strategic arms race,
                        in order to secure the widest possible acceptance of and adherence to the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>; and</p>
                    <p>f. The increasing pressures of many of our respective allies for their own
                        offensive and defensive strategic systems and associated nuclear warheads if
                        they observe a continued strategic arms buildup by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the U.S.</p>
                    <p>2. Private discussions with NATO prior to announcing our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment decision,<note n="6" xml:id="d202fn6">Note: The U.S. must be prepared to discuss the issues
                            involved in <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment at the
                            Disarmament Experts' Meeting in Paris, September 12-15, 1967, and at the
                            Ankara <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss> Meeting, September 28 and 29,
                            1967. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> emphasizing the first four
                        points under “1” above as well as:</p>
                    <p>a. The emerging Chinese missile threat is not directed towards Europe;</p>
                    <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0534"/>
                    <p>b. There are no hardened strategic missile deterrent forces in Europe
                        suitable for hard-point <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>, future French solid IRBM silo deployments
                        are not a part of U.S. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategic
                        missile deterrent);</p>
                    <p>c. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses of overall urban populations
                        against present and future Soviet offensive missile capabilities are not
                        feasible at this time for either Europe or the U.S.;</p>
                    <p>d. Some U.S. defense against the emerging Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> threat can provide the U.S. more flexibility in its
                        actions in support of its allies and friends around the world;</p>
                    <p>e. The fact that the Soviets were the first to initiate <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment and the very limited nature of
                        our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment need not cause a new
                        spiral in the U.S.-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> strategic arms
                        race; and</p>
                    <p>f. Such an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment decision should not
                        decrease in any way importance and desirability of an equitable <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> to other nations.</p>
                    <p>3. Private discussions with Japan prior to announcing our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment decision emphasizing:</p>
                    <p>a. The continued deterrent value of the overwhelming strategic superiority
                        that the U.S. will possess for the foreseeable future over the Communist
                        Chinese, and the continued utility of this strategic deterrent in protecting
                        the vital interests of Japan;</p>
                    <p>b. Our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment in face of an emerging
                        Chinese offensive missile capability is supplemental to our strategic
                        deterrent forces and is designed to decrease U.S. vulnerabilities to
                        possible Chinese threats of attack and thereby enhance the credibility of
                        our commitments to Japan and other friendly nations (we do not consider
                        China to be an irrational adversary);</p>
                    <p>c. The U.S. is firmly committed to achieving an equitable <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and does not consider that a U.S. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment decision should in any way
                        decrease the desirability of an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> to other
                        nations. In fact, for the reason indicated in “b” above, the need for
                        nuclear weapons by nations friendly to the U.S. will be reduced as will the
                        utility of nuclear weapons to nations which may be enemies of the U.S.; and</p>
                    <p>d. Our willingness to continue to hold detailed discussions with Japan on the
                        overall ballistic missile defense problems—technical, military, economic,
                        and political.</p>
                    <p>4. India will also require timely consultations, particularly in light of the
                        growing Chinese threat and current <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                        negotiations. Shortly after the announcement of our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment decision, a high-level discussion with Indian
                        representatives should take place emphasizing the same first three points
                        made with Japan (see “3 a, b, and c” above) and the points to be made public
                        under paragraph “5” below. With India one should also emphasize that the
                        U.S. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment decision is one of the
                        least provocative U.S. responses to the continuing Soviet offensive missile
                        buildup and the emerging Chinese missile capabilities.</p>
                    <p>5. At the time that the U.S. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment
                        decision is made public, the following points should be clearly stated and
                        emphasized by senior U.S. officials:</p>
                    <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0535"/>
                    <p>a. While the U.S. has demonstrated its reluctance to initiate <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment, this was the only prudent
                        decision in face of an emerging Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability and our need to protect our Minuteman force against
                        the continued buildups in Soviet offensive missile capabilities;</p>
                    <p>b. The limited scope and purposes of the planned <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment emphatically stating that such deployment need not
                        trigger a new strategic arms race between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and that the U.S. still desires
                        meaningful discussions with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on
                        ways for controlling the overall strategic arms race involving both
                        offensive and defensive weapons systems;</p>
                    <p>c. The U.S. continues to consider the achievement of an equitable <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> as a priority goal;</p>
                    <p>d. The U.S. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment decision in no way
                        interferes with or detracts from stated U.S. positions involving important
                        U.S. arms control objectives; and</p>
                    <p>e. The planned <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment will not
                        require any nuclear tests which are inconsistent with the present LTB.</p>
                    <p>6. Specific talking papers on the arms control considerations of our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment should be prepared for use by
                        our ambassadors and other senior officials in various private and public
                        forums shortly after our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment
                        decision is made public.</p>
                    <p>Early consultations within the U.S. Government on the above-proposed course
                        of actions should be held and specific actions agreed to in order that
                        necessary staff-level preparations may be completed on a timely basis.</p>

                    <p>Having reflected on it overnight, I am convinced that it would be very
                        undesirable, domestically and internationally, to announce in mid-September
                        a decision to deploy a limited <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system.
                        The unusual procedure <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0536"/>of a special
                        mid-September announcement<note n="2" xml:id="d203fn2">In a speech delivered
                            on September 18 to the United Press International Editors and
                            Publishers, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> discussed
                            the current U.S. defense policy toward prevention of a thermonuclear
                            war, and specifically about the possibility of deploying an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense system. For text of this
                            speech, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1967</hi>, pp. 382-394. Additional

                        international attention on the decision and associate an undesirable urgency
                        with the program. If the decision must be made, I believe it would be much
                        wiser to announce it in January in connection with the many issues in the
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1969 budget.</p>
                    <p>Domestically, I do not believe that the announcement will make anyone happy.
                        Those opposed to <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment will not be
                        mollified by the limited nature of the system which they will consider as
                        simply a foot in the door for a major deployment. Those in favor of an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment will consider it an
                        inadequate program that does not serve the basic purpose for protecting the
                        US population from Soviet attack and will immediately press for an expansion
                        of the system. The military strategists who desire further protection of our
                        retaliatory missile force will consider the program entirely inadequate
                        since it backs off from the minimum program previously considered in the
                        Pentagon and apparently eliminates all hard-point defense for Minuteman.</p>
                    <p>If made in January, the announcement would be submerged to some extent in the
                        many other problems and decisions in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1969 budget. The anti-<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> forces
                        would probably be somewhat appeased by the restraint on other strategic
                        systems where <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> will
                        presumably be holding the line against the military; and the pro-<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> forces would be more aware of the
                        competition for funds and the severe budgetary limitations on a broader
                        system at this time.</p>
                    <p>Internationally, the decision will be received, no matter what <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> says, both as a major step-up in
                        the nuclear arms race and as an impressive demonstration that the Chinese
                        have achieved the status of a major nuclear power. In this context, a
                        mid-September announcement would have a particularly adverse effect on the
                        prospects for the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. It would clearly be
                        seized upon by India, which has not yet committed itself on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and has always called for a reversal in the
                        US-Soviet nuclear arms race, as an additional reason for not supporting the
                        treaty. This will still be a problem in January. However, if we can get
                        India further committed on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> in the
                        next few months, we might then have more success with the argument that
                        India and others would have greater assurance that we would in fact respond
                        to Chinese nuclear aggression provided we had a limited anti-Chinese <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the Soviets, while the argument can be made that an early
                        deployment decision would increase the pressure on the Soviets to <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0537"/>discuss the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> problem, I think that on balance it would reduce whatever
                        small prospects there might otherwise be for such talks this year—certainly
                        given <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s emphasis on our
                        massive strategic superiority.</p>
                    <p>In summary, I can see no real reasons or political advantages in announcing
                        an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment decision at this time and
                        some real problems that such a decision would create for the Administration.
                        I recommend therefore that if the decision must be made it should be
                        announced in January in the context of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1969 budget.</p>

                        August 28 memorandum to Secretary Rusk, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Walt Rostow on “Arms Control
                        Considerations of a U.S. Anti-Ballistic Missile Deployment Decision.”<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">See <ref target="#d202">Document
                        202</ref>.</note> When it became apparent that things were moving toward a
                        decision to initiate deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        system, I spoke to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and
                        to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> urging that
                        the announcement of such a decision be delayed, and pointing out its adverse
                        effects on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> negotiations.</p>
                    <p>A decision, however, has been made to have Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> announce the U.S. plan to deploy
                        a thin <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system in a speech which he will

                        Disarmament Experts Meeting later in the afternoon of the same day for a
                        discussion of some of the implications, including those relating to arms
                        control.</p>
                    <p>I know that the announcement on September 18 will pose very real problems for
                        the current <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> negotiations. Hopefully, we
                        will be able to arm you with the kind of statements recommended in
                        Recommendation 5 of the contingency paper which I circulated in my
                        memorandum of August 28.<note n="4" xml:id="d204fn4">See the enclosure, <ref target="#d202">Document 202</ref>.</note> We will be working on a
                        contingency statement that you can use in Geneva to meet the excepted

                        deployment as a peg on which to hang criticism of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> effort. In any event I did want you to be
                        forewarned of the planned announcement.</p>
                    <p>I am sure you will want to take the September 18 announcement into account in
                        weighing the pros and cons of an early <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>
                        adjournment. It certainly will not be easier in Geneva after the 18th and it
                        might well be better not to provide some of the opponents of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> with a ready-made forum after the 18th.</p>
                    <p>The September 18 announcement is being treated here as a most sensitive
                        subject and I would suggest that you limit knowledge of it to yourself and

                        III. For Secretary and Fisher from Foster.</p>
                    <p>1. Summary: At September 1 Co-Chairmen's meeting at <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName>'s initiative, Soviets presented
                        Foster with text of draft Art III (sent septel).<note n="2" xml:id="d205fn2">For the Soviet draft of Article III, see <ref target="#d206">Document
                                206</ref>.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> said there were many
                        elements of draft which would <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0539"/>be
                        troublesome for Moscow to accept, but that his delegation had taken into
                        account views presented by US regarding special Euratom problems. <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> said he considered draft best
                        possible compromise between US and Soviet positions. He could not predict
                        whether it would be acceptable to his superiors but would recommend it to
                        Moscow for acceptance. Foster said he would report draft presented by Soviet
                        delegation as basis for solution to Art III impasse. Foster said not sure
                        that Washington would find Soviet draft satisfactory either to US Govt or
                        its allies. However, he recognized that Soviet draft represented
                        considerable departure from earlier Soviet position on <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> safeguards and that it had been the result
                        of fruitful exchange of views between delegations. Foster said he would
                        recommend Soviet draft to Washington as something US Govt should try out on
                        US allies.</p>
                    <p>2. Details: <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> asked for
                        Co-Chairmen meeting Sept 1 in order to present Soviet compromise proposal
                        for Article III. <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> noted that
                            <persName corresp="#p_BG5">Bunn</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GC3">Gleysteen</persName> on US side and Antyasov and
                        Shustov on Soviet side had debated two drafts following Aug 26 Co-Chairmen's
                        meeting (Geneva 629).<note n="3" xml:id="d205fn3">Telegram 629 from Geneva,
                            August 26, reports: “At August 26 <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> luncheon, Foster reviewed tactical situation in
                                <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>, saying it most important to
                            have <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> recommendation of <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> in some form before draft passed on to

                            could not endorse <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> as a committee
                            without unanimity, but saw no problem in finding procedural means to
                            report to <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> submission <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> by Co-Chairmen and status of debate on
                            it in <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> considered it essential to reach Co-Chairmen
                            agreement on safeguards and security assurances as soon as possible in
                            order that <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> would be easier defend at

                            U.S. and Soviet drafts on Art. III, pointing out deficiencies and
                            loopholes of Soviet draft. Foster also pointed out need for Soviets to
                            start moving on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s and conventional
                            arms transfers before too late.” (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>-I Files,

                            1967)</note> Soviets had obtained greater insight into safeguards
                        problems as result Aug 26 and earlier Co-Chairmen's meetings and problems
                        their draft Article III posed for US and its Euratom allies. These points
                        had been further clarified during informal meetings of Deloffs. Foregoing
                        had made it possible for Soviet delegation to present draft Art III which
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> thought takes into
                        account problems of US and special interests of Euratom allies. <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> said Soviet draft had not been
                        discussed with Moscow and he was not sure whether it would be acceptable,
                        but he was prepared to recommend it as best possible compromise between
                        Soviet position that <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards apply
                        to all non-nuclear-weapon signatories and US position that Article would
                        have to take into account political realities of US alliance structure.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said he would recommend
                        Soviet draft as something to try out on Washington and on our allies. Foster
                        said that while we are anxious to resolve Art III issue before <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> draft is moved on to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, we of course would have to obtain views of allies before
                        tabling any Co-Chairmen draft on Art III. While he personally hoped Soviet
                        draft might provide basis for compromise of conflicting interests and
                        recognized that <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0540"/>Soviets had made
                        important concessions, he could only say he would recommend draft to
                        Washington for presentation to US allies.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> agreed that utmost discretion
                        required to avoid leaks.</p>
                    <p>5. Several days after Co-Chairmen's meeting of 26 Aug, Antyasov and Shustov
                        invited Bunn and Gleysteen to meet. Soviets suggested that Soviet Art III be
                        utilized but that following language be added to it: “The above-mentioned
                        guaranties shall apply to the states as provided for in the statute of the
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and the document on safeguards.”
                        Soviets contended that our Euratom allies could enter into “bilateral or
                        multilateral” arrangements with <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        because they were provided for in <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        statute and safeguards document. They also said they thought some of our
                        allies would like a specific reference to the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards document.</p>
                    <p>6. We said Soviet suggestion inadequate because it did not contain language
                        from US Art III on following points:</p>
                    <p>(1) Clear statement of purpose of safeguards in beginning;</p>
                    <p>(2) Right of Euratom members to enter into verification agreement with <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> through Euratom and related provisions
                        recognizing important role of Euratom;</p>
                    <p>(3) Application of safeguards to “source or special fissionable material
                        within its territory or under its jurisdiction” rather than to “its nuclear
                        activities” as in Soviet text;</p>
                    <p>(4) Three-year transition period;</p>
                    <p>(5) Language re economic and technological development and safeguarded
                        international interchange of nuclear materials and equipment;</p>
                    <p>(6) More precise language for export provision.</p>
                    <p>7. Subsequently Soviet Deloffs presented US Deloffs with text substantially
                        same as text reported septel except for first sentence. They said they could
                        not accept US statement of purpose because it referred to “source or special
                        fissionable material” and Moscow would suggest addition of “principal
                        nuclear facility.” As to other references to “source and special fissionable
                        material” in US text, they could perhaps be accepted provided language from
                        safeguards document on when procedures applied to principal nuclear
                        facilities could be added. (See second and third sentences of para 1 of text
                        reported septel.)</p>
                    <p>8. Soviet Deloffs could not accept language US Art III referring to other
                        safeguards systems and verification agreement for Euratom although they
                        understood Euratom would enter into an agreement with <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> on behalf of its members covering their
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> safeguard obligations. Soviets said
                        Moscow would reject word “multilateral” but language “individually or
                        together with other states” might be acceptable. They would not accept
                        three-year transition period; they had guidelines permitting only year and
                        one-half transition; but perhaps language of <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0541"/>para 4 which based on <gloss target="#t_LA1">LA</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_NFZ1">NFZ</gloss> Treaty<note n="4" xml:id="d205fn4">On February 12, 1968, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> advised the President to sign Protocol II of the Latin

                            treaty, see 22 UST 762.</note> would satisfy Moscow as compromise.
                        However, Soviets could not accept language like first sentence of provision
                        in <gloss target="#t_LA1">LA</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_NFZ1">NFZ</gloss>
                        Treaty; an undertaking to accept safeguards was required for them. US
                        Deloffs said they would report above to <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>.</p>
                    <p>9. At the Co-Chairmen's meeting which occurred today, <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> to consider the first sentence of the text reported
                        septel as a substitute for the US language on statement of purpose. Soviet
                        Deloffs said “nuclear energy” was vague and should be understood to include
                        “source and special fissionable material” which they could not accept in
                        first sentence of treaty. (Comment: It clearly does not include nuclear
                        “facilities.”)</p>

                    <p>704. Disto. For Secretary and Fisher from <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>. The text of the Article III suggested to us by the
                        Soviet Delegation today is as follows:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Begin verbatim text</hi>: Draft Article III.</p>
                    <p>1. Each non-nuclear-weapon state party to the treaty undertakes to accept
                        International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards with a view to preventing
                        diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other
                        nuclear explosive devices for the exclusive purpose of verification of the
                        fulfillment of the obligations assumed under this treaty. As provided in the
                        Agency's safeguards system, procedures for the safeguards required by this
                        Article shall be followed with respect to <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0542"/>source or special fissionable material whether it is being
                        produced, processed or used in any principal nuclear facility or outside any
                        such facility. These procedures shall also extend to facilities containing
                        or to contain such materials, including principal nuclear facilities. The
                        safeguards required by this Article shall be applied on all source or
                        special fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear activities within the
                        territory of such state, under its jurisdiction, or carried out by it
                        anywhere.</p>
                    <p>2. Each state party to the treaty undertakes not to provide: (a) Source or
                        special fissionable material, or (b) Equipment or material especially
                        designed or prepared for the processing, use or production of special
                        fissionable material, to any non-nuclear-weapon state for peaceful purposes,
                        unless the source or special fissionable material shall be subject to the
                        safeguards required by this Article.</p>
                    <p>3. The safeguards required by this Article shall be implemented in a manner
                        designed to comply with Article IV of this treaty, and to avoid hampering
                        the economic or technological development of the parties or international
                        cooperation in the field of peaceful nuclear activities, including the
                        international exchange of nuclear material and equipment for the processing,
                        use or production of nuclear material for peaceful purposes in accordance
                        with the provisions of this Article.</p>
                    <p>4. Non-nuclear-weapon states party to the treaty may conclude agreements with
                        the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> to meet the requirements of this
                        Article either individually or together with other states as provided in the
                        statute of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. Negotiation of such
                        agreements shall commence within 180 days from the original entry into force
                        of this treaty. For states depositing their instruments of ratification
                        after the 180-day period, negotiation of such agreements shall commence not
                        later than the date of such deposit. Such agreements shall enter into force
                        not later than eighteen months after the date of initiation of negotiations.

                        Soviets agree schedule talks. If this is the case I strongly believe we
                        should not make further approach to Soviets unless we can tell them frankly
                        that announcement will be made. Otherwise they will have good case for
                        charging bad faith and canceling talks with great damage to our position
                        before world opinion. If not possible tell them our intentions now, believe
                        we should proceed promptly with announcement at same time expressing our
                        desire proceed with strategic arms control talks. While our announcement
                        would make more difficult Soviet agreement to talks, we could stress that
                        they are already carrying out deployment.</p>
                    <p>2. If we can give firm indication our intention make announcement, I believe
                        would be useful for me to take up the matter informally with both <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, particularly if I could tell them that if they
                        schedule talks we will be prepared present more concrete proposal.</p>
                    <p>3. My own view is that we should go further and put forward proposal now. We
                        know Soviet military opposed and in absence of specific proposal they can
                        conjure up all kinds of pitfalls in arguing against talks as well as
                        argument that US not sincere and merely wishes obtain information on Soviet
                        capabilities and plans. (<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        indicated to me civilians found it difficult to counter military arguments
                        on this highly technical subject.) Also in event Soviets continue fail to
                        open talks we will be in much stronger position when our decision deploy
                        announced if we had put forward serious proposal. I believe if specific
                        proposal made Soviets will in fact at least agree to discuss it.</p>
                    <p>4. Since Soviet military position clear, believe attempt to advance
                        consideration through military channels likely be counter-productive.</p>
                    <p>5. Re last question reftel, from Soviet point of view public emphasis that
                        deployment necessitated by Chicom developments has both pros and cons. From
                        ours I am inclined to view we should avoid taking any official position on
                        this as uncertainty would bring more pressure on Soviets to negotiate. Might
                        be helpful state that our basic position based <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0544"/>on deterrence. We recognize interest of Soviets that
                        deterrence be mutual and that we always stand ready to work out arrangements
                        for both sides to achieve security at lowest practical level.</p>

                    <p>The Soviets have proposed a compromise Article III dealing with safeguards
                        which represents movement from their earlier position.<note n="2" xml:id="d208fn2">For text of the Soviet proposal submitted by <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> at the Co-Chairmen's meeting

                        weapon states enter into safeguards agreements with the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> “either individually or together with
                        other states as provided in the statute of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>” and the statement that the “exclusive purpose” for which
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards are to be accepted is
                        “verification of the fulfillment of the obligations assumed under this
                        treaty.”</p>
                    <p>These two factors appear to indicate that the Soviets are prepared to permit
                        arrangements under which <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> could make
                        use of the Euratom system in performing the task of “verification” under
                        such an Article. The Soviets also appear willing to have an Article III
                        which permits the Euratom countries to negotiate with <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> through Euratom.</p>
                    <p>The new Soviet article also contains a two-year implementation period after

                        have to obtain the views of our allies on the Soviet compromise proposal. We

                    </list>
                    <p>In his Nodis cable, dated September 2,<note n="2" xml:id="d209fn2">See <ref target="#d207">Document 207</ref>.</note> on strategic arms control
                        talks, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>
                        recommended that we put forward a specific strategic freeze proposal prior
                        to the announcement of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> decision.
                        Although I recognize that on the present schedule there is probably not
                        enough time to work out any proposal within the US Government, I have
                        nevertheless given some thought to what form such a proposal might take. In
                        order to be useful in the present circumstances and time scale, the proposal
                        would have to have the following characteristics:</p>
                    <p>—simple in concept so that it can be easily understood without complex
                        explanations;</p>
                    <p>—acceptable to all the interested elements within the US Government (<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, and
                        State). This means that from the US point of view it must clearly be to our
                        over-all military advantage and consistent with the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment decision;</p>
                    <p>—interesting to the Soviets and difficult politically for them to ignore. To
                        this end, it should be forthcoming in accepting some Soviet position and/or
                        containing some new element in their interest.</p>
                    <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0546"/>
                    <p>I believe the proposal outlined below would be consistent with the above
                        criteria and would provide a reasonable basis on which to start discussions.
                        Although it lacks some of the elements that have been considered in the
                        past, such as an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> freeze, it would
                        certainly be better than nothing.</p>
                    <p>My proposal would consist of the following specific elements:</p>
                    <p>1. Freeze on any new starts on fixed land-based strategic missile launchers
                            (<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, IRBMs, <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s). This provides a substantial basis of interest for the
                        Soviet Union since they would be allowed to complete the large number of
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites now under way. Although it
                        has been generally recognized inside the US Government that we would have to
                        make this concession in any negotiable proposal, we have never to my
                        knowledge specifically made the offer to the Soviets. If we make it clear
                        that we are not trying to undercut the current Soviet building program, the
                        Soviets would have a real incentive to agree before we start an expansion of
                        our force.</p>
                    <p>2. Freeze on new construction of ballistic or cruise missile submarines. We
                        have hedged on this proposal in the past apparently on the grounds that
                        unilateral intelligence is inadequate. Actually, our intelligence on
                        launched subs is extremely good. Any subs that have not already been
                        launched would have to be declared to be permitted. This proposal would
                        appear very forthcoming on our part and would be greatly to our military
                        advantage. Even the Navy should be able to recognize that it could be to our
                        advantage to stop or drastically limit the construction by the Soviets of
                        the new class of Polaris-type (16 or more missiles) submarine which recent
                        intelligence has identified.</p>
                    <p>3. Choice of either (a) no restriction on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        deployment, or (b) limitations on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        deployments for population defense to the same negotiated number of
                        launchers (or missiles) in the US and Soviet Union. While expressing a
                        preference for the latter approach, we would leave the choice to the Soviets
                        since they have questioned the desirability of placing any limitations on
                        defense. The approach of limiting launchers (or missiles) to the same number
                        would leave open the question of the function of the Tallinn system for the
                        time being. In the unlikely event it indeed has a significant <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability, we would have the option of a
                        rather substantial <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment. If the
                        Soviet deployment is limited to the Moscow system, we would have placed a
                        reasonably tight ceiling on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployments
                        while retaining the flexibility to undertake part or all of the proposed
                        1-67 Nike-X deployment.<note n="3" xml:id="d209fn3">See <ref target="#d207fn3">footnote 3, Document 207</ref>.</note> Time and
                        negotiations would clarify this situation. Even though it complicates the
                        verification job, we probably should use missiles rather than launchers as
                        the unit of measure <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0547"/>since we know
                        that both the Tallinn and Moscow systems have more than one missile per
                        launcher while the proposed US system would have a separate launcher for
                        each missile. As a starter, this formulation would exclude deployments
                        intended exclusively for the hardpoint defense of strategic missiles since
                        these might be particularly difficult to sort out from air defense and would
                        in any event only contribute to a secure deterrent posture.</p>
                    <p>4. Verification of the agreement would be based solely on unilateral
                        capabilities. This would accept the Soviet position on verification.
                        Although our own thinking has also been based on this premise, our previous
                        proposal to the Soviets was ambiguous on this point and could have been
                        interpreted as meaning that we wanted to include provisions in the agreement
                        that would require formal verification or inspection.<note n="4" xml:id="d209fn4">Not further identified.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Since that which is not prohibited would be permitted, we and the Soviets
                        would both be able to pursue qualitative improvements in our existing
                        missile systems to whatever extent we desired. We, for example, would
                        presumably continue the Poseidon, <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s,
                        and Pen Aids; and the Soviets would presumably continue FOBS (fractional
                        orbiting bombardment system) and whatever other qualitative improvements
                        they have in mind.</p>
                    <p>I am not very hopeful of getting the Government to focus on this issue at
                        this time. I do believe, however, a proposal along the above lines would be
                        mutually advantageous to the Soviets and ourselves and would give the
                        Soviets a concrete proposal to consider if that is what they need to force a
                        decision to initiate the proposed strategic discussions.</p>

                        follows:</p>
                    <p>“I would like today to give you a further report on the US Government's
                        thinking with respect to the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> problem. I
                        should here stress to you that there has as yet been no announcement in the
                        US of the decision of my Government, described below, concerning <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment. We expect to make this decision
                        known shortly, but we wanted you to be aware of it in advance in line with
                        the promise that I made last March to keep you advised of our thinking on
                        this matter. Meanwhile, I must urge that what I say here today be held in
                        the strictest of confidence. Of course, you will wish to advise senior
                        officials in your own governments about the major points made in my
                        statement.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> problem has, as you know, been a
                        matter of interest in the Alliance for some months. Last March I described
                        to the Council our efforts to open discussions with the Soviet Union to
                        limit competition in strategic arms.<note n="2" xml:id="d210fn2">No specific
                            record of this communication with the Council or of a Council meeting
                            has been found. However, Fisher expressed hope in his undated Memorandum
                            for the President (see attachment 2 to <ref target="#d189">Document
                            189</ref>) that following <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s March 9-16 European trip to consult with the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, a meeting of the North Atlantic Council would be held
                            as soon as possible.</note> Since then we have made several efforts to
                        open discussions with the Soviet Union, and the matter was discussed at the
                        Glassboro meeting between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Premier Kosygin.<note n="3" xml:id="d210fn3">President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Soviet

                            discussion of world problems in two separate sessions, June 23 and 25 at
                            Glassboro, New Jersey. The two leaders devoted their discussions
                            primarily to the crisis in the Middle East, the Vietnam war, efforts to
                            halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons, limitations on anti-ballistic
                            missile systems, and bilateral U.S.-Soviet relations. Documentation on
                            this meeting is scheduled for publication in <ref target="frus1964-68v14">

                        far not agreed to initiate serious talks. We are, however, continuing to
                        press them to begin conversations.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, our own analyses of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        problem and the difficult and complex examination of whether or not to begin
                        deployment of any <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system has continued,
                        and has brought us to the point where we expect now to announce soon a
                        decision to deploy a limited system consisting of an 'area' defense of the
                        United States together with a 'terminal' defense of some Minuteman sites. In
                        general, the planned deployment has two purposes: to provide protection
                        against the sort of missile attack which the Chinese might be capable of
                        launching during the 1970's, and to protect our Minuteman missiles against a
                        possible counterforce attack by the Soviets. We expect to have an initial
                        operating capability in 1972. The deployment in question is scheduled to be
                        completed by 1974.</p>
                    <p>I also want you to understand why it is that we are proposing to initiate
                        this deployment. As I indicated above, we are doing this for two reasons—to
                        provide area protection for the US against the sort of unsophisticated
                        attack which the Chinese might be able to mount in the 1970's and to protect
                        Minutemen missiles. These two points may be considered separately.</p>
                    <p>With respect to China, I should start with a brief summary of our current
                        estimate of Chinese objectives and capabilities. It is clear that the
                        Chinese are placing a high priority on the development of nuclear weapons
                        and means of delivery. It now appears to us that a principal <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> objective is to develop as rapidly as
                        possible an intercontinental missile force capable of delivering nuclear
                        weapons. We believe that they could have an initial <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> operational capability as early as the early 1970's, and
                        that they might deploy a significant number of operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s by the mid-1970's. Their initial system
                        will be relatively crude and highly vulnerable, and they will not be capable
                        of penetrating even a thin <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense such
                        as we have described above.</p>
                    <p>With respect to defense of the Minutemen, let me stress that by doing this we
                        are hedging against a possible future improvement in the Soviet force, not
                        against the present threat. We have, over the past several years, examined
                        several ways of improving the survivability of the Minuteman. We have
                        concluded that an ABM defense for at least a portion of our Minuteman force
                        is the best means of insuring their survivability. We will thus insure the
                        undiminished assured destruction capability of our landbased strategic
                        missile forces. I may add that it is to this assured destruction capability,
                        and not to any defensive measures, that we look and will continue to look
                        for the deterrence of a Soviet attack against our own populations and those
                        of our Allies.</p>
                    <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0550"/>
                    <p>As Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> made clear at
                        the <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss> meeting last April,<note n="4" xml:id="d210fn4">See <ref target="#d195fn3">footnote 3, Document
                            195</ref>.</note> we will not attempt to defend our cities against the
                        sort of sophisticated missile attack the Soviets are already capable of
                        launching. We believe that the Soviets, like ourselves, can and will respond
                        to any threat to their Assured Destruction capability by making the
                        appropriate offsetting improvements in their offensive forces. We have no
                        plans to create a large scale urban defense directed against Soviet
                        missiles. We intend to make this clear to the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>We also believe, on the basis of discussions with some of the major Asian
                        countries, that our deployment of a limited ABM defense will help to
                        reassure them and will reduce the pressures for acquisition of independent
                        nuclear capabilities in Asia.</p>
                    <p>We intend to explain our decision to our friends in Asia as we have to you,
                        making particularly clear that it is not based on any major changes in our
                        assessment of the Chinese threat, but is a prudent security measure which
                        will enhance the security of all.</p>
                    <p>We believe that it remains highly desirable and feasible for the US and the
                        Soviet Union to discuss means of limiting competition in strategic arms. In
                        fact, our current action may even stimulate more serious interest in such
                        discussions by the Soviets. We think there are ways in which to define an
                        agreed limited level of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment which
                        would meet the objectives outlined above and not require other complex
                        compensatory actions by the two major powers. As I have told you, we have
                        not had much success in developing such discussions to date but we intend to
                        keep trying. We are informing the Soviet Union of our decision and
                        forthcoming announcement, and at the same time strongly reaffirming our
                        belief that we should promptly enter into discussions on possible ways to
                        limit the strategic arms race.</p>
                    <p>We also believe that this decision should in no way interfere with the
                        conclusion of the non-proliferation treaty. In so far as the defense is
                        directed against China, it should in fact make clear that the US intends to
                        counter Chinese nuclear capability. Thus, those countries which fear the
                        growth of Chinese nuclear capabilities need not feel that their only
                        alternative is to create a costly nuclear arsenal themselves.</p>
                    <p>We are prepared to continue to consult through such mechanisms as the
                        Disarmament Experts who will be meeting today, and the <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss> which will be meeting later this

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> has been instructed to
                        inform Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> that the
                        U.S. Delegation is prepared to stay in Geneva as long as necessary to reach
                        agreement on Article III of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. We
                        would fully expect, however, to reach agreement by the end of October
                        because as a practical matter it would be very difficult to defer an <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> report to the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> much beyond that time.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Council of Ministers is meeting today
                        and tomorrow<note n="2" xml:id="d211fn2">The <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Council of Ministers met in Brussels.</note> and it is
                        hoped that they will develop a Euratom position on the draft Article III
                        proposed by the Soviets. We expect to learn by tomorrow whether we shall be
                        receiving these views before the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting
                        on October 6. If we are not going to have Euratom's position before October
                        6, we propose to inform all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> capitals
                        on October 4 of U.S. views on the Soviet proposal and what amendments and
                        understandings we believe to be negotiable with the Soviets.<note n="3" xml:id="d211fn3">In an October 2 memorandum from Foster to <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> recommended that the United States inform its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies of its position on the Soviet
                            Article III draft. According to <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, “If we were to wait until next week to make our
                            position known to our allies, precious time will be lost and might
                            result in a situation in which we found ourselves having to start
                            discussions in Committee I with a blank Article III. This in turn would
                            encourage non-aligned countries to make other unacceptable suggestions.
                            If this were to happen matters could easily get out of our control and
                            that of the Soviets.” Foster further proposed that all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> capitals except Paris receive an
                            aide-mémoire to be delivered on October 4 outlining the U.S.
                            Government's position. (Washington National Records Center, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 383, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_D1">D</gloss> Files: <gloss target="#t_FRC1">FRC</gloss> 77 A 52, Memoranda to the Secretary of

                        Euratom allies and the Soviets in the next week or two, there is danger that

                    <p>Following discussions in New York at dinners between U.S. and Soviet
                        officials, and consistent with the suggestion of Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> invited me to luncheon at the Soviet Embassy to
                        continue discussions particularly concerning non-proliferation.</p>
                    <p>I reported to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that
                        the Euratom meeting at which we had hoped for additional comments on the
                        Soviet compromise draft Article III did not consider this subject. In view
                        of that we were continuing our efforts to obtain the views of our allies and
                        Euratom but that a further delay would occur. We went over once more the
                        problems already foreseen with the present Soviet compromise draft mainly
                        having to do with the question of facilities and the references to IAEA and
                        its negotiating authority in relationship to that of Euratom and of the <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0553"/>maintenance of Euratom as an entity
                        owning materials and facilities as well as operating a safeguards system. I
                        stated that we had not submitted the latest revision of paragraph 4 of the
                        Soviet compromise draft since to start with we thought it was a
                        retrogressive step and we hoped that they would accept our suggestion for
                        rearrangement of the first sentence of paragraph 4. He did not seem
                        concerned about the possibility of their accepting our suggestion on this
                        but did not wish to comment in detail in view of my statement of possible
                        further changes. In the circumstances he asked whether there was anything
                        for them to do on this article at the moment, and I said I thought not but
                        that, hopefully, we would soon be back to them with possible other
                        suggestions felt to be essential by our allies.</p>
                    <p>We then discussed suggestions the Mexican, Indians, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, and Sweden made in recent meetings at Geneva. It was his
                        feeling that we should attempt to get all suggestions on the table for
                        consideration by the Co-Chairmen and recommendation to the Committee when
                        all suggestions were in. He thought, as we do, that certain of the Mexican
                            proposals<note n="2" xml:id="d212fn2">For text of Mexican Representative
                            Castaneda's statement to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>,

                        were possibly acceptable but felt that many of the others could not be
                        accepted.</p>
                    <p>I indicated that some of our allies were concerned about unlimited duration
                        for the treaty and wondered whether the Soviet Union had given consideration
                        to this question since Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> talked about it in
                            June.<note n="3" xml:id="d212fn3">Following the Glassboro Summit in New
                            Jersey June 23-25, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> met with
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> who was attending the
                            U.N. General Assembly in New York on June 26 and 27. There they
                            continued to discuss the topic of disarmament that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Soviet Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had earlier discussed at the
                            Summit. For an account of the June 23 meeting, see <ref target="#d198">Document 198</ref>.</note> He said that they had not since they
                        continued to believe that an unlimited duration treaty was important and he
                        mentioned once more the thousand year figure. I asked whether Foreign
                        Minister Miki of Japan in his talks on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> had mentioned the Japanese suggestion of periodic five-year
                            conferences.<note n="4" xml:id="d212fn4">Foreign Minister Miki delivered

                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he saw no real purpose
                        in such periodic reviews. I also raised the question of the difficulties
                        which some of the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> members have brought
                        up concerning the very rigid amendments procedure and got no substantive
                        response.</p>
                    <p>On other non-proliferation matters such as the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> recess, the sanctity of Articles I and II, assurances, nothing

                    </p>
                    <p>On another subject, we had an interesting and fairly lengthy discussion of
                        the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> limitation proposal made by the U.S. in January.<note n="6" xml:id="d212fn6">Presumably a reference to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s military posture statement

                            of Defense Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, January
                            25, 1967. For an extract, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1967</hi>, pp.
                        5-24.</note> He said that the reason for no response was not the lack of
                        interest nor lack of attention having been given to the subject, but was
                        because of the differing points of view within the Soviet Government on it.
                        He stated that, unlike the U.S. Government where there appeared to be ready
                        means of coordination on both the political and military aspects of such a
                        proposal, in the Soviet Government the Foreign Ministry dealt primarily with
                        political questions and all military matters were the responsibility of the
                        Defense Ministry. In the Foreign Ministry there were few, if any,
                        individuals having experience and competence in a subject of this sort and
                        the military were unwilling to let the Foreign Ministry discuss the question
                        in any way except what he characterized as “meaningless general terms.” I
                        told him that the U.S. Government had been studying this question not only
                        intensively over the last couple of years but indeed, as he knew, had begun
                        to broach it in the Surprise Attack discussions in 1958. He commented,
                        however, that it was his opinion that when our decision was made to deploy a
                        limited <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system it really was a
                        completely political decision. He wondered therefore whether there could be
                        serious talks about specific military limitations when politically most of
                        the emphasis appeared to be that the U.S. had a superiority of two to three
                        to four times over that of the Soviet Union and that the Congress and the
                        Pentagon in public pronouncements emphasized that the U.S. intended to
                        maintain that. This made it very difficult for those in the Soviet Union who
                        felt that such talks might be useful to convince the military that any
                        serious discussion of limitations and possible reductions was in the Soviet
                        interest. He said, nonetheless, considerations were continuing about how to
                        approach this and he had personally been glad to hear Secretary Rusk's
                        statement at dinner last week<note n="7" xml:id="d212fn7">Presumably during

                    <p>Following the submission of Seaborg's October 10 letter to Rostow, a lively
                        debate ensued about the costs and benefits of granting the Atomic Energy
                        Commission permission to execute Cabriolet. For example, Foster wrote a
                        memorandum to Walt Rostow on October 17 recommending disapproval of
                        Seaborg's request. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> feared that
                        Cabriolet could violate the Limited Test Ban Treaty and complicate, perhaps
                        fatally, current negotiations on the non-proliferation treaty. (Johnson
                        Library, National Security File, Nuclear Testing—Plowshare Events, Volume 2,
                        Box 29) For an extract from this memorandum, see Seaborg's Stemming the
                        Tide, page 335.</p>
                    <p>The following day, in an October 18 memorandum to Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MLC1">Leonard Meeker</persName> recommended an indefinite postponement of
                        Cabriolet and underscored Foster's reservations. Meeker argued, in part, “It
                        is difficult to imagine a more unfortunate time for the conduct of
                        Cabriolet. The situation at the General Assembly seems virtually certain to
                        ensure that there will be well-publicized charges of treaty violation, with
                        the U.S. being taxed for shaving its own obligations at the same time it was
                        asking the non-nuclears to engage in a further round of self-denial. The
                        domestic political repercussions could be substantial.” (Department of
                        State, Central Files, AE 6)</p>
                    <p>However, on the same day, Herman <persName corresp="#p_PH7">Pollack</persName>, Director, Office of International Science and
                        Technology Affairs, Department of State, wrote a memorandum, October 18, to
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> arguing that
                        Cabriolet should be executed because it could help rather than impede the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> negotiations. “Conduct of the
                        Cabriolet test on an open basis would demonstrate that we are seriously
                        proceeding with our plans for learning all that is necessary about the yet
                        untested technology in order to make its benefits eventually available to
                        the rest of the world. On the contrary, our sincerity might well be
                        challenged if on the one hand we exhort other countries not to work on
                        Plowshare because they will have access to our services as soon as we
                        develop the technology, and then on the other hand we decline to follow the
                        orderly path of experiments which many scientists throughout the world
                        recognize as necessary to develop our capacity to provide the services we
                        have offered.” (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>, however,
                        agreed with <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MLC1">Meeker</persName> that Cabriolet should be postponed.
                        In an October 20 memorandum to Walt Rostow, <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> wrote: “The <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                        negotiations are at a critical stage. We simply cannot chance giving the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, the Italians, <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0556"/>Indians, etc., an opportunity to charge us
                        with playing games with our own treaty obligations …. I am persuaded that
                        the possible dangers to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>—which is
                        vital to the President—and the hell we would probably catch in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> (and at home) if we went through with the
                        test, are simply not worth the price.” (Ibid.)</p>

                        Principles of the five non-nuclear weapon Euratom countries and a draft
                        Article III embodying these principles to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> in Geneva on November 2.<note n="2" xml:id="d214fn2">See <ref target="#d216">Document
                        216</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said that the U.S. was
                        authorized by its allies to work out an Article III with the Soviet on this
                        basis. However, our allies wish to be consulted before an Article III is
                        tabled. We will try to conduct such consultations in Geneva, but the Soviets
                        should be aware that another meeting of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council may be necessary.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> pointed out that the last
                        two months have involved difficult and intensive consultations. We regret
                        the delay in the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>'s work, but the
                        difficulties we ran into were genuine. These difficulties arose not only
                        from the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> but also from other Euratom
                        countries. It <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0557"/>should be stressed
                        that the “five principles” are backed by all “Five.”<note n="3" xml:id="d214fn3">See <ref target="#d216">Document 216</ref>.</note> The
                        French apparently played a passive role.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> also pointed out that if
                        the Soviets would accept safeguards in some fashion they would find that
                        other countries would be able to accept safeguards much more readily. A lot
                        of objections to particular provisions of Article III would be forgotten if
                        the Soviets themselves were prepared to accept safeguards on their peaceful
                        activities.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> expressed the hope that the
                        Soviets can be flexible in considering our proposals for a compromise
                        Article III. He said there would be no need to alter the basic framework of
                        the September 1 draft.<note n="4" xml:id="d214fn4">Not further
                        identified.</note> The Soviets should assume the meaning of Article III
                        realistically and be flexible about wording.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> then said he understood
                        that Committee I in New York can be kept occupied with non-disarmament items
                        at least until November 15. Perhaps breaking out the Secretary General's
                        report on nuclear weapons would provide additional time. In any event, there
                        is need for speed in working out an agreed Article III. We should aim to
                        complete the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> by November 20 at the very
                        latest since the U.S. and U.S.S.R. share an interest in having it passed
                        through the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> this year and signed as
                        soon as possible thereafter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> then read the first
                        sentence of the draft Article III presented by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName>. He said that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> had told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> that the omission of “<gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>” before safeguards was impossible for the
                        Soviets to accept and represented a major stumbling block. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> argued that inclusion of “<gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>” would not alter the fact that agreements
                        between the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and Parties to the Treaty
                        would have to be concluded. He stressed the importance of making Article III
                        acceptable to the Euratom countries. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> copied down this first sentence and said he would
                        report the issue to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> then read the rest of the
                        first paragraph and noted that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> had objected to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> over the absence of any reference to facilities. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> pointed out that reference
                        to facilities was not essential since this aspect of the problem of
                        effective safeguards is covered by reference to a statute of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards system. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> then outlined the problem concerning the phrase “or
                        carried out under its control anywhere” as a substitute for “carried out by
                        it anywhere.” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> did
                        not seem to think this was an important issue but he noted that this was a
                        matter for experts.</p>
                    <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0558"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> then raised the question of
                        the treaty's duration and said that “1,000 years” does not seem reasonable
                        to many countries. Likewise there are genuine objections to the amendments
                        provision which is too rigid and in practical effect would mean that no
                        amendments to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> probably could ever be
                        adopted. Moreover, politically speaking we had encountered objections to
                        giving a veto to states who were members of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> Board of Governors on the score that some important
                        countries are not permanent members of this Board. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> thought that the provision in the
                        first alternative amendment's provision discussed last summer, which would
                        not make amendments apply to states which did not accept them, was
                            better.<note n="5" xml:id="d214fn5">See <ref target="#d201fn3">footnote
                                3, Document 201</ref>.</note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> made no response to these points.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> then raised the subject of
                        the Soviet draft convention on non-use. He asked whether the U.S.S.R. could
                        really deny itself the option to use of nuclear weapons in a major war.
                        Apart from the circumstances of the Soviet draft convention which will
                        create difficulties for us, we think it is not advisable to raise this
                        subject at the present time when we shall need to cooperate in order to
                        smooth the path for the presentation of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> at the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. It would be very
                        important for both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. to avoid having the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> go back to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> next year. This would mean that the Conference of
                        Non-Nuclear Weapon States would convene in the spring of 1968 and that
                        further difficulties for the nuclear weapon states in connection with the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> would be created.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether we
                        thought that India and Brazil would go along with the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> replied that he did not know. It is possible that the
                        security assurances which we are already discussing with the Soviets would
                        make it easier for India to sign.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he recognized
                        the urgency of completing the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and hoped
                        that there would be a Soviet response to the proposals presented by Mr.

                        five “principles,”<note n="3" xml:id="d215fn3">See <ref target="#d216">Document 216</ref>.</note> which we probably can live with.</p>
                    <p>—We were able to hand to the Russians at Geneva on Thursday<note n="4" xml:id="d215fn4">November 2; see <ref target="#d214">Document
                        214</ref>.</note> a revision of their own draft Article III incorporating
                        much of the five Euratom principles, plus some key language from the German
                        “illustration.” Preliminary Russian reaction was reasonably forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>We still must be particularly careful with the Germans. There is a strong
                        possibility that they will not ratify the N.P.T. even if (as seems likely)
                        they grudgingly sign it. German adherence, however, is vital to the success
                        of the Treaty. Yet we cannot afford to put so much pressure on them that we
                        give nationalists an easy means of attacking Germany's U.S. ties. The
                        political situation comes down to this:</p>
                    <p>—Attitudes among top German politicians and officials range from total
                        hostility, represented by people like Strauss<note n="5" xml:id="d215fn5">Strauss and his followers, who represented one of two powerful, often
                            opposing wings of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union,
                            the former Gaullists, feared that the Non-Proliferation Treaty would
                            preclude the creation of a European Nuclear Force which they considered
                            to be a necessary step toward European unity.</note> and the right-wing
                        press, to grudging acceptance, represented by <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>.</p>
                    <p>—The basic German dissatisfaction with the Treaty makes it easier for people
                        like Strauss to propagate the view that the N.P.T. represents a U.S.-Soviet
                        “deal” made behind Germany's back at her expense.</p>
                    <p>—The N.P.T. is not yet a big public issue; so far the issues it presents have
                        been too complex to capture popular attention. We can be grateful, in fact,
                        that opposition has focused on Article III, perhaps the most complicated
                        aspect of the Treaty, rather than on basic principles. Nevertheless, the
                        danger we face is that someone like Strauss will try to blow the Treaty up
                        into a nationalist issue.</p>
                    <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0560"/>
                    <p>We do not yet know how the Russians will finally react to our revised Article
                        III. If they insist on their original formulation we will face a dilemma:</p>
                    <p>—We must push the Russians hard to meet German concerns regarding Article
                        III. Not to do so would give the Germans an excuse for rejecting the Treaty,
                        and would seriously damage our relations with them. (We can ease things some
                        by close and high-level consultations.)</p>
                    <p>—On the other hand, an impasse with the Russians now would probably make it
                        impossible to put a draft Treaty before this year's <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly and thus could delay the Treaty for as much
                        as a year, if not kill it altogether.</p>

                    <p>The U.S. wishes to inform its allies of the status of the negotiations with
                        the Soviet Union on Article III of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
                    <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0561"/>
                    <p>1. The U.S. draft of November 2. On November 2, 1967, the U.S. Co-Chairman of
                        the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> proposed to the Soviet Co-Chairman
                        the draft Article III which is attached. At the same time, the U.S.
                        Co-Chairman gave the Soviet Co-Chairman the five principles set forth below
                        as well as the text of the interpretations contained in the Aide-Mémoire of
                        October 5, 1967.</p>
                    <p>2. The U.S. November 2 draft and the five Euratom member principles. We
                        believe this text and these interpretations protect the five principles
                        agreed by Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in the
                        following manner:</p>
                    <p>Principle 1: “Safeguards under the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> would
                        be applied to source and special fissionable material and not to
                        facilities.”</p>
                    <p>The November 2 U.S. draft deletes the third sentence of the Soviet compromise
                        text which provided that safeguards procedures “should also extend to
                        facilities …” (Emphasis added). As suggested by some of our allies, the
                        second sentence is retained except for its reference to the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> Safeguards System.</p>
                    <p>Principle 2: “There should be no misunderstanding that as far as <gloss target="#t_EA1">EA</gloss> member states are concerned, safeguards under
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> will be applied on the basis of an
                        agreement to be concluded between <gloss target="#t_EA1">EA</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>.”</p>
                    <p>The first sentence of the November 2 U.S. draft adds language stating that
                        safeguards under <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> would be “as set forth
                        in an agreement to be … concluded with the IAEA.” It also makes clear that
                        these safeguards would have to be “in accordance with the statute of the
                        IAEA ….” The fourth paragraph of the text would permit non-nuclear-weapon
                        states to conclude <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> agreements “either
                        individually or together with other states in accordance with the statute of
                        the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>.”</p>
                    <p>In presenting the revised text to the Soviet Union, the U.S. Representative
                        made clear that the U.S. relies on the provisions of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> Statute dealing both with “bilateral and
                        multilateral arrangements” for safeguards and with “relationship” agreements
                        between <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and other international
                        organizations the work of which is related to that of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. He stated: “The U.S. is of the opinion
                        that this language permits parties to the treaty to negotiate and conclude
                        an agreement with the IAEA through Euratom to carry out their safeguards
                        obligation and that an <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>-Euratom
                        agreement would result from these negotiations.”</p>
                    <p>Finally, the U.S. Representative told the Soviet Representative that the U.S.
                        would state the following interpretation to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> and to the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> Board of
                        Governors: “The first sentence of paragraph 4 of the draft Article III
                        permits the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> to enter into an
                        agreement, concerning the safeguard obligations of the parties, with another
                        international organization, the work of which is related to the IAEA and the
                        membership of which includes the parties concerned.”</p>
                    <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0562"/>
                    <p>Principle 3: “The agreement should be based on the principle of verification
                        of <gloss target="#t_EA1">EA</gloss> safeguards by <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>: the implementation of this principle shall be negotiated
                        between the two organizations.”</p>
                    <p>As this principle recognizes, its implementation must occur in the Euratom
                        negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. As indicated
                        above, the November 2 U.S. draft would permit such negotiations.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the November 2 draft continues the earlier language stating that
                        acceptance of NPT safeguards would be for the exclusive purpose of
                        “verification of the fulfillment” of obligations of the treaty. Moreover,
                        the new language avoids calling <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                        safeguards “<gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.” It makes
                        clear, of course, that they must be in accordance with the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> statute and safeguards system. There is
                        considerable flexibility in both.</p>
                    <p>Interpretive principles dealing with the nature of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>-Euratom Agreement which would be
                        permitted by Article III were also presented to the Soviet Representative.
                        These are the three points set forth in paragraph 5 of the U.S. Aide-Mémoire
                        of October 5. They are as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. “There should be safeguards for all non-nuclear-weapon parties of such
                        nature that all parties can have confidence in their effectiveness.”</p>
                    <p>2. “In discharging their obligations under Article III, non-nuclear-weapon
                        parties may negotiate safeguards agreements with the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> bilaterally or together with other
                        parties, and specifically, an agreement covering such obligations may be
                        entered into between the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and another
                        international organization the work of which is related to the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and the membership of which includes the
                        parties concerned.”</p>
                    <p>3. “In order to avoid unnecessary duplication, the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> should make appropriate use of existing records and
                        safeguards, provided that under such mutually agreed arrangements the IAEA
                        can satisfy itself that nuclear material is not diverted to nuclear weapons
                        or other nuclear explosive devices.”</p>
                    <p>Principle 4: “Pending the conclusion of the agreement between Euratom and
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_EA1">EA</gloss>
                        member states concerned wish to stress that there should be no
                        misunderstanding that the obligations with regard to Euratom (or to its
                        member states) entered into by any party to a <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> shall not be affected by provisions of Article III dealing with
                        supply.”</p>
                    <p>The United States takes this to be more directed toward future action of the
                        U.S. than toward the provision of Article III dealing with supply. This
                        provision is essentially the same as the corresponding provision of the U.S.
                        draft approved in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> on April 20,
                            1967.<note n="2" xml:id="d216fn2">Not further identified.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Like the April 20 draft, the undertaking concerning safeguarded supply of
                        nuclear materials to non-nuclear-weapon states does not <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0563"/>apply until a specified period after the
                        treaty enters into force. This period does not begin to run until a
                        substantial (30-40) number of non-nuclear-weapon states have ratified. These
                        ratifications will probably require substantial time. The U.S., whose
                        ratification is also necessary to entry into force, will obviously have to
                        take into account the status of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>-Euratom negotiations before ratifying. We do not expect any
                        conflict to arise between our <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                        obligations and the supply obligations we have to Euratom and its members.
                        We believe the time available for conclusion of an <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>-Euratom agreement is sufficient, and we do not contemplate
                        failure to achieve agreement in that period.</p>
                    <p>Principle 5: “Euratom member states concerned, determined to act in common,
                        have to be sure that the position of Euratom when negotiating to arrive at a
                        satisfactory agreement with <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> will not
                        be prejudiced by any eventual provision of Article III, as for example on a
                        time period.”</p>
                    <p>Like the U.S. draft approved in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> on April
                        20, 1967, the November 2 U.S. draft contains a time period for conclusion of
                        Euratom's negotiations with <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. Unlike
                        the April 20 draft, the November 2 draft makes that period applicable to
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> negotiations with all states, not
                        just with Euratom members.</p>
                    <p>Without some time period, we see no way to secure worldwide implementation of
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> safeguards. We believe the time
                        period is adequate if there are good faith negotiations on both sides.</p>
                    <p>To sum up our views with respect to the five principles, we believe the
                        November 2 U.S. draft protects them to the greatest extent possible under
                        the circumstances. Insofar as this protection appears inadequate to our
                        allies, they may follow procedures available to any sovereign state to
                        insure that a satisfactory agreement with the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> is worked out.</p>
                    <p>3. Other provisions in November 2 draft. There are two other significant
                        changes reflected in the November 2 draft which do not relate to the five
                        principles but are designed to meet the requests of certain Euratom members.
                        The first is to add the word “control” to the last sentence of paragraph 1
                        so that safeguards would be applicable to nuclear material in a peaceful
                        nuclear activity of a non-nuclear-weapon party “carried out under its
                        control anywhere.” In presenting this change, the U.S. Representative made
                        clear again that Article III would not require the application of safeguards
                        to the French-Belgian or French-German facilities in France.</p>
                    <p>The second such change is to add a provision to paragraph 3 referring to the
                        preambular principle on instrumented safeguards. The last phrase of
                        paragraph 3 would be amended to make clear that safeguards would be
                        implemented in accordance with “the principle of safeguarding set forth in
                        the Preamble.”</p>
                    <p>4. Soviet response to U.S. November 2 draft. At first, the Soviets objected
                        to several key points of the U.S. draft and questioned some of <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0564"/>the interpretations. Then, at a meeting on
                        November 9, 1967, the Soviet Co-Chairman said that he would recommend to his
                        Government as a package all U.S. proposals of November 2 provided the U.S.
                        agreed to a reformulation of the first sentence. He said he would forego
                        introducing other changes only because of the need to make progress as
                        quickly as possible. He said he would wish to make an ENDC statement to the
                        effect that <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards would be
                        generally applicable as the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> safeguards
                        system. He added that he would not take issue with the interpretive
                        statements planned by the U.S.</p>
                    <p>The reformulation of the first sentence involves the deletion of the word
                        “negotiation,” which the Soviet Representative said was superfluous, and a
                        rearrangement of two phrases, which he said was very minor. As revised, the
                        first sentence would read: “Each non-nuclear-weapon state party to the
                        treaty undertakes to accept safeguards, in accordance with the statute of
                        the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and the Agency's safeguards
                        system, as set forth in an agreement to be concluded with the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> for the exclusive purpose of verification
                        of the fulfillment of its obligations assumed under this Treaty with a view
                        to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear
                        weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.”</p>
                    <p>5. U.S. response to Soviet reformulation. The U.S. Representative said he
                        could not recommend this reformulation to his Government since he believed
                        the Soviet should accept the U.S. formulation. The U.S. is now urging Soviet
                        reconsideration at high levels of the November 2 U.S. draft as the one best
                        designed to ensure wide adherence to a non-proliferation treaty.</p>

                            2, 1967</hi>.</p>
                    <p>1. Each non-nuclear-weapon state party to the Treaty undertakes to accept
                        safeguards, as set forth in an agreement to be negotiated and concluded with
                        the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> in accordance with the statute of
                        the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and the Agency's safeguards
                        system, for the exclusive purpose of verification of the fulfillment of its
                        obligations assumed under this Treaty with a view to preventing diversion of
                        nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear
                        explosive devices. Procedures for the safeguards required by this Article
                        shall be followed with respect to source or special fissionable material
                        whether it is being produced, processed, or used in any principal nuclear
                        facility or is outside any such facility. The safeguards required by this
                        Article shall be applied on all source or special fissionable material in
                        all peaceful nuclear activities within the territory of such state, under
                        its jurisdiction, or carried out under its control anywhere.</p>
                    <p>2. Each state party to the treaty undertakes not to provide: (a) source or
                        special fissionable material, or (b) equipment or material especially <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0565"/>designed or prepared for the
                        processing, use or production of special fissionable material, to any
                        non-nuclear-weapon state for peaceful purposes, unless the source or special
                        fissionable material shall be subject to the safeguards required by this
                        article.</p>
                    <p>3. The safeguards required by this article shall be implemented in a manner
                        designed to comply with Article III of this treaty, and to avoid hampering
                        the economic or technological development of the parties or international
                        cooperation in the field of peaceful nuclear activities, including the
                        international exchange of nuclear material and equipment for the processing,
                        use or production of nuclear material for peaceful purposes in accordance
                        with the provisions of this Article and the principle of safeguarding set
                        forth in the preamble.</p>
                    <p>4. Non-nuclear-weapon states party to the treaty shall conclude agreements
                        with <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> to meet the requirements of this
                        article either individually or together with other states in accordance with
                        the statute of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. Negotiation of
                        such agreements shall commence within 180 days from the original entry into
                        force of this treaty. For states depositing their instruments of
                        ratification after the 180-day period, negotiation of such agreements shall
                        commence not later than the date of such deposit. Such agreements shall
                        enter into force not later than eighteen months after the date of initiation
                        of negotiations.</p>

                    <p rend="center">PROJECT CABRIOLET</p>
                    <p>The President: We are confronted with a difficult decision here on
                        “Cabriolet.”</p>
                    <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0566"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>: These are the issues:
                        You are being asked to approve a “cratering” shot important to the future of
                        “Plowshare” program.</p>
                    <p>This is directly related to the Interoceanic Canal and peaceful application
                        of the atom. We first thought that the test ban treaty would not conflict
                        with “Plowshare” program. Now we do not know.</p>
                    <p>We must ask if this shot is sensible only if it is to be followed by other
                        shots which infringe on the test ban treaty. We must ask to what extent do
                        we support Plowshare? There is a problem of possible violation of the test
                        ban treaty. The President should know the parameters of the problem.</p>
                    <p>If there is a 50-50 chance of leakage, we could be in violation of the test
                        ban treaty. We face a 50-50 chance of leakage on these tests. We are at a
                        time when this could get in the way of <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>It is therefore a decision between “Plowshare” vs. the test ban treaty. The
                        treaty requires you to keep the debris from these tests at home.</p>
                    <p>The President: The question is would Cabriolet violate the treaty?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>: There is a 50-50 chance
                        and a danger of a small degree of leakage on this test.</p>
                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>: I gave assurance to
                        the Senate the “Plowshare” experiments could be carried out. That was
                        important to getting the treaty passed.<note n="2" xml:id="d217fn2">Reference apparently is to <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>'s Congressional testimony in support of the Limited
                            Test Ban Treaty. See, for example, his testimony before the Senate
                            Foreign Relations Committee on August 14, 1963, reproduced in Seaborg,
                            Journal, Vol. 6, pp. 162-226.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Probably, there would not be “more hazardous” tests to follow. There would be
                        a need for an amendment to the treaty at a later date for the test ban
                        treaty.</p>
                    <p>On the matter of leakage, the first assumption is that we would have a 20
                        percent chance of leakage. At 50 hours after the test there might be ten
                        picocuriers at the border with Canada. In the air normally were about 100
                        picocuriers. Of this would only be a very small amount which is way below
                        any health hazard and below any sensible level to cause a problem.</p>
                    <p>This would be below the amounts which have resulted from the Soviet test.</p>
                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> said at the time of
                        the treaty Secretary Rusk wrote the Congressional Committee that the U.S.
                        would feel free to interpret the treaty more liberally if the Soviet were
                            to.<note n="3" xml:id="d217fn3">Not further identified.</note> To drop
                        Cabriolet would be to drop “Plowshare.” Brazil and India want a nuclear
                        explosion system of their own. In order to prevent this, we have offered
                        them the Plowshare program.</p>
                    <p>The President: Could you conduct Cabriolet without violation of the test ban
                        treaty?</p>
                    <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0567"/>
                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>: Yes, under a liberal
                        interpretation of the treaty. If debris crosses the U.S. border, it would be
                        detected by our own public health service.</p>
                    <p>The President: Is it your position that in order to keep faith with Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s letter to the Senate we
                        should conduct these tests?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Robert Anderson: The Congress will not give us any more money until this
                        question is resolved. There is no agreed position on the level of radiation
                        that will constitute a violation of the test ban treaty.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ACP1">Anderson</persName> said if we postpone
                        Cabriolet indefinitely then we postpone indefinitely the development of
                        nuclear excavation.</p>
                    <p>He said if we start tomorrow it would take the next fifteen years before we
                        could put the first ship through the proposed oceanic canal. “I do not want
                        to debate what is in violation of the treaty. But it is unfortunate if we
                        have gotten ourselves into the position where we cannot use this type of
                        energy to do this work.”</p>
                    <p>“It will only be after all of these tests are completed that we will actually
                        know if we can go through with a canal by nuclear excavation.”</p>
                    <p>“It is not reasonable for us to impose that fine distinction which will
                        permit the Soviets to do what they have done and not permit us to conduct
                        our test.”</p>
                    <p>“I propose that we announce these tests publicly and give the world time to
                        prepare for it. We should be forthright and honest.”</p>
                    <p>(Inserted as an appendix to these notes is a summary of the recommendation by
                        Mr. Anderson and the Atlantic-Pacific Interoceanic Canal Study

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> said he was opposed to the
                        proposal. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> said that this
                        test would require only 2,500 tons of explosive while about 10 million tons
                        of explosive was needed for the canal.</p>
                    <p>Many think that a one million ton test and a 10 million ton test will be
                        necessary before we can actually decide to go ahead with the canal.</p>
                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>: But these tests
                        would not be for more than three years.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName>: In any case you cannot go
                        further with these tests without modifying the test ban treaty.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>: Why don't we go to the
                        Soviets now or to the Security Council and work this thing out for the first
                        test? Why not get international participation including asking the Soviets
                        to come over here and deal with us in this program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Robert Anderson: The Corps of Engineers say we must conduct these tests
                        before we can determine whether to build a canal. We need this first test so
                        we can learn from it what will be necessary to avoid another delay.</p>
                    <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0568"/>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_SCL1">Schultze</persName>: These tests
                        escalate as you go along. I question whether we should invest money in the
                        research and development test that you recommend when you ultimately know
                        you are going to have to ask for changes in the treaty. It does not make
                        sense economically to spend this money on tests when you are uncertain
                        whether or not you will be able to make meaningful use of this when larger
                        shots are required.</p>
                    <p>The most responsible estimates show that it would not hurt to have a two to
                        three year delay on this. I believe, Mr. President, that we should get the
                        diplomatic problem out of the way first.</p>
                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>: We've tried to talk
                        to the Soviets for two years and we haven't gotten anywhere.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Adrian Fisher</persName>: Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> has been in touch with the
                        Soviets on this and has gotten nowhere.</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: The Soviets have
                        conducted 14 tests between March 1964 and February 1967. We are talking
                        about only kilotons in this test. The Soviets have conducted tests ranging
                        as follows: 450 kilotons, 200 kilotons, 85 kilotons, and 220 kilotons.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName>: But the Soviet tests were
                        well below the surface. Their seepage was highly fractional. These U.S.
                        tests will be near the surface with a better than 50 percent chance of
                        seepage.</p>
                    <p>Undersecretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: There will
                        be a radioactive cloud. We would be violating the treaty. The fact this
                        cloud would go over Canada would make it extremely difficult politically.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have never taken another interpretation. They have never admitted
                        their actions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName>: There will be two types of
                        reaction. Here in this country I know the reaction will be that we have
                        violated the treaty. If the test is detected by other countries, the
                        reaction by them also will be that we have violated the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> then read a statement
                        which the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy had submitted. In this statement,
                        the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy expressed its deep concern over the
                        fact that the Plowshare program had not been carried out as planned. The
                        Committee said it did not like a strict interpretation being placed on the
                        treaty. It pointed out that the Soviets have proceeded with testing very
                        vigorously.</p>
                    <p>The meeting adjourned with no decision being reached.<note n="5" xml:id="d217fn5">A detailed account of this meeting also appears in
                            Seaborg, Journal, Vol. 14, pp. 545-548, and in his book, Stemming the

                    </list>
                    <p>We have reached a point in our <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                        negotiations where we are faced with several alternatives. The treaty is
                        almost complete, except for the difficult safeguards article, Article III,
                        and the question of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>'s duration,
                        which we shall want to reopen. I am bringing the matter to your attention at
                        this time because, at the end of this week or the beginning of the next,
                        there may be some public indications by the non-aligned that the Geneva
                        Conference is failing because of our inability to make progress on this
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the safeguards article, the Soviets have accepted all the
                        changes which we have proposed, except one. They have agreed that safeguards
                        under the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> should be applied pursuant to
                        an agreement with the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> concluded
                        pursuant to the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> Statute. Their
                        position, however, is that the safeguards to be established pursuant to a
                        Treaty should be characterized in the Treaty as “<gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.” I have urged <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to reconsider this position but the Soviets are
                        sticking to it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> is of the
                        opinion that their position on this is definitive (see attachment 1—Geneva
                        telegram 1861).<note n="2" xml:id="d218fn2">Telegram 1861 from Geneva,
                            November 25, drafted by Foster for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, is not printed. (Ibid.) In this telegram, in
                            addition to a discussion of failed U.S. efforts to convince the Soviets
                            to omit mention of “<gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> Safeguards”
                            from their draft Article III proposal, <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> expressed the following about our European
                            allies, particularly the FRG: “I recognize and support the strong
                            feeling of Euratom members that their safeguards must continue and that
                            Euratom, as such, must have the right to negotiate whatever verification
                            procedures by <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> are ultimately
                            applied. Nonetheless, it seems to me that as a Co-Chairman we are now
                            being asked to fight mainly for the interests of only one of our allies,
                            as against our own national interests and those of the most of the rest
                            of our allies and most of the rest of the world.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The area of disagreement is reflected in three possible formulations of the
                        first sentence of Article III (see attachment 2). We have asked urgently to
                        have the views of our Allies on these formulations.</p>
                    <p>Alternative courses of action now open to us appear to be as follows:</p>
                    <p>A. We could press the Soviets to accept our November 2 formulation (which
                        does not so clearly characterize as “<gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>”
                        safeguards the safeguards to be established pursuant to agreement with the
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>) indicating <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0570"/>that this is essential to us and that we
                        must continue to insist on it despite Soviet rejection.<note n="3" xml:id="d218fn3">For text of November 2 U.S. Article III draft, see <ref target="#d216">Document 216</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>B. We could yield to strong non-aligned pressure to interrupt negotiations at
                        Geneva and present an incomplete <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> to the
                            <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> with a blank Article III.</p>
                    <p>C. We could tell our Allies that only the second or third formulations in
                        attachment 2 (which more clearly characterize the safeguards to be
                        established pursuant to agreement with the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and “<gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>” safeguards) offer
                        a realistic basis for negotiations. We could add that prompt agreement along
                        such lines would improve prospects for getting Soviet agreement to a limited
                        duration clause.</p>
                    <p>Implicit in the selection of the language for Article III is the problem of
                        what sort of an agreement we contemplate between <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and Euratom, or, for that matter, between <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and the various countries whose nuclear
                        activities are to be put under <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        inspection. It is my view that such an agreement should provide for full use
                        of existing safeguards systems, such as those of Euratom or those of our own
                        AEC safeguards system, but that it should involve more than a mere
                        examination of the paper records of those systems; it should be deep enough
                        so that <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> could satisfy itself that no
                        diversion was taking place.</p>
                    <p>Alternative A, insisting on our November 2 draft which does not so clearly
                        characterize the safeguards as <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards, will be the most acceptable course to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, Italy and, apparently, Belgium among our
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies as it would strengthen the
                        hand of Euratom negotiating with <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. None
                        of these states (with the possible exception of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>) has indicated that we should insist upon this formulation
                        even if it means the failure of the negotiations for a non-proliferation
                        treaty. On the other hand, our allies who are not in Euratom, as well as the
                        non-aligned, are not interested in pressing for treaty language which
                        appears to preserve a special position for Euratom which has overtones of
                        self-inspection. Many of them have indicated that the U.S. should not press
                        this position to the point of deadlock in the negotiations .</p>
                    <p>Insistence on alternative A to the point of deadlock might lead to
                        alternative B if an apparent stalemate in Geneva leads to pressure to break
                        off the negotiations there and to take the issue to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly with a safeguards Article
                        left blank. This alternative carries a risk that the Article III ultimately
                        agreed upon would offer less protection to Euratom than the formulations
                        currently under discussion. It probably would touch off a round of
                        propaganda recriminations which would not promote prospects for early
                        agreement on an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0571"/>
                    <p>Following the third alternative, characterizing the safeguards system as
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards, would permit the
                        prompt conclusion of the negotiations with the Soviets and prevent any talk
                        of deadlock in the negotiations at Geneva. It would cause difficulties with
                        the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, and to a lesser extent with our
                        other allies who are in Euratom because of their feeling that this
                        characterization would drastically weaken Euratom's bargaining position in
                        the future negotiations with <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. The
                        difficulties with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> might be
                        particularly acute as the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would be
                        forced to decide, on its own responsibility, whether it could accept a
                        characterization of safeguards as <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards.</p>
                    <p>Accepting the characterization of the safeguards as <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards, however, would be in the long range U.S.
                        interest as far as the countries outside of Euratom are concerned. We have a
                        long range interest in promoting <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards as such. It is this interest which underlies our own willingness
                        to place our own peaceful nuclear activities under <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards and it is not served by a refusal to
                        characterize the safeguards of an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> as
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.</p>

                    <p>1. The November 30 <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting on <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> seems to me to have ended rather
                        inconclusively. What we need now are the definitive views of the Euratom
                        countries and particularly those of Germany and Italy.</p>
                    <p>2. Therefore, in advance of this week's <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                            meeting,<note n="3" xml:id="d219fn3">Scheduled for December 6.</note>
                        you should urge the Germans and the Italians to give their definitive views
                        on the alternatives before them, taking into account your presentation on
                        November 30, so that we will then be in a position to know whether we can
                        take advantage of delay in <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> recess
                        until mid-December to attempt to complete the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. You should make clear that delay in <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> recess was accomplished solely for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>3. It seems that our allies have had sufficient time to try to pull
                        themselves together and give us specific governmental positions. Since the
                        last effort to reach an agreed Euratom solution was not successful, I am not
                        too sanguine that any multilateral session as proposed by Dutch would
                        produce a favorable result. Therefore we prefer handle discussions on this
                        subject bilaterally.</p>

                    <p>4. I concur that my presence at <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        Ministerial will provide occasion, if necessary, for further consultations
                        on unsolved <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> problems.<note n="4" xml:id="d219fn4">A Ministerial Meeting of the North Atlantic Council,

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>We have had no further word from our Allies regarding the alternative
                        formulations of the first sentence of Article III since the November 30
                        meeting of the North Atlantic Council when a number of them gave us their
                            reactions.<note n="2" xml:id="d220fn2">Not further identified.</note> At
                        that time it appeared that those allies who are not members of Euratom could
                        accept any of the alternatives. This is also true of Japan, whose views we
                        also solicited. The Netherlands representative in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> highlighted the point that the November 2 draft is no
                        longer a viable alternative.<note n="3" xml:id="d220fn3">For text of
                            November 2 draft, see <ref target="#d216">Document 216</ref>.</note>
                        However, there has been no clear indication of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s views.</p>

                        December. The other ENDC delegations were willing to go along with this on
                        the assumption that this <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0574"/>would
                        facilitate the efforts of the Co-Chairmen to reach agreement on Article III
                        before the ENDC recesses.<note n="4" xml:id="d220fn4">In 1967, the second

                    <p>If we are unable to table an Article III before the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> recesses, there is likely to be a sense of heightened
                        frustration on the part of the non-aligned delegations who have been kept
                        waiting, first by the Soviet delay in agreeing to tabling a draft treaty
                        with a blank Article III until August 24, and later by the delay in an
                        evolution of a definitive Western position on Article III, a phase we are

                        they insist that we continue to push the November 2 language which the

                        for a conference after 25 years to determine by a majority vote whether the
                        treaty should continue indefinitely or for another fixed period, and would
                        permit any party to withdraw from the treaty at that time.</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>/Euratom Negotiations. He proposed
                        that Euratom begin preliminary discussions with <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> on the form of a safeguards system while we continue
                        negotiations on the text of Article III. Such informal discussions should
                        pose no problem; however, formal meetings could result in delaying a
                        resolution of Article III.</p>
                    <p>3. US Ratification. He believes that we should give the Germans clear
                        assurances that the US would not ratify the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> if Euratom could not negotiate a satisfactory agreement with
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. (Euratom members fear that the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> might preclude our selling them
                        enriched uranium if they had not worked out an agreement with <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>.) So far, State and <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> have not wanted to go beyond stating we
                        would “take into account” the status of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>/Euratom negotiations as part of our ratification process.</p>
                    <p>4. US-Euratom Consultation. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> believes that we should accept the Dutch and Belgian
                        proposals to work out the language for Article III in a special meeting with
                        representatives of Euratom minus France—so far our negotiations have been
                        either bilateral or in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the current status of the consultations on Article III, we are
                        meeting on this problem with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on
                        Wednesday (Dec. 6). At that time, we should learn the position of the
                        Germans and the other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members on
                        language for Article III that we think will be acceptable to the Soviets. If
                        the Germans are willing to let us negotiate with the Soviets on this
                        language, there should be no problem with the other Euratom countries. If
                        they are not willing, I believe we will have to be ready for high-level
                        consultations with the Germans.</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> suggested yesterday that
                        the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Meeting next week<note n="5" xml:id="d221fn5">See <ref target="#d219fn4">footnote 4, Document

                        Ministers of Belgium, and Netherlands to resolve the Article III issue.
                        There is a question as to whether we should pursue this with Euratom or
                        bilaterally with Germany. In any event, Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> will be able to discuss the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> in his private talks with <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">“Dear Mr. Chancellor:</p>
                    <p>I was heartened by the warmth and hopefulness of your recent letter.</p>
                    <p>This has been an eventful year for each of us, both our nations, and the
                        international community our partnership serves. Our closeness of <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0578"/>mind and heart has given vital momentum to
                        the proposed Non-Proliferation Treaty. It is moving now in the direction we
                        desire. I share your hope that the Soviet Union may accept the concept of
                        verification of Euratom safeguards by <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>.
                        You can be certain that the United States will continue to press for that
                        with all vigor and persuasiveness.</p>
                    <p>The momentum of the European integration movement must be maintained. A free
                        flow, from country to country, of nuclear materials for peaceful uses is
                        crucial to Europe's progress. The Non-Proliferation Treaty must not hamper
                        such traffic between nations who enter into the treaty and carry out its
                        obligations in good faith.</p>
                    <p>We have consulted with our allies in the North Atlantic Council on further
                        action to obtain an effective safeguards article that also protects the
                        principle of verification. Our Geneva delegates are instructed to tell the
                        Soviet Co-Chairman of our firm belief that the road to agreement on Article
                        III is through the draft on November 2.<note n="3" xml:id="d222fn3">See <ref target="#d216">Document 216</ref>.</note> The Soviets, as you know,
                        have so far rejected this language. They claim it constitutes
                        self-inspection by Euratom members of Euratom members. This is not so. Every
                        effort will be made to reassure the Soviets of that.</p>
                    <p>We have emphasized to them the clear and basic intent of this article. The
                        agreement between <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and Euratom seeks
                        only to assure all Treaty parties that safeguards will be effective in
                        practice. It intends only that <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> can be
                        certain that nuclear material is not diverted to nuclear weapons or other
                        nuclear explosive devices. I am assured that these key principles are
                        consistent with the German position. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> is now en route to Brussels, and I have asked him to
                        review the entire matter of non-proliferation with your Foreign Minister.</p>
                    <p>Your own journeys to London and Asia have given me real and timely
                        encouragement. The British quest to join the Common Market is strengthened
                        by your support. My own hopes for peace in Asia are lifted by the promise
                        you found, and the example you left. I am no less grateful for your
                        government's recent policy statement on defense. These are initiatives all
                        the world can value. They speak eloquently and optimistically of your
                        personal commitment to a world at peace, and your people's determination to
                        advance that joyous day. Its coming is hastened by Germany's efforts to draw
                        her eastern neighbors closer in one community pledged to the betterment of
                        all. Americans are proud to share that vision with you.</p>
                    <p>For myself, it is a comfort to know the warmth of your friendship and the
                        strength of your partnership in these trying days. With freedom at test and
                        the future in hazard, it is good to recall the resolve we shared in <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0579"/>our Bonn and Washington meetings.
                        It will sustain me, and inspire all who work with us, in the new year that
                        approaches.</p>
                    <p>May it bring us the blessings of peace and freedom that we seek. Should it
                        also bring you back to my country, that too would be a blessing. Mrs.
                        Johnson and I look forward to the happiness of showing you more of America
                        and her people.</p>
                    <p>We speak for all of them in sending you and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> our kindest regards and best wishes.</p>

                    <p>1. Safeguards: Foster said that, as was the case with the procedure used to
                        find a solution for Articles I and II, we should deal with heart of the
                        matter as regards Art III and avoid complicating solution we both want by
                        attempting to use politically unacceptable labels. After exhaustive allied
                        consultations, US has concluded the road to solution lies through Nov 2
                            formulation.<note n="2" xml:id="d223fn2">See <ref target="#d216">Document 216</ref>.</note>

                        <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> wondered whether the
                        expression “road lies through Nov 2 formulation” meant that solution would
                        have to be based exactly on that formulation or something similar. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said US has now made clear its firm
                        view and he felt Sovs should be able to evaluate meaning of this expression.
                        Foster reiterated we need deal with reality of Euratom's existence, its
                        ownership of fuels, and its common facilities. Verification by <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> would have to avoid extremes of complete
                        duplication on one <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0580"/>hand or mere
                        paper check on the other. He was sure that arrangement resulting from
                        agreement to be concluded with <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> would
                        provide equal treatment for nonnuclear parties as regards safeguards to
                        guard against diversion of fissionable materials to weapons.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> felt situation complicated
                        by fact that US resting on Nov 2 formulation while Sov prefer Sept 2<note n="3" xml:id="d223fn3">The September 2 Soviet draft has not been further
                            identified.</note> and there is very little time left in which to bridge
                        the gap. He wondered if Foster had any ideas as to the direction in which
                        the US could move in order to help find a solution to Art III. Foster
                        repeated that the Nov 2 formulation was the only one which could be made

                        to this treaty and all other parties which, on the date the amendment is
                        circulated, are members of the Board of Governors of the International

                        he would report language to Moscow.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Duration</hi>: Foster expressed hope Moscow was
                        considering our proposal regarding duration.<note n="5" xml:id="d223fn5">See
                                <ref target="#d221">Document 221</ref>.</note> We believe such a
                        clause will help gain adherence of several key position nuclear powers. He
                        added that Sovs now had received all of our ideas concerning essential
                        elements for <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and were now in position to
                        look at treaty in terms of a final overall solution. <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> expressed concern over tendency to
                        reconsider understanding previously reached between US and Soviet Union and
                        felt this could lead to interminable discussion with no result. As regards
                        duration clause, he also wondered if US having suggested 25-year duration,
                        others would suggest various shorter periods.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> stressed US still prefers
                        unlimited duration but convinced that this matter required further
                        consideration by US and Soviet Union if <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0581"/>we are to obtain necessary signatories to treaty. It was
                        pointed out that clause suggested by US was not designed to limit treaty to
                        25 years, but on contrary to provide for extension of treaty after 25 years.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> added that if <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and US reach agreement on such clause,
                        they could stand fast against attempt to provide for shorter period.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Assurances</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> said that he was not clear as to the meaning of
                        proposed US clause on non-use of nuclear weapons (paras 6 and 7 state
                            74017).<note n="6" xml:id="d223fn6">Paragraphs 6 and 7 of telegram 74017

                            read: “6. New paragraph D for our draft UNSC Resolution: 'D. Welcomes
                            the intention expressed by nuclear-weapon states to refrain from the
                            threat or use of nuclear weapons against any non-nuclear-weapon state
                            that has undertaken not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear
                            weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, or control over such weapons
                            or devices, and that is not engaged in an armed attack assisted by a

                            18-6)</note> What was meant by the phrase “Not engaged in an armed
                        attack assisted by a nuclear-weapon state?” Would it mean in practice that
                        this assurance would not apply to members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw Pact? <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> replied that US and Sovs would have considerable freedom
                        in determining circumstances in which assurances would or would not apply.
                        He believed it was clear that if member of one of these alliances attacked
                        member of another, it would be presumed that it had the assistance of its
                        nuclear ally. In any event each nuclear power was free to make this
                        determination on the basis of its own judgment. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> gave the same reply when <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> asked if the same situation would obtain with
                        respect to a country like Spain or some other ally of US.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> then inquired whether the
                        declaration to be made on the subject of assurances would have to be similar
                        or whether there could be some difference. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said that they should be at least similar in order
                        not to detract from their value. Perhaps they need not be identical but two
                        governments should consult in advance and compare their proposed statements.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> took opportunity to remind

                        discuss problem of halting and limiting arms race in strategic nuclear

                        his delegation had no instructions on this matter but that he would report

                    </list>
                    <p>At my request Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> came
                        to my office today to discuss the situation with reference to the
                        reconvening of the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> on January 18.</p>
                    <p>I briefly recounted the proceedings at the last two or three meetings of the
                        Co-Chairmen in Geneva with which he appeared to be generally familiar. I
                        emphasized the necessity of our using the brief time between now and
                        mid-January in an attempt to find some way of making progress on the
                        remaining questions between us on the Non-Proliferation Treaty. As had
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName>, Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked for any
                        suggestions we might have as to changes in the first sentence of Article
                        III. I emphasized to him, as I had to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName>, that the November 2 formulation had been developed
                        after intensive consultations with our Allies and met the five principles
                        which Euratom had convinced our Allies were essential in order for the NPT
                        to be acceptable to them.<note n="2" xml:id="d224fn2">See <ref target="#d216">Document 216</ref> for the text of the November 2
                            draft and the relevant five Euratom principles.</note> Since it is most
                        important that these Allies do find the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                        acceptable in order for it to be of greatest value, it therefore appears
                        clear that we must find a way to proceed along the lines of the November 2
                        formulation and only through this method does such progress seem possible. I
                        briefly sketched the remaining open questions on duration, amendments, and
                        review conferences and the Ambassador stated he was aware of these points
                        but had no specific new information on them.</p>
                    <p>I reviewed the important timing questions starting with the necessity of the
                        Co-Chairmen meeting in Geneva about the 15th of January if the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> is to reconvene on January 18. The
                        meeting of the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> on the 18th would allow
                        approximately two months at Geneva in order to be able to meet the deadline
                        of the U.N. Resolution which in turn leaves little time for other
                        formalities prior to the scheduled meeting of the non-nuclear-weapon nation
                        states on August 29. The Ambassador agreed <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0583"/>with these concerns and felt that time indeed is running
                        out since any substantial delay, in his opinion, would lead to decisions
                        being made on the part of certain countries which would make it impossible
                        to achieve limits on proliferation.</p>
                    <p>I told him that the discussions between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> and Minister <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> in New York covering the possibility of Mexican and
                        other amendments being accepted and put before the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> on January 18 might allow a little more time for
                        discussions on Article III between the Co-Chairmen, but not much time. We
                        also discussed the possibility of a meeting of Foreign Ministers at Geneva
                        if sufficient progress had been made so that the completion of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> appeared close to achievement.</p>
                    <p>He said he would report our discussions to Moscow but hoped that we too would
                        consider the possibility of flexibility on the first sentence of Article
                        III, Paragraph 1.<note n="3" xml:id="d224fn3">For a discussion of the
                            negotiations over the first sentence of Article III, paragraph 1, see

                    </p>
                    <p>I made known to him that I expect to be out of circulation for a period due
                        to the probable necessity of an operation this week. He asked who would head
                        the delegation at Geneva, and I said either Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> or Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DPS2">De
                        Palma</persName>, at least at first.</p>
                    <p>In concluding, I mentioned again the deep interest that the United States
                        Government has in the possibility of discussions on the limitation of
                        offensive and defensive delivery systems. He responded that he was aware of
                        this, having recently heard the same thing from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.</p>

                    <p>There have been no speeches at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> by
                        the non-aligned since the new text was presented on January 18.<note n="2" xml:id="d225fn2">For <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>'s

                        will be no speeches at all at the next plenary on January 30. Two things
                        seem to account for this: lack of time to obtain considered reactions from

                        meeting in Delhi next week, which will take several prominent non-aligned
                        delegates to <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> away from Geneva
                        temporarily.</p>
                    <p>I believe the slow pace at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> in the
                        next few weeks has certain advantages for us. (1) It will give us an
                        opportunity to make special representations on behalf of the new draft in
                        the capitals of the Eight non-aligned members of the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>. (2) It will give us more time to work
                        out the security assurances problem with the Soviets before non-aligned
                        views start to jell in Geneva. (3) The non-aligned, and not we and the
                        Soviets this time, are under pressure to state their positions before the
                        March 15 deadline for a report to the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The non-aligned will wish to put some stamp on the treaty. It is recognition
                        of this which may have motivated the Soviets to refuse to agree to include a
                        provision on periodic review conferences in the January 18 draft. I believe
                        the Soviets will probably agree to such a provision but that they will not
                        agree to loosen up the duration clause further.</p>
                    <p>It thus seems to be in our interest to canalize non-aligned activities to
                        getting a periodic review provision into the treaty and perhaps also to
                        include the original Italian suggestion of relating the purposes of the
                        preamble to provision for review conferences. This would have the effect of
                        giving the non-nuclear countries periodic opportunities to assess what
                        progress is made on further arms control measures and thus help to <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0585"/>meet the argument that the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> is not sufficiently balanced with regard to
                        obligations of the nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states.</p>
                    <p>We are expecting a representation from the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> regarding “flexibility.” I think we should from the outset
                        discourage the Germans from expecting any change in the duration clause,
                        pointing out there seems to be a definite relationship between it and Soviet
                        acceptance of the November 2 formulation for Article III. However, I would
                        recommend telling the Germans that we shall seek to make the treaty more
                        flexible through pressing for a provision for periodic review. At the same
                        time I think we should avoid giving the Germans the impression that we shall
                        insist on changes in the January 18 draft, since in any event such changes
                        are unlikely to satisfy Strauss, who apparently is <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName>'s main problem with the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>1. In my memorandum to you of October 25, 1967 (Enclosure A), I recommended
                        that you inform President Diaz of Mexico that the United States intends to
                        sign Protocol II to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in
                        Latin America (Enclosure B).<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2">Enclosure B,
                            entitled “Text of LANFZ Treaty” is not attached. For text of Protocol
                            II, see 22 UST 754. The United States is not a signatory to the Treaty
                            for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (Treaty of Tlatelolco) which was
                            signed by 14 Latin American nations at Mexico City on February 14, 1967.
                            Vice President Humphrey signed Protocol II to this Treaty on behalf of
                            the United States at Mexico City on April 1, 1968.</note> This Treaty,
                        which has been signed by 21 Latin American countries and ratified by Mexico
                            <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0586"/>and Brazil, would prohibit
                        Latin American Parties from producing, testing, or possessing nuclear
                        weapons in their respective territories; it would also forbid the receipt or
                        installation of any nuclear weapons in such territories. In addition, Latin
                        American Parties to the Treaty would undertake to use nuclear material and
                        facilities under their jurisdiction exclusively for peaceful purposes. The
                        Treaty contains two protocols which are open for signature by the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>2. Protocol I calls for countries outside the Treaty zone to undertake the
                        obligations of the Treaty with respect to their territories within the zone.
                        US adherence to this Protocol would result, for example, in the
                        incorporation of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in the zone. On December
                        10, 1965, Bill Foster wrote the Chairman of the Negotiating Committee of the
                        Preparatory Commission for the Denuclearization of Latin America that:</p>
                    <p>“We do not wish to have included in the proposed nuclear free zone the Virgin
                        Islands, since it is United States territory, or the Commonwealth of Puerto
                        Rico, because of its integral relationship with the United States. In the
                        case of both of these areas, the United States must deal with disarmament
                        policies affecting other nuclear powers …”</p>
                    <p>3. Protocol II calls upon nuclear-weapon states to agree to respect the
                        obligations set forth in the Treaty and to promise not to use or threaten to
                        use nuclear weapons against Contracting Parties to the Treaty.</p>
                    <p>4. On October 26, 1967, you informed President <persName corresp="#p_DOG2">Diaz</persName>
                        <note n="3" xml:id="d226fn3">At the invitation of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, President Diaz of Mexico made
                            a State visit to the United States October 26-28. For text of the joint
                            communique issued by <persName corresp="#p_DOG2">Diaz</persName> and
                            Johnson on October 27 following private discussions, and for other
                            remarks issued by both during this visit, see <hi rend="italic">Public
                                Papers of the Presidents of the United States: Lyndon B.
                            Johnson</hi>, 1967, Book II, pp. 945-962.</note> that the United States
                        intends to sign Protocol II with an interpretive statement after
                        consultations with the Congress (Enclosure C). These consultations,
                        necessary because ratification of Protocol II will require the advice and
                        consent of the Senate, are now complete. Both the Joint Committee on Atomic
                        Energy and the Foreign Relations Committee have been briefed in executive
                        session on the Treaty and on our plan to sign Protocol II. Except for
                        Senator Curtis who questioned the reference to general and complete
                        disarmament in the preamble (a similar reference appears in the preamble of
                        the Limited Test Ban Treaty) no objections were raised. At Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName>'s request, a personal call was
                        made to Senator Hickenlooper who had been present at the Joint Committee but
                        not at the Foreign Relations meeting. Senator <persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName>, without committing himself, indicated that, on
                        balance, he would not object to signature of Protocol II with a statement of
                        interpretation, but that he thought ratification should depend on the degree
                        of acceptance of the statement of interpretation <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0587"/>by Latin American countries. In addition, Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEMK1">Dirksen</persName>, the members of the House Foreign
                        Affairs Committee, and the staff of the Preparedness Investigating
                        Subcommittee have been advised that we are giving sympathetic consideration
                        to signing Protocol II. No objections have been expressed.</p>
                    <p>5. As indicated in my memorandum to you of October 25 (Enclosure A), I
                        believe that, by adhering to Protocol II, the US would not only be
                        identified with a major arms control measure of special significance to our
                        hemisphere relations, but would also be in a better position to influence
                        the implementation of the Treaty in a manner favorable to our interests. The
                        interpretive statement (Enclosure D) which I would recommend to accompany
                        signature is designed to resolve five matters of concern to the United
                        States. The statement would: 1) make clear that ratification of Protocol II
                        would not constitute United States acceptance of the territorial claims of
                        Latin American Parties; 2) emphasize that the Treaty and its Protocols have
                        no effect upon our transit rights in Latin America; 3) explain our pledge in
                        Protocol II “not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against
                        Contracting Parties” so as to permit a nuclear response in the event of an
                        armed attack by a Latin American Contracting Party in which it is assisted
                        by a nuclear-weapon state; 4) reiterate the position of the United States
                        that this Treaty prohibits Contracting Parties from acquiring nuclear
                        explosive devices even if intended for peaceful purposes, but permits the
                        United States to carry out nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes for the
                        Contracting Parties; and 5) state that the United States would act in the
                        same manner with respect to the Latin American territories of Protocol I
                        adherents as it would with respect to the territories of the Contracting
                        Parties to the Treaty, thereby encouraging the Netherlands,<note n="4" xml:id="d226fn4">The Dutch have expressed concern to us that Protocol II
                            does not expressly apply to their Latin American territories. [Footnote
                            in the source text.]</note> France, and the United Kingdom<note n="5" xml:id="d226fn5">The United Kingdom signed Protocols I and II on
                            December 20, 1967. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> to ratify
                        Protocol I and providing additional evidence of our support for the proposes
                        of the Treaty at negligible cost. Our “interpretations” would not constitute
                        “reservations” which are prohibited by the Treaty and they would serve to
                        offset interpretations which differ from our own. (For example, the dominant
                        Latin American view, with which we concur, that Contracting Parties cannot
                        acquire nuclear explosive devices for peaceful purposes is not shared by
                        Brazil and Argentina.)</p>
                    <p>6. The Latin American countries are observing US actions on Protocol II
                        closely as an indication of our support for the Latin American Nuclear Free
                        Zone and arms control measures generally. An early public announcement,
                        prior to signature of the Protocol, would be highly desirable <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552" facs="0588"/>in order to encourage ratification of the
                        Treaty by additional Latin American nations and to obtain their support in
                        the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> negotiations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
                    <p>1. The United States should not sign Protocol I at this time because of
                        security requirements.</p>
                    <p>2. The United States should sign Protocol II as soon as possible,
                        accompanying signature with the interpretive statement set forth in
                        Enclosure D.</p>
                    <p>3. You should publicly announce at an early date that the United States is
                        prepared to sign Protocol II.</p>
                    <p>These recommendations are concurred in by the Director of the Arms Control
                        and Disarmament Agency, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Deputy Secretary of

                    <p rend="center">MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT</p>
                    <p>SUBJECT</p>
                    <p>Latin American Nuclear Free Zone Treaty</p>
                    <p>I believe the President of Mexico will ask you whether the United States is
                        prepared to sign Protocol II to the Latin American Nuclear Free Zone Treaty,
                        better known as the “Treaty of Tlatelolco.” I recommend that you tell him
                        that the United States intends to sign Protocol II.</p>
                    <p>Signing Protocol II with appropriate interpretative statements is in our view
                        the best way of protecting our transit rights in Latin America for ships and
                        aircraft with nuclear weapons. We believe that the most satisfactory method
                        of achieving an effective interpretation on transit rights is to accompany
                        our signature to Protocol II with an interpretative statement <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0589"/>which would be circulated routinely to all
                        signatories, including the 20 Latin American nations which have already
                        signed. We may also wish to inform certain Latin American Governments in
                        advance of the interpretative statements we would plan to make accompanying
                        our signature of Protocol II. We believe the negotiating history of the
                        Treaty makes it clear that our interpretation is the correct one, but we
                        want to do what we can to assure that this interpretation is not contested
                        by important Latin American Governments.</p>
                    <p>By signing Protocol II, we would agree first, to respect the status of
                        denuclearization of Latin America and second, not to use or threaten to use
                        nuclear weapons on the territory of Contracting Parties. The second
                        obligation would limit to some extent our flexibility of response with
                        nuclear weapons in Latin America. However, we do not believe this limitation
                        to be unreasonable in light of the agreement of the Contracting Parties not
                        to acquire nuclear weapons. With an interpretative statement, we believe the
                        United States' interests will be protected. The circumstances present in
                        Latin America are such as to justify a departure from our past policy
                        concerning limitations on our freedom of response with nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>There are three other questions which would be dealt with in an
                        interpretative statement to be made at the time of signature. These would be
                        designed to make clear our views on peaceful nuclear explosive devices, on
                        the territorial extent of our Protocol II obligations, and on a definition
                        of territory as it applies to sea and air space. An interpretative statement
                        is not being worked out within the Government and need not be discussed with
                        President <persName corresp="#p_DOG2">Diaz</persName> at this time.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations:</p>
                    <p>1. That, if asked by the President of Mexico, you might reply along the
                        following lines: “I congratulate you, Mr. President, on an achievement of
                        which your Government can be justly proud. This is the signature by 20 Latin
                        America governments of the first treaty establishing a nuclear free zone.
                        The American people join with me in saluting this unique achievement. We
                        hope this treaty will be a milestone toward world-wide agreement to a
                        non-proliferation treaty and further steps of disarmament. We have followed
                        your efforts with great expectation and have given careful thought and much
                        study to the treaty. We intend to provide you and the other Contracting
                        Parties with a statement of our understanding of the scope and effect of the
                        treaty, and on this basis we intend to sign Protocol II.”</p>
                    <p>2. That, if you are asked when the United States will sign, you might state:
                        “I am as anxious as you are to move forward on this important treaty as
                        promptly as possible.”</p>
                    <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0590"/>
                    <p>3. That, preferably, no public announcement be made of our intention to sign
                        Protocol II at this time since we are not yet actually ready to sign it. If
                        the subject of Protocol II is discussed privately, the communique should
                        read: “The two Presidents discussed the nuclear free zone treaty. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> congratulated President
                        Diaz on this outstanding example of Latin American statesmanship and stated
                        that we are giving our most sympathetic consideration to signing Protocol
                        II.”</p>
                    <p>4. That, if you are asked whether we will sign Protocol I, you might state:
                        “Our serious difficulties with Protocol I have already been made known to
                        your Government.” (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>—the United States
                        cannot sign Protocol I because to do so would require denuclearization of
                        our territories in Latin America, including Puerto Rico. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>)</p>
                    <p>These recommendations are concurred in by the Director of the Arms Control

                    <p rend="center">DRAFT STATEMENT TO ACCOMPANY SIGNATURE OF PROTOCOL II</p>
                    <p>“In signing Protocol II of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, the United States
                        Government wishes to make the following statement:</p>
                    <p rend="center">I</p>
                    <p>“The United States understands that the Treaty and its Protocols have no
                        effect upon the international status of territorial claims.</p>
                    <p>“The United States takes note of the Preparatory Commission's interpretation
                        of the Treaty, as set forth in the Final Act, that, governed by the
                        principles and rules of international law, each of the Contracting Parties
                        retains exclusive power and legal competence, unaffected by the terms of the
                        Treaty, to grant or deny non-Contracting Parties transit and transport
                        privileges.</p>
                    <p>“As regards the undertaking in Article 3 of Protocol II not to use or
                        threaten to use nuclear weapons against the Contracting Parties, the United
                        States would have to consider that an armed attack by a Contracting Party,
                        in which it was assisted by a nuclear-weapon State, would be incompatible
                        with the Contracting Party's corresponding obligations under Article 1 of
                        the Treaty.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II</p>
                    <p>“The United States wished to point out again the fact that the technology of
                        making nuclear explosive devices for peaceful purposes is indistinguishable
                        from the technology of making nuclear weapons and the fact that nuclear
                        weapons and nuclear explosive devices for peaceful purposes are both capable
                        of releasing nuclear energy in an uncontrolled manner and have the common
                        group of characteristics of large amounts of energy generated
                        instantaneously from a compact source. Therefore we understand the
                        definition contained in Article 5 as necessarily encompassing all nuclear
                        explosive devices. It is our understanding that Articles 1 and 5 restrict
                        accordingly the activities of the Contracting Parties under paragraph 1 of
                        Article 18.</p>
                    <p>“The United States further notes that paragraph 4 of Article 18 of the Treaty
                        permits, and that United States adherence to Protocol II will not <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0592"/>prevent, collaboration by the
                        United States with Contracting Parties for the purpose of carrying out
                        explosions of nuclear devices for peaceful purposes in a manner consistent
                        with our policy of not contributing to the proliferation of nuclear weapons
                        capabilities. In this connection, the United States reaffirms its
                        willingness to make available nuclear explosion services for peaceful
                        purposes on a non-discriminatory basis under appropriate international
                        arrangements and to join other nuclear-weapon states in a commitment to do
                        so.</p>
                    <p rend="center">III</p>
                    <p>“The United States also wishes to state that, although not required by
                        Protocol II, it will act with respect to such territories of Protocol I
                        adherents as are within the geographical area defined in Article 4, Section
                        2 of the Treaty in the same manner as Protocol II requires it to act with
                        respect to the territories of Contracting Parties.”</p>

                        simultaneous detonations. The initial <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>
                        request for this experiment and others was submitted on June 2, 1967, under

                            <ref target="#d197">Document 197</ref>. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> argued against the approval of Buggy I “on the ground
                        that it involves a very substantial risk of causing radioactive debris to be
                        present in Canada in amounts that will be detected, publicized, and used to
                        support charges that we have deliberately violated the Limited Test Ban
                        Treaty. Such charges would, among other consequences, have a decidedly
                        adverse impact on our efforts to secure acceptance of a non-proliferation

                        Non-Proliferation Treaty (<gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> reported that two weeks
                        previously the US and Soviet Union had jointly submitted to the

                        Security Council. The US, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had also agreed on essentially
                        identical declarations that they would each make in connection with the

                            Council, see ibid., pp. 156-158. On June 19, the Security Council
                            approved the resolution by a vote of 10 to 0, with 5 abstentions.
                            Canada, China, Denmark, Ethiopia, Hungary, Paraguay, Senegal, Soviet

                        constitute a new commitment for the United States but rather gave promise of
                        action by reaffirming our existing commitments <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0595"/>under the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. He
                        reported that the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> had now submitted to

                        192-193.</note> A Special Session of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> will begin sometime
                        between April 17 and 24. He noted that we still had problems and that India
                        and Brazil had indicated their reservations about the treaty. He stated that
                        we shared with the Soviet Union a desire to convey the feeling that the
                        present draft was the text of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and
                        not simply a proposal subject to general amendments. At the same time,
                        however, we did not wish to join the Soviet Union in an attempt to railroad
                        the treaty through the Special Session of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. He believed that it was important to give everyone an
                        opportunity to talk the issue out completely. If the treaty did not run into
                        serious problems in the Special Session, it could then be opened for
                        signature later this spring. He reported that Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> and Malik were working out the
                        tactics for the Special Session, and that we were working on India, Brazil,
                        the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, etc., through regular diplomatic
                        channels in an attempt to overcome their reservations. There is no question
                        that there would be an effort by some countries to delay action on the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> in the Special Session by attempting
                        to amend it, to return it to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> for
                        further consideration, or to defer it to the next session of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. He noted that if the Special Session
                        goes well, we sign, and the Senate approves, we will then have to decide, on
                        the basis of the existing situation, whether to ratify and deposit the
                        treaty immediately or to defer this action. He noted that, even if we have
                        problems in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, we could still open
                        the treaty for signature since there would in any case be very large support
                        for it.</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> then raised the question
                        as to what would happen after the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> since
                        it calls on the nuclear weapons states to negotiate “in good faith” toward
                        nuclear disarmament. He noted that we had already made several major
                        proposals—the comprehensive test ban; cut-off of production of nuclear
                        materials for weapons; and the freeze on offensive-defensive strategic
                        weapons systems. A new proposal is now being considered within the
                        Government concerning the control of the seabed. In this connection, the
                        Soviet Union the previous week had formally made a proposal to prohibit use
                        of the seabed for military purposes beyond the 12-mile limit.<note n="5" xml:id="d229fn5">Presumably a reference to the statement delivered on
                            March 20, 1968, by Soviet Representative Malik to the U.N. Ad Hoc
                            Committee to Study the Peaceful Uses of the Seabed and the Ocean Floor
                            Beyond the National Jurisdiction; see ibid., pp 194-196.</note> He
                        thought therefore that we should quickly develop a forthcoming position on
                        this issue. He noted that our policy was to support a comprehensive test ban
                        provided there was adequate on-site inspection and that we had a forthcoming
                        position on the nuclear <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0596"/>cut-off. As
                        for the freeze on offensive-defensive strategic systems, we were still
                        waiting for a Soviet response.</p>
                    <p>In response to the President's question as to his views on the status of the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> stated that he had nothing
                        specific to add except the thought that bad things happen quickly and good
                        things happen much more slowly. He thought that, while the prospects for the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> were favorable, there were still
                        many problems ahead.</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> stated that the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> would be the most momentous achievement for
                        peace since the Limited Test Ban Treaty.<note n="6" xml:id="d229fn6">See
                                <ref target="#d3">Document 3</ref>.</note> The President and Amb.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> deserve the most credit
                        for this accomplishment. The full significance and effect of the treaty had
                        not yet fully sunk in with the public. With regard to the scenario, he
                        stated that it now looked as though the Special Session would begin on April
                        24 although we had originally wanted to meet earlier. He would be conferring
                        with the Soviets on tactics during the next few days. In general, it
                        appeared we believed in a softer sell than the Soviets. There were clearly
                        problem spots such as Italy; however, he thought these problems could be
                        resolved. He thought the biggest problem would be the effort by opponents to
                        delay action on the treaty until after the caucus of the non-nuclear states
                        in August so that the debate could be resumed in the next session of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> next September. With regard to the
                        location of the signing, he favored independent signing in the three
                        capitals—Washington, London, and Moscow. With regard to follow-on measures,
                        he noted that the seabed problem was a very complex, sensitive subject. He
                        would propose to send it back to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>
                        for full debate to avoid any premature commitments in the Special Session of
                        the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. He stated that while he was not
                        as optimistic about the outcome of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                        as Amb. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, he thought it could
                        be accomplished but emphasized that this would require hard work. He
                        estimated that the Special Session would last about five weeks. If the
                        treaty were then opened for signature, there would still be time to permit
                        its submission to the Senate before adjournment.</p>
                    <p>The President asked what the status of the seabed proposal actually was.</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> replied that <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> was now circulating a specific proposal
                        at the working level and that a final version would shortly be sent to the
                        Committee of Principals.<note n="7" xml:id="d229fn7">See <ref target="#d233fn4">footnote 4, Document 233</ref>.</note> He agreed
                        that the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> was the right forum. He
                        observed that the introduction of this new proposal would take some of the
                        pressure off of us on the comprehensive test ban issue.</p>
                    <p>The President asked about India's position on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> replied that the measure
                        was now before the Indian Cabinet and had not yet been decided. In the end,
                        however, he believed <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0597"/>that India may
                        well sign. He noted that arrangements had been made for Dr. Jerome Wiesner
                        to meet in Geneva with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SVA2">Sarabhai</persName>,
                        head of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission, who has emerged as the
                        principal Indian opponent of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, in
                        order to try to persuade him to modify his views.</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> said he thought the
                        Indian problem would be more difficult than this and he had encountered
                        outright opposition from their representatives in New York.</p>
                    <p>The President asked what other countries presented problems.</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> replied that Italy had
                        been quite difficult. However, the Italian Parliament was definitely in
                        favor of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and it would be difficult
                        for the Italian government to oppose it. Brazil opposed the treaty on the
                        grounds that it wants to be able to develop independently nuclear explosives
                        for peaceful purposes in order to help its economy. He stated, however, that
                        such an exception would completely undermine the treaty since peaceful
                        nuclear explosives suitable for peaceful purposes were equivalent to the
                        most advanced nuclear weapons. He noted that Brazil's position might change
                        since some strong counterforces were developing there on this issue. With
                        regard to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, he was very hopeful that
                        they would support the treaty. He noted that in the course of the long
                        negotiations with our allies the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had
                        written half of the treaty.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed his pleasure with the success that had been achieved
                        so far on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and congratulated
                        Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> for their accomplishments. He then
                        adjourned the meeting.</p>

                        of such a reference at least until the negotiation of specific long term

                    <p>Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>:</p>
                    <p>As you are aware, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission recently received
                        statutory authorization, through an amendment to the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> Cooperation Act permitting the
                        transfer to Euratom of up to a maximum of 1,500 kilograms of plutonium (an
                        increase of 1,100 kilograms over the previous authorizations) and up to
                        215,000 kilograms of contained uranium 235 (an increase of 145,000
                        kilograms). In this letter, I would like to describe general
                            arrangements<note n="4" xml:id="d230fn4">The original text of the first
                            part of this sentence reads: “In this letter, I would like to delineate
                            the general conditions that we would consider applicable to the transfer
                            of this material.”</note> that we would consider applicable to the
                        transfer of this material. These conform to the proposals that I outlined to
                        you in our meeting in Washington on January 25.</p>
                    <p>With this new statutory authority, the Commission will be in a position to
                        transfer or to approve the transfer of additional quantities of plutonium
                        and uranium 235 to the Community within the newly authorized amounts.<note n="5" xml:id="d230fn5">The original text of this paragraph continues
                            with: “under the conditions set forth in this letter. The following
                            paragraphs summarize the general conditions which, in accordance with
                                <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> policy, will be applicable to
                            the transfer of the additional plutonium and enriched uranium to the
                            Community.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0599"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Plutonium</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Of the 1,000 additional kilograms of plutonium to be made available,
                        acquisitions from private operators in the U.S. would not exceed at any time
                        50 percent of the total plutonium which the Community has obtained or has
                        commitments to obtain from the United States. Further, no more than 75
                        percent of any one private operator's plutonium would be so made available
                        to the Community. The remainder of the plutonium to be supplied under the
                        new authorization would be obtained from the USAEC. The price for the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> material would be the Commission's
                        established price in effect at the date of delivery, which currently is $43
                        per gram of fissile isotopes in the form of plutonium nitrate.</p>
                    <p>2. The research and development work to be performed with the additional
                        1,000 kilograms would be covered by appropriate information exchange
                        arrangements under which the USAEC would obtain the information derived from
                        the use of the material.</p>
                    <p>3. Any transfer of such additional plutonium would, of course, be subject to
                        the provisions of our Additional Agreement for Cooperation, as amended.</p>
                    <p>We would appreciate receiving as soon as practicable your best estimates
                        concerning the quantities and quality of plutonium desired by the Community,
                        including a schedule of anticipated deliveries.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Enriched Uranium</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Insofar as the additional quantity of enriched uranium is concerned, it is
                        our understanding that your estimates for the next five years include the
                        entire additional 145,000 kilograms of U-235 that has been authorized. We
                        would appreciate receiving confirmation from you to this effect. Upon
                        receipt of such confirmation, we will consider 215,000 kilograms of <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 as the new ceiling quantity transferable
                        under our additional Agreement for Cooperation, and pursuant to the
                        necessary contracts.<note n="6" xml:id="d230fn6">The original text of the
                            latter part of this sentence reads: “Agreement for Cooperation, subject
                            to the various terms of the Agreement for Cooperation including the
                            conclusion of the necessary contracts.”</note> The five-year period
                        contemplated in Article I of the Additional Agreement would commence for the
                        additional quantity on the date of your written reply.</p>
                    <p>2. The supply of the uranium 235 would be in accordance with the current
                            <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> “net amount concept” which was the
                        basis used by <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> and the USAEC for
                        calculating the U-235 increase. A definition of the “net amount concept” is
                        appended to this letter.</p>
                    <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> normal mode of supplying the
                        enriched uranium to the Community for power reactor applications would be
                        through toll enrichment while comparable services are made available to
                        licensed <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0600"/>users in the U.S. The
                        Additional Agreement contains wording broad enough to encompass toll
                        enrichment. Accordingly, it would provide a basis for the performance of
                        such services in connection with projects within the scope of that
                        Agreement, including joint program projects to the extent that both parties
                        wish to employ toll enrichment. In conformance with its current policy,
                            <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> sales of the newly authorized
                        quantities of enriched uranium to Euratom would take place only on a single
                        transaction basis rather than through long-term contracts.</p>
                    <p>All of these terms regarding the availability of enriched uranium are fully
                        consistent with U.S. supply policies which have been discussed in public in
                        recent months.<note n="7" xml:id="d230fn7">The original text continues with
                            an additional paragraph which reads: “The transfer of the plutonium and
                            the enriched uranium referred to in this letter will be subject, of
                            course, to mutually satisfactory safeguard provisions in accordance with
                            the terms of the Additional Agreement for Cooperation.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>We look forward to receiving confirmation from you that the understandings
                        set forth in this letter are acceptable to the Community.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>On March 16, following a briefing which <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                        gave you, you instructed me to form a committee to examine the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> recommendations on controlling the
                        strategic arms race. This review has now been <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0601"/>completed by representatives of the Department, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>, and I wish to submit
                        for your consideration and approval the following proposals.</p>
                    <p>Though the working group was initially in substantial agreement on these
                        proposals, I understand that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> has certain reservations and will be submitting to you a
                        separate memorandum on the subject. However, the proposals set forth in this
                        memorandum have the full approval of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>. They will be presented simultaneously by
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>
                        to Secretary Clifford. If you and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> agree on them, they will be checked with the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> prior to submission to the President for
                        his approval.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Objectives</p>
                    <p>The main aim of the US in engaging the Soviets in negotiations on strategic
                        missiles would be to reach an agreement which would maintain a stable
                        US-Soviet strategic deterrent relationship, primarily by controlling the
                        number of offensive and defensive missile launchers. Even if unsuccessful in
                        this quest, the US would benefit indirectly from such talks. They would
                        promote a better understanding of the concerns each side has in the
                        developing missile race. Also, a new US-Soviet agreement to hold such talks,
                        if announced in the near future, would help secure support for the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> (see below).</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Initial Negotiating Position</p>
                    <p>The US should be prepared to submit a concrete initial negotiating position
                        to the Soviets even prior to their agreement to set a date for talks. Some
                        Soviet contacts have intimated that such a step would help the Soviet
                        Government (i.e., those favoring talks) to reach a positive decision on this
                        matter. It would be taken as an earnest of our intent and help remove doubts
                        that, in proposing talks, we were merely bent on an intelligence fishing
                        expedition.</p>
                    <p>The attached initial negotiating position (Tab A), drafted in the form of an
                        oral statement to be presented by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> in Moscow, is a revised version of the paper
                        submitted to you, the Secretary of Defense, and the Acting Director of
                            <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> in early March.<note n="2" xml:id="d231fn2">The paper sent to <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>, and

                        Government on an initial negotiating position, so as to provide a base for
                        further examination of the problem and to be prepared for talks should they

                    <p>As for timing the proposed initiative, both you and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> indicated in early March that the
                        time was not ripe for such a move. This may still be the case today.
                        However, new considerations have arisen. The President's initiative, and the
                        North Vietnamese response, on limiting bombing have cast a better
                        international climate in regard to the Vietnam War. Also, on March 14, the
                            <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> completed its work on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and submitted a draft treaty to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly for its consideration and
                        endorsement. Preliminary soundings indicate that General Assembly support
                        for the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> may be anything but
                        overwhelming. A number of non-nuclear weapons states have complained, among
                        other objections, that the nuclear powers have assumed no meaningful
                        obligation under the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> to move forward
                        with the business of disarmament.</p>
                    <p>In order to dispel this charge, as well as to hold out an added inducement to
                        the Soviets to agree to talks, it is recommended that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> deliver the proposed statement
                        under Tab A promptly after his return to Moscow (April 17) and that he
                        preface this statement with a message from the President to Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> (Tab B), arguing that it
                        would be advantageous to the cause of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> if the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were to
                        announce during the General Assembly session their agreement to commence on

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Negotiating Tactics</p>
                    <p>Once negotiations begin, we should pursue in parallel discussions of concrete
                        proposals and of principles, embodying the concept of an agreed limitation
                        on the strategic arms race. The latter dialogue would be helpful in
                        convincing the Soviets of the desirability of our proposal, as well as in
                        obtaining a clearer idea of Soviet thinking on this arms-disarmament
                        complex, which in turn might influence our final negotiating position. The
                        general principles contained in the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                        briefing paper of March 16 could serve as guidelines for such a discussion.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Negotiating Problems and Alternatives</p>
                    <p>It is recognized that our initial negotiation position contains a number of
                        significant omissions and almost certainly would be challenged by the
                        Soviets on certain points. Several of them were examined in the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> study. In some problem areas, it would be
                        relatively easy to construct convincing rebuttals. In other cases, we might
                        at some point want to reconsider our position. However, I do not recommend
                        that decisions on these problem issues be made at this point. This would
                        have to be done after negotiations have been in progress for some time and
                        we have a clearer idea of Soviet intentions.</p>
                    <p>I understand that <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/P, at your instruction, is
                        preparing a separate study on the problem of strategic arms control and that
                        it proposes a rather substantial reduction of missiles. This study will be
                        given careful consideration and may prove useful for future contingencies.
                        However, I believe that, at this stage at least, our aim should be to obtain
                        Soviet agreement to level off the strategic arms race.</p>

                        for early talks on strategic missile controls. You should outline our views
                        on possible strategic missile controls and on desirability of early talks,

                        with Soviets.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Begin Text</hi>: The United States Government initially
                        proposed discussion on strategic anti-ballistic missile systems because of
                        our belief that deployment of such systems, even if justified in military
                        terms, could not help but spur on a new and costly cycle of the strategic
                        nuclear arms race. We agreed, however, in the very first exchange of views
                        with the Soviet Government's suggestion that such discussions should include
                        offensive strategic nuclear missile delivery systems, as well as
                        anti-missile defensive systems. This has remained throughout, and continues
                        to be, the position of the United States Government.</p>
                    <p>3. The United States Government has proposed these talks within the framework
                        of the Agreed Principles of September 20, 1961,<note n="8" xml:id="d231fn8">For text of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. joint statement of Agreed Principles for
                            Disarmament Negotiations, transmitted to the 16th Session of the U.N.
                            General Assembly, September 20, 1961, see <hi rend="italic">American
                                Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1961</hi>, pp. 1091-1094.</note>
                        accepted by our two Governments as a basis for disarmament negotiations and
                        as offering the best means to begin to make progress towards general and
                        complete disarmament. As we have noted earlier, we believe that it should be
                        possible to reach agreement more quickly on important limited measures
                        curbing the strategic arms race, without waiting for agreement on all of the
                        difficult problems inevitably involved in a program for general and complete
                        disarmament. We believe that measures to curb the strategic arms race would
                        help pave the way for substantial reductions, and would have great value in
                        themselves inasmuch as they would avoid a further costly and possibly
                        dangerous spiral of strategic missile deployments. The first step in
                        achieving meaningful strategic arms control should be to restrain the
                        further growth of strategic forces. It may not <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0605"/>prove easy to find mutually acceptable limitations, but we
                        are prepared to work earnestly toward that end, and we assume what you will
                        as well.</p>
                    <p>4. It should be possible for our two countries alone to agree on steps to
                        curtail the strategic arms race, and even to make reductions in existing
                        forces, without the necessary participation of others. Moreover, early
                        agreement between our two countries would be of great value in increasing
                        the likelihood that other countries would sign and continue to adhere to the
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty. We will be demonstrating that we are moving toward
                        disarmament as we are committed by the treaty to try to do.</p>
                    <p>5. Over a year has passed since we first proposed these discussions. Not only
                        is delay regrettable, but the problem which we are facing can become more
                        difficult with time. However, our task is to take account of the existing
                        situation in devising mutually acceptable measures to curtail the strategic
                        arms race. As each month goes by, the existing situation is one of greater
                        and more complex armaments on both sides. An agreement a year ago, when the
                        United States first proposed talks, might have prevented many of the
                        increases on both sides which are now in process. An agreement today to
                        curtail future deployments would have the same effect as an agreement a year
                        from now to effect a reduction in deployed weapons; it should also be easier
                        to negotiate, and would result in important savings of resources for us
                        both.</p>
                    <p>6. We recognize that limiting strategic arms consistent with our mutual
                        interests and common goals is a complex task, given the nature of
                        contemporary strategic offensive and defensive missile systems and the many
                        factors affecting and determining military capabilities. Our two nations
                        have different levels and kinds of strategic weapons systems and we may not
                        necessarily share identical evaluations regarding the utility and roles of
                        these systems. However, we believe that equitable and mutually beneficial
                        strategic arms limitations can be attained provided we start with a common
                        understanding of a problem and are striving for similar goals. In this
                        context, we believe that there are some basic principles underlying the
                        early achievement of any such mutually beneficial restraints on the
                        strategic arms race.</p>
                    <p>7. Any strategic arms limitation must provide balanced strategic postures
                        acceptable to both sides and should include both offensive and defensive
                        weapons systems. Both sides should be confident of a reasonable
                        second-strike deterrent force. These two related fundamental principles
                        should provide an acceptable strategic relationship on which to base
                        strategic arms control agreements. It would be futile for us to attempt to
                        define such concepts as “superiority” or “parity”, these notions have little
                        meaning in a situation, such as the present, in which each of us is certain
                        that the other has the capability under any circumstances to inflict
                        unacceptable damage. We recognize that some adjustments <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0606"/>in the deployment of the strategic forces
                        of each side might be appropriate. Such adjustments would be designed to
                        meet our common objective of providing assurance to both sides that their
                        security will be maintained or enhanced, while at the same time avoiding
                        possible disruptive effects and the great cost of a continuation of the
                        strategic arms race.</p>
                    <p>8. Our respective national means of verification should be adequate for
                        achieving meaningful strategic arms control constraints. The United States
                        is prepared to consider the possibilities of placing maximum reliance on
                        such verification of limitations on deployment of strategic offensive and
                        defensive weapons systems. For other more comprehensive measures, some
                        supplementary inspection arrangements may be required; we would be prepared
                        to include the minimum inspection necessary for effective verification. Our
                        position on this subject is flexible and is governed by the principles that
                        verification of compliance with agreed undertakings is necessary, that
                        maximum reliance should be placed on unilateral ability to verify
                        compliance, and that when additional procedures are required for adequate
                        verification, they must, of course, be provided.</p>
                    <p>9. With all of the above considerations in mind, the United States suggests
                        that consideration be given to cessation of the initiation of construction
                        of any additional strategic offensive missile launchers. This weapon
                        category should include strategic missiles of medium and intermediate range
                        (ranges greater than 1,000 KM), as well as longer-range intercontinental
                        missiles. If the agreement were to be limited to fixed land-based missile
                        systems, we would be prepared to rely exclusively on national means of
                        verification. In view of the difficulty of verifying through national means
                        the deployment of sea-based or mobile land-based strategic missile
                        launchers, the possibility of an agreed limitation applying to these weapons
                        could be the subject of discussion.</p>
                    <p>10. The situation with respect to strategic defensive anti-missile systems is
                        more complex. While some <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems may be
                        required in light of the offensive strategic missile systems of other
                        countries, we must recognize that as far as our own two countries are
                        concerned they may also be an important factor in the strategic balance
                        between us. This importance will, of course, be increased if there are
                        agreed limitations on offensive missile systems. In general, it would seem
                        that the most feasible limitation on strategic anti-missile defensive
                        systems would be an agreed number of anti-missile launchers and associated
                        radars which each side could deploy. As in the case of strategic offensive
                        missile systems, we believe that national means of verification would
                        provide assurance with respect to the scale of deployment of fixed
                        land-based defensive anti-ballistic missile launchers and associated radars.
                        Concerning land-mobile or sea-based anti-ballistic missile systems, the same
                            <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0607"/>considerations would prevail as
                        are noted above in regard to mobile offensive systems.</p>
                    <p>11. The United States Government has presented these views in the expectation
                        that representatives of our two Governments will meet shortly to discuss
                        these matters.</p>

                    <p>Action: AmEmbassy Moscow. Subject: Strategic Missile Talks.</p>
                    <p>1. You should deliver without delay the following personal message from
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Begin Text</hi>:</p>
                    <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> has informed me of
                        the talk he had with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on March 26. Concerning the proposal for our two
                        governments to hold discussions with the aim of controlling the strategic
                        arms race, I understand Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to say that the Soviet Government is still studying the
                        problem and that it attaches great importance to it.</p>
                    <p>I am gratified with the latter statement because it corresponds to my deep
                        conviction about the need for such negotiations. I am concerned, however,
                        about the necessity to initiate meaningful discussion as soon as possible.
                        As the United States Government has noted in previous communications, each
                        passing month increases the difficulty of reaching agreement on this matter
                        as, from a technical and military point of view, it is becoming more
                        complex. But there is an additional consideration, which leads me to write
                        you this letter.</p>
                    <p>As you are aware, the United Nations General Assembly has begun its
                        deliberations on the draft Non-Proliferation Treaty. This draft represents
                        the joint product of the efforts of our two governments. I am confident that
                        you share my earnest hope that it will obtain the maximum number of
                        adherents. During the resumed <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> session our
                        efforts to achieve a treaty that can be opened for signature in the near
                        future with the prospect of obtaining a maximum number of adherents will
                        face a most critical test. Efforts undoubtedly will be made by some states
                        to <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0608"/>postpone the opening of the
                        treaty for signature at least until after the conference of
                        non-nuclear-weapon states has been held in the fall of this year. It is
                        important that our two governments do everything possible to give the
                        greatest impetus to world sentiment favorable to opening the treaty for
                        signature at an early date.</p>
                    <p>To this end, I propose that our two governments announce early in the course
                        of the General Assembly debate that they have agreed to commence bilateral
                        negotiations on an agreement to limit strategic offensive and defensive
                        missiles within a specific time from the date of the announcement. I am
                        convinced that such a declaration, of primary importance in itself, would do
                        much to ensure the successful completion of work on the Non-Proliferation
                        Treaty.</p>
                    <p>Through these private bilateral discussions it should be possible for our two
                        countries to reach some agreement on initial steps for curtailing the
                        strategic arms race. We believe that equitable and mutually beneficial
                        strategic arms limitations can be attained provided we can reach a common
                        understanding of the problem and are striving for similar goals. In our
                        view, any strategic arms limitation must provide balanced strategic postures
                        acceptable to both sides and should include both offensive and defensive
                        weapons systems. Both sides should be confident of a reasonable
                        second-strike deterrent force. These two related fundamental principles
                        should provide an acceptable strategic relationship on which to base
                        strategic arms control agreements. We continue to believe that meaningful
                        strategic arms control constraints involving limitations on the deployment
                        of certain strategic offensive and defensive weapons systems can be
                        adequately verified by relying on our respective national capabilities.
                        Progress on controlling the strategic arms race, while important in itself,
                        will also contribute to our mutual objective of achieving and maintaining
                        the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
                    <p>I hope and trust that these actions will bring our two governments into
                        closer working relationships.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>Before you go to The Hague for the Nuclear Planning Group meeting on April
                        18-19, I believe you should be familiar with the US interpretations of
                        Articles I and II of the Non-Proliferation Treaty regarding alliance
                        arrangements for nuclear defense. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        has requested in particular that we make it clear that the realization of
                        the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> will not affect the work of the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The language of Articles I and II of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                        was chosen in order to protect alliance consultations on nuclear defense as
                        well as on nuclear defense deployment arrangements. These are not explicitly
                        sanctioned by Articles I and II, since the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was not prepared to provide such an endorsement of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> arrangements.</p>
                    <p>In Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s October 10, 1966
                        talk with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d232fn2">On October 10, 1966,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at a working dinner at the
                            Department of State to discuss the status of the Non-Proliferation
                            Treaty; see <ref target="#d158">Document 158</ref>.</note> it was
                        clearly understood that Articles I and II of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> deal only with what is prohibited and not what is permitted.
                        Article I of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> prohibits the transfer
                        of ownership or control of nuclear weapons (understood to mean warheads and
                        bombs and not delivery vehicles). It does not mention alliance consultations
                        or deployment arrangements not involving a transfer of nuclear weapons. We
                        worked out interpretations on these and other aspects of Articles I and II
                        with our allies (and in particular the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>)
                        which were presented to the Soviets on April 28, 1967 in the form of answers
                        to questions posed by our allies (Tab A).</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> agreed with us that it would not be
                        desirable to request comments from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        on these interpretations, since the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        could not be expected to be bound by unilateral interpretations or a treaty
                        made by others. However, the Soviets were informed that if they took an
                        official position in opposition to these interpretations, a very serious
                        problem would arise. The Soviets also were told that we expected that during
                        ratification hearings the US Senators would ask similar questions <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0610"/>as allied governments, and we
                        expected to make the same responses on our understanding of Articles I and
                        II.</p>
                    <p>We have not heard from the Soviets any indication that they will contradict
                        the US interpretations when they are made public in the process of
                        consideration of the treaty either by the US or by our allies. This does not
                        mean that they will necessarily agree with them.</p>
                    <p>We do not believe it would be in our interest or that of our allies to have a
                        public discussion of the US interpretations prior to the time when the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> is submitted to the Senate for
                        advice and consent.</p>
                    <p>On March 13 the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Embassy here requested
                        that a statement be made by you at The Hague <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss> meeting and also at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        Defense Ministers Meeting in May to the effect that the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> will not hinder the work of the <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss> or further nuclear defense arrangements
                        within the alliance compatible with Articles I and II of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. (Memcon and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> working paper attached as Tab B.)</p>
                    <p>We think it would be useful for you to make such a statement on both
                        occasions suggested by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and see no
                        objection to using substantially the language proposed by the Germans.</p>
                    <p>We have slightly rephrased the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> language
                        (Tab C). I suggest that you include such a statement in your presentations
                        both to the April 18-19 <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss> Meeting and at
                        the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Defense Ministers Meeting in May.</p>

                        ALLIES TOGETHER WITH ANSWERS GIVEN BY THE UNITED STATES</p>
                    <p>1. Q. What may and what may not be transferred under the draft treaty?</p>
                    <p>A. The treaty deals only with what is prohibited, not with what is permitted.</p>
                    <p>It prohibits transfer to any recipient whatsoever of “nuclear weapons” or
                        control over them, meaning bombs and warheads. It also prohibits the
                        transfer of other nuclear explosive devices because a nuclear explosive
                        device intended for peaceful purposes can be used as a weapon or can be
                        easily adapted for such use.</p>
                    <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0611"/>
                    <p>It does not deal with, and therefore does not prohibit, transfer of nuclear
                        delivery vehicles or delivery systems, or control over them to any
                        recipient, so long as such transfer does not involve bombs or warheads.</p>
                    <p>2. Q. Does the draft treaty prohibit consultations and planning on nuclear
                        defense among <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members?</p>
                    <p>A. It does not deal with allied consultations and planning on nuclear defense
                        so long as no transfer of nuclear weapons or control over them results.</p>
                    <p>3. Q. Does the draft treaty prohibit arrangements for the deployment of
                        nuclear weapons owned and controlled by the United States within the
                        territory of non-nuclear <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members?</p>
                    <p>A. It does not deal with arrangements for deployment of nuclear weapons
                        within allied territory as these do not involve any transfer of nuclear
                        weapons or control over them unless and until a decision were made to go to
                        war, at which time the treaty would no longer be controlling.</p>
                    <p>4. Q. Would the draft prohibit the unification of Europe if a nuclear-weapon
                        state was one of the constituent states?</p>
                    <p>A. It does not deal with the problem of European unity, and would not bar
                        succession by a new federated European state to the nuclear status of one of
                        its former components. A new federated European state would have to control
                        all of its external security functions including defense and all foreign
                        policy matters relating to external security, but would not have to be so
                        centralized as to assume all governmental functions. While not dealing with
                        succession by such a federated state, the treaty would bar transfer of
                        nuclear weapons (including ownership) or control over them to any recipient,
                        including a multilateral entity.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Minister von Lilienfeld said he called on instructions of his Government to
                        express German concern as to possible effects on the work of the <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss> of the Soviet exploitation of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. He gave Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> the attached paper containing talking points which he
                        described as a “non-paper” having no official status. He recalled that the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss> was closely connected with the
                        earlier <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> to which the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had attached importance. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> also attaches a great deal of importance to
                        the work of the <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss> both from the standpoint
                        of defense policy and from the psychological point of view.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>, referring to the talking
                        points, asked the Minister whether he considered our participation in the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss> had had a restrictive effect.
                        Minister von Lilienfeld said there is a feeling in German circles,
                        especially in military circles, that the US is resisting the sharing of
                        knowledge and decision-making in the nuclear field.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> pointed out to the Minister
                        that the <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss> was established to meet the
                        problem to which the Minister referred and that he thought it was doing good
                        work. He was not aware of any basis for the reported German concern that our
                        participation has had a restrictive effect. As to the desire expressed by
                        the Minister that the Secretary of Defense make statements at the <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss> Ministerial meeting on April 18 and at the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministers' meeting in May, we
                        would look into the matter. He said we certainly will not talk to the
                        Soviets about the <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss>. The situation is
                        clear on that score.</p>
                    <p>The Minister explained that it was not the desire of his Government that the
                        Secretary of Defense make formal declarations. The German Government had in
                        mind that the Secretary would include in his <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0613"/>remarks at these meetings statements along the lines set
                        forth in his talking paper.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Talking Paper</p>
                    <p>I have instructions to raise the question of the possible repercussions which
                        the non-proliferation treaty might have on the nuclear arrangements within
                        the Alliance. We raise this question particularly with respect to the
                        ministerial meeting of the Nuclear Planning Group schedule in the Hague on
                        April 18 and 19.</p>
                    <p>The interpretations which the US delegate in Geneva handed the Soviet
                        Co-Chairman on April 28, 1967 deal with this problem. These interpretations
                        had been the subject of consultations within the Alliance and also
                        bilaterally between the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
                    <p>The interpretations safeguard the nuclear arrangements as they presently
                        exist within the Alliance. We consider it desirable, however, that the US
                        Government make it clear vis-a-vis its allies that the Non-Proliferation
                        Treaty shall not impair the future work of the Nuclear Planning Group nor
                        the further development by the Nuclear Planning Group of nuclear
                        arrangements already existing. We are motivated by the fact that the Soviets
                        have time and again criticized the already existing nuclear arrangements
                        within the Alliance. We, therefore, have reason to expect that—by referring
                        to the Non-Proliferation Treaty—they will attempt to block any further
                        development of such arrangements, especially in the framework of the Nuclear
                        Planning Group.</p>
                    <p>Although the legal validity of such attempts were to be doubted, they could
                        produce a dangerous political impact, thus hindering the future work in the
                        Nuclear Planning Group and jeopardizing concrete improvements in the field
                        of consultation on nuclear matters.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that the Nuclear Planning Group already has produced some good
                        results and has done important preliminary work for an improvement of
                        nuclear consultation within the Alliance. But we <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0614"/>share the opinion of other members of the Alliance that
                        there is still a long way to go before satisfactory and final arrangements
                        of the problems the Nuclear Planning Group is dealing with are reached. Work
                        within the Nuclear Planning Group proceeds slowly and sometimes there is the
                        impression that a certain restrictive tendency impedes faster progress. As
                        far as we know, Secretary General Brosio occasionally has expressed similar
                        concerns on this matter.</p>
                    <p>All these reasons make it even more urgent that the US Government gives the
                        clarification we request. We feel, however, that this should not be done
                        through interpretations to be handed to the Soviets. We, too, would consider
                        it prejudicial if hereby a discussion about the Nuclear Planning Group would
                        be initiated with the Soviets. We would appreciate it if the Secretary of
                        Defense at the ministerial meeting at the Hague on April 18 and at the
                        Conference of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Defense Ministers in
                        May 1968 could make such a statement.</p>
                    <p>In our view it would be desirable if such a statement would state</p>
                    <p>—that the signing of the Non-Proliferation Treaty shall not interfere with
                        the determination of the US Government to further actively the work of the
                        Nuclear Planning Group and to cooperate in the aim of finding a solution
                        satisfactory to the non-nuclear partners of the Alliance for the formulation
                        and execution of nuclear planning within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>;</p>
                    <p>—that the Non-Proliferation Treaty shall not hinder the further development
                        of nuclear defense arrangements within the Alliance compatible with Articles
                        I and II of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>Last December, the U.N. General Assembly established an Ad Hoc Committee to
                        consider future uses of the seabed and ocean floor.<note n="2" xml:id="d233fn2">On December 18, 1967, the U.N. General Assembly
                            established a 35-member Ad Hoc Committee to Study the Peaceful Uses of
                            the Seabed and the Ocean Floor Beyond the Limits of National
                            Jurisdiction. The Ad Hoc Committee held three sessions in 1968. The
                            first two were held at U.N. headquarters in New York; the first March
                            18-27, and the second June 17-July 9. The third was held in Rio de
                            Janeiro, August 19-30. </note> During the recent meetings of this
                        Committee, there was widespread interest in applying arms control measures
                        to the seabed. The kinds of measures which were mentioned fall into the
                        following three categories:</p>
                    <p>a) Demilitarization of the seabed.</p>
                    <p>b) Reservation of the seabed for peaceful purposes.</p>
                    <p>c) Prohibiting the stationing of nuclear and other weapons of mass
                        destruction on the seabed.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of our studies of the desirability and feasibility of an arms
                        control measure, and as a result of staff-level discussions with other
                        agencies, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> has concluded that the
                        proposal for demilitarization of the seabed would be inimical to U.S.
                        national security because of its effect on critical U.S. underwater
                        surveillance systems. The reservation of the seabed for peaceful purposes
                        would require careful definition of the meaning of such a reservation in
                        order not to preclude the use of such surveillance systems. Further study is
                        required before the U.S. position on a peaceful purposes proposal can be
                        determined. Since a proposal to reserve the seabed for peaceful purposes
                        only can be expected to attract wide support, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> believes that its implications should be explored on an urgent
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>I do believe that the U.S. should urgently adopt a policy in favor of
                        negotiating a treaty to prohibit the stationing of nuclear or other weapons
                        of mass destruction on the seabed. I believe that such an arms control
                        measure would be in the U.S. interest. Taking such a position will enable us
                        to fend off more general proposals that might adversely affect our security
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that in the period following the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, the U.S. will be under considerable pressure to
                        demonstrate that it is prepared to <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0616"/>negotiate further arms control measures as required by Article VI of the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. A seabed arms control proposal
                        appears to be the most readily acceptable measure for multilateral
                        negotiation in light of the Soviet announcement of March 20 at the U.N. that
                        they favor discussing it in detail at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d233fn3">For a summary of the

                        beneath, or to the seabed beyond 12 nautical miles from its coast and up to

                        activities as well as nuclear weapons from the seabeds beyond the boundaries
                        of national jurisdiction.<note n="2" xml:id="d234fn2">Specific reference to

                            however, Malik addressed the same U.N. Committee on March 20 and
                            delivered a statement advocating such a proposal. For a summary of his
                            March 20 statement, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament,
                            1968</hi>, pp. 194-196.</note> In appraising this Soviet initiative, the
                        US Ambassador to the United Nations indicated that the proposal is certain
                        to have a prominent place on the forthcoming agenda of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Ad Hoc Committee. He predicted that the
                        Soviet proposal will receive broad support from nonnuclear states and asked
                        the Secretary of State for an urgent determination as to what the United
                        States would lose by agreeing to ban the emplacement of nuclear weapons on
                        the ocean bottoms, provided effective control methods could be worked out.
                        He stated that a negative US stance could have highly unfortunate effects on
                        deliberations concerning the nonproliferation treaty.<note n="3" xml:id="d234fn3">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s statement in response to the Soviet initiative

                    <p>2. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff agree with the
                        US Ambassador to the United Nations that the United States should prepare an
                        effective counter to the Soviet proposal.<note n="4" xml:id="d234fn4">Presumably a reference to the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                            proposal cited in <ref target="#d233fn4">footnote 4, Document
                        233</ref>.</note> Whatever the Soviet motive—which might well be entirely
                        political—international acceptance of their resolution would have grave
                        consequences for US national security interests. A demilitarization
                        agreement according to the Soviet format could easily entail an
                        interpretation making the US Sound Surveillance System (<gloss target="#t_SOSUS1">SOSUS</gloss>) illegal, with consequent severe impact
                        on our antisubmarine warfare capability. The Soviet proposal could also
                        prevent the development and/or deployment of future military systems which
                        may be required for US national defense.</p>
                    <p>3. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Another consideration is that an
                        agreement to demilitarize the seabeds could, by implication, lead to
                        international pressure to extend controls and prohibitions to the surface
                        and subsurface of the oceans.</p>
                    <p>4. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff, while
                        noting the opinion of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> that acceptance of a denuclearization proposal might
                        serve the immediate political purpose of helping to develop a climate of
                        opinion favorable to the nonproliferation treaty, believe that the
                        long-range consequences of banning the emplacement of nuclear weapons on the
                        seabeds would be detrimental to the security of the United States. If, in
                        the future, the US nuclear capability were to depend in part on the
                        emplacement of weapons and devices on the ocean bottoms, our option for
                        their use would be politically foreclosed by the terms of this proposed
                        agreement. While it is premature to decide whether the United States <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0618"/>should emplace weapons on the
                        seabeds in order to maintain the necessary strategic nuclear capacity in the
                        future, the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that such a requirement is a
                        distinct possibility. As new technological or political factors are
                        introduced into the strategic posture of nuclear weapons nations, new
                        concepts are being explored to meet the changing threat. It is the opinion
                        of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that it is not a question of current programs
                        but the risks to future US strategic nuclear programs that must be the
                        primary consideration in appraising a seabed denuclearization proposal.</p>
                    <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Possible future risks to the US
                        nuclear forces include enhanced effects of nuclear weapons, such as X-rays
                        and electromagnetic pulse, on US strategic missile systems. Another risk can
                        be identified in terms of the advancing technology in long-range underwater
                        surveillance systems. Therefore, there is a reasonable possibility that
                        scientific or technological breakthroughs could make US strategic offensive
                        and defensive missile systems vulnerable to enemy attack. To avoid this
                        eventuality, the United States might well be required to expand its nuclear
                        weapons deployment base to the seabeds. In this context, an arms control
                        agreement which would restrain the United States would be detrimental to US
                        security.</p>
                    <p>6. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) If “pindown” and submarine
                        vulnerability were to become a reality, the geographical features of the
                        United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would become of
                        great importance. The fact that the Soviet Union has a land area over twice
                        that of the United States would give it an obvious land-deployment advantage
                        over the United States. However, the United States has a conveniently
                        located territorial base for the effective use and control of a wide range
                        of deep seabed areas in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, whereas Soviet
                        access to the deep oceans is relatively restricted and environmentally
                        difficult. Its coastal control of sea bottom nuclear sites and its range or
                        site deployment would be significantly inferior to that of the United
                        States. Clearly, it would be advantageous to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> if it could offset these geographical handicaps with an
                        international arms control measure.</p>
                    <p>7. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff do not oppose
                        the consideration of arms control measures, including those affecting the
                        ocean environment, if an effective control system is established and
                        provided such measures will not have the effect of weakening the relative
                        strategic posture of the United States. The United States does not have a
                        verification capability now, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not believe
                        that any nation has now or will obtain such a capability in the foreseeable
                        future. In the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, an effective control
                        system for either a seabed “demilitarization” or a seabed “denuclearization”
                        agreement could not be developed satisfactorily. In sharp contrast, the
                        United States, the Soviet Union, and other nations have the present
                        technology to emplace <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0619"/>weapons of
                        mass destruction and other military devices on the ocean bottoms with
                        virtually no risk of detection. For example, the United States has been able
                        to plant extensive <gloss target="#t_SOSUS1">SOSUS</gloss> networks from
                        surface ships, despite difficulties in avoiding and deceiving Soviet
                        surveillance ships. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that no
                        demilitarization (including denuclearization) agreement could be verified
                        effectively.</p>
                    <p>8. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that
                        the establishment of a Johnson specialized agency to encourage international
                        cooperation in oceanography is in US interests. It is their opinion that
                        discussion and/or negotiations concerning the undersea environment should be
                        limited at this time to such matters as scientific research, exploration and
                        exploitation of resources, and establishment of marine parks and preserves.
                        Although future marine research and exploration may well indicate that there
                        are arms control measures which, if verifiable, would be in the national
                        interest, US support for arms control measures on the seabeds or in the
                        ocean space would not be in the national interest at this time and, in fact,
                        would bear a potential for grave harm.</p>
                    <p>9. (<gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that
                        their views on arms control in the seabed be forwarded to the President.</p>

                        in countering the anticipated basic complaint that the Soviet Union and the

                        principles on which we would be prepared to negotiate, the message presents
                        a specific new proposal for consideration (paras. 9 and 10). Specifically,
                        we would propose a cessation of the initiation of construction of any
                        additional strategic offensive missile launchers. Moreover, if this
                        agreement were limited to land-based missiles, we would be prepared to rely
                        exclusively on national means of verification. We would also propose to
                        limit strategic anti-missile defense systems to an agreed number of
                        launchers and associated radars. This would also be monitored by national
                        means of verification in the case of fixed land-based systems. We would also
                        be prepared to discuss the problem of monitoring more extensive

                        national interest at this time and, in fact, would bear a potential for
                        grave harm.<note n="3" xml:id="d236fn3">See <ref target="#d234">Document

                        proposes a treaty in which “each state party to the treaty undertakes not to
                        station or fix nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction on,
                        within, beneath or to the seabed beyond 12 nautical miles from its coast and
                        up to the coast of any other state.” <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                        also proposes that any verification required for compliance with the seabed
                        arms control agreement would be by “unilateral verification capabilities.”</p>
                    <p>3. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff do not
                        oppose the consideration of arms control measures provided such measures
                        will not have the effect of weakening the relative strategic posture of the
                        United States and if an effective control system is established. Reference
                        1b sets forth the views and recommendations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on
                        the broad subject of arms control measures on the seabeds. The Joint Chiefs
                        of Staff reaffirm those views at this time. In that memorandum, while noting
                        arguments that acceptance of a denuclearization proposal might serve the
                        immediate political purpose of helping to develop a climate of opinion
                        favorable to the Nonproliferation Treaty, the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated
                        that the long-range consequences of banning the emplacement of nuclear
                        weapons on the seabeds would be detrimental to the security of the United
                            <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0622"/>States. If, in the future, the
                        US nuclear capability were to depend in part on the emplacement of weapons
                        and devices on the ocean bottoms, the option for their use would be
                        politically foreclosed by the terms of this proposed agreement. While it is
                        premature to decide whether the United States should emplace weapons on the
                        seabeds in order to maintain the necessary strategic nuclear capacity in the
                        future, the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that such a requirement is a
                        distinct possibility. It is not a question of current programs but the risks
                        to future US strategic nuclear programs that must be the primary
                        consideration in appraising a seabed denuclearization proposal.</p>
                    <p>4. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Possible future risks to the US
                        nuclear forces include enhanced effects of nuclear weapons, such as X-rays
                        and electromagnetic pulse (EMP), on US strategic missile systems. Another
                        risk can be identified in terms of the advancing technology in long-range
                        underwater surveillance systems. Therefore, there is a reasonable
                        possibility that scientific or technological breakthroughs could make
                        present US strategic offensive and defensive missile systems vulnerable to
                        enemy attack. To counter this possibility, the United States might well be
                        required to expand its nuclear weapons deployment base to the seabeds.</p>
                    <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) If “pindown” and submarine
                        vulnerability were to become a reality, the geographical differences between
                        the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would become
                        of great importance. The fact that the Soviet Union has a land area over
                        twice that of the United States gives it an obvious land-development
                        advantage over the United States. However, the United States has a
                        conveniently located territorial base for the effective use and control of a
                        wide range of deep seabed areas in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans,
                        whereas Soviet access to the deep oceans is relatively restricted and
                        environmentally difficult. Soviet coastal control of sea bottom nuclear
                        sites and its range of site deployment would be significantly inferior to
                        that of the United States. Clearly, it would be in the best interests of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> if it could offset any US
                        geographical advantages with an international arms control agreement.</p>
                    <p>6. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) A distance limit in connection with a
                        seabed arms control proposal would prejudge and reduce the credibility of
                        our current position on territorial seas. This could adversely affect the US
                        bargaining position in forthcoming discussions on the breadth of the
                        territorial sea.</p>
                    <p>7. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The United States does not have a
                        verification capability now, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not believe
                        that any nation has now or will obtain such a capability in the foreseeable
                        future. In their opinion, an effective control system for a seabed
                        denuclearization agreement could not be developed satisfactorily, and an
                        international agreement by itself accomplishes little unless it can be
                        effectively enforced. An unverifiable agreement could encourage a false
                        sense of security in the United States. Lacking a dependable US
                        detection/verification system, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        could probably emplace significant numbers of weapons on the seabeds. It is
                            <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0623"/>important to note that even a
                        few nuclear weapons, if properly located, can seriously threaten US security
                        as was amply illustrated by Soviet clandestine emplacement of a few missiles
                        during the Cuban crisis.</p>
                    <p>8. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) In view of the above, the Joint Chiefs
                        of Staff believe that discussion and/or negotiations concerning the undersea
                        environment should be limited at this time to such matters as scientific
                        research, exploration and exploitation of resources, and establishment of
                        marine parks and preserves. Although future marine research and exploration
                        may well indicate that there could be arms control measures which would be
                        in the national interest, adoption of the present <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal would not be in the national interest and, in
                        fact, has a potential for grave harm.</p>
                    <p>9. (<gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>) In view of the wide variety of
                        argumentation presented in the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                        proposal, additional specific comments are provided in the Appendix.</p>

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> implies that the Pardo proposal<note n="5" xml:id="d236fn5">For the statements by the Maltese Representative,

                            for adoption by the United Nations, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on

                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly; whereas, in fact, it
                        was not adopted. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly did
                        adopt a US sponsored resolution to establish an ad hoc committee to study
                        the peaceful uses of the seabed and ocean floor.</p>
                    <p>B. (<hi rend="italic">

                    <p>1. The statement that the United States should develop a position with regard
                        to the seabed now, before technological possibilities become operational
                        programs, is not supportable. The fact that we do not know the ultimate use
                        of the seabed is reason enough for the United States to retain the option
                        for its future use.</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> states that the proposed measure
                        could be used to counter less acceptable measures which have been suggested
                        in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly Committee One and
                        the ad hoc committee. It is not appropriate to “counter less acceptable
                        measures” with other unacceptable measures.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>'s assumption that its proposal would
                        “preserve the nuclear-free status of the seabed” is insupportable. The value
                        of any agreement which does not include all nuclear-capable nations is
                        questionable.</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> stresses that its recommended US
                        position would: appear to be forthcoming with respect to the Soviet
                        demilitarization proposal; soothe purported feelings of resentment
                        concerning the Nonproliferation Treaty (<gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>); and demonstrate continued cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in dampening strategic nuclear
                        competition. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that a potentially vital US
                        strategic advantage should not be offered as a negotiation tactic, believing
                        it to be harmful to the national interest and dangerous to the security of
                        the United States. The <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> should be debated
                        on its own merits. Whatever derivative political benefits might result from
                        the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> seabed proposal in terms of
                        approval of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> are not at all clear and
                        in no case match the potential substantive US strategic advantage that might
                        thus be lost.</p>
                    <p>5. <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> assumes that the 12-mile proposal
                        would:</p>
                    <p>a. Be more acceptable than other possible formulations.</p>
                    <p>b. Avoid the issue of the extent of national jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>c. Not affect recognition of the breadth of the territorial sea.</p>
                    <p>These assumptions are not supportable. There is currently substantial support
                        in the world community for a 12-mile territorial sea. The endorsement of a
                        12-mile limit in connection with an arms control proposal would further
                        reduce the credibility of our current 3-mile position. This could adversely
                        affect the US bargaining position in forthcoming discussions with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on the subject of the breadth of the
                        territorial sea, and weaken US ability to obtain navigational rights for
                        vessels and aircraft which are necessary before a 12-mile limit can be
                        accepted.</p>

                    <p>1. A prohibition on the emplacement of nuclear weapons on the seabed could be
                        contrary to the security interest of the United States. The <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0625"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China have a combined
                        land area almost 3-1/2 times that of the United States and its possessions;
                        thus the land-deployment base of our most powerful potential enemies is
                        greatly superior to our own. Conversely, the United States enjoys greater
                        access to ocean areas than do the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                        Communist China. The <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> statement, that
                        the emplacement of weapons on the seabed does not appear to offer us any
                        significant strategic advantage because the United States currently has no
                        such program, is not supportable. Although strategic, technological, and
                        economic factors thus far have caused exploitation of the seabeds to be a
                        matter of lesser urgency than other development programs, there is not
                        justification for assuming that this condition will continue to exist
                        indefinitely. Strategic factors such as EMP X-rays and submarine
                        vulnerability may require the United States to expand its nuclear weapons
                        deployment base to the seabeds. It is not a question of current nuclear
                        programs but the risks to future US strategic nuclear programs that must be
                        the primary consideration in appraising a seabed denuclearization proposal.</p>
                    <p>2. The statement that the Soviets would forego the same options to use the
                        seabed as a potential area for deployment as the United States is
                        misleading. If it should become necessary to use the seabed because of
                        possible US strategic vulnerability, giving up options to utilize the seabed
                        could be of greater disadvantage to the United States than to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Soviet coastal control of sea bottom
                        nuclear sites and its range of site deployment would be significantly
                        inferior to that of the United States.</p>
                    <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> statement that, within 12 miles
                        of our coasts, the proposal would still leave us with over 140,000 square
                        miles of underwater area for weapon deployment is misleading. Weapon
                        dispersal considerations and the US geographical land deficiency compared to
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could dictate seabed weapon
                        deployments in the deep oceans.</p>
                    <p>D. (<hi rend="italic">

                    </p>
                    <p>1. <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposes reliance on unilateral
                        verification. It can be stated categorically that the United States does not
                        now have the necessary technology for unilateral verification. The Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff do not believe that any nation will obtain such a capability
                        in the foreseeable future. Any arms control agreements which lack effective
                        verification could work more to the detriment of the security of the United
                        States than no arms control agreement at all. An unverifiable agreement
                        could encourage a false sense of security in the United States while
                        creating an opportunity for nations disposed to exploit or circumvent
                        international agreements to gain significant military advantages.</p>
                    <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> assumption that undetected
                        weapons could be limited to “a few” is not supportable. Lacking a dependable
                        US detection/verification system, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        could probably covertly emplace significant <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0626"/>numbers of weapons on the seabeds. It is important to note
                        that even a few nuclear weapons, if properly located, can seriously threaten
                        US security as was amply illustrated by Soviet clandestine emplacement of a
                        few missiles during the Cuban crisis. In short, in the absence of a
                        detection/verification capability, there can be no real substance to an arms
                        control agreement—only trust—and history testifies to the ineffectiveness of
                        trust in restraining potential enemies.</p>
                    <p>3. Throughout the paper, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> states that
                        the existence of a seabed treaty should deter weapon emplacement and should
                        help the United States to obtain widespread “international support” for
                        whatever response to weapon emplacement on the seabeds by other nations the
                        United States would choose to promote. The degree and effectiveness of this
                        “support” is doubtful. Neither the existence of the Limited Test Ban Treaty
                        nor world opinion against atmospheric testing has restrained Communist China
                        and France from continuing such nuclear tests.</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> states that its proposal was drafted
                        to provide assurance that the collective security interest of the United
                        States and its allies would be protected. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe
                        that the proposal has a potential for grave harm and that some of our allies
                        may take the same view.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>I have endeavored to use this channel only when I consider that the matters
                        to be discussed are important and urgent.<note n="2" xml:id="d237fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d178fn3">footnote 3, Document 178</ref>.</note> In
                        that spirit I communicate with you now on the following subjects: (1) The
                        question of arms limitation in the Middle East, and (2) the long overdue
                        question of our discussion in regard to offensive and defensive ballistic
                        missiles.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of the Middle East crisis.]</p>
                    <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0627"/>
                    <p>The other subject I wish to take up with you again is my proposal, which goes
                        back to December 1966,<note n="3" xml:id="d237fn3">Not further identified;
                            however, at Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s
                            December 21, 1966, news conference questions regarding a possible freeze
                            on antiballistic missiles were posed to him. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> replied “we would regret very much the lifting of
                            the arms race to an entirely new plateau of major expenditures [for
                            antiballistic missiles].” See <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy:
                                Current Documents, 1967</hi>, p. 509.</note> in regard to holding
                        discussions with the aim of controlling the strategic arms race. I
                        understand from Ambassador Thompson that Foreign Minister Gromyko told him
                        on March 26 of this year that the Soviet Government was still studying the
                        problem and that it attaches importance to this subject. As the United
                        States Government has noted in previous communications, each passing month
                        increases the difficulty of reaching agreement on this matter as, from a
                        technical and military point of view, it is becoming more complex. But there
                        is an additional consideration which leads me to raise this matter with you
                        now.</p>
                    <p>As you are aware, the United Nations General Assembly has begun its
                        deliberations on the draft Non-Proliferation Treaty. This draft represents
                        the joint product of the efforts of our two governments.<note n="4" xml:id="d237fn4">On March 11, the United States and the Soviet Union
                            submitted a revised draft of the Non-Proliferation Treaty to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>. For text of this joint draft, see
                                <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1968</hi>, pp. 162-166.
                            This draft became the subject of an extensive debate in the General
                            Assembly, which reconvened on April 24.</note> I am confident that you
                        share my earnest hope that it will obtain the maximum number of adherents.
                        During the resumed General Assembly session our efforts to achieve a treaty
                        that can be opened for signature in the near future with the prospect of
                        obtaining a maximum number of adherents will face a critical test. Efforts
                        undoubtedly will be made by some states to postpone the opening of the
                        treaty for signature at least until after the conference of
                        non-nuclear-weapon states has been held in the fall of this year.<note n="5" xml:id="d237fn5">The U.N. Conference of Non-Nuclear Weapon States

                        is important that our two governments do everything possible to give the
                        greatest impetus to world sentiment favorable to opening the treaty for
                        signature at an early date.</p>
                    <p>To this end, I propose that our two governments announce early in the course
                        of the General Assembly debate that they have agreed to begin bilateral
                        negotiations on an agreement to limit strategic offensive and defensive
                        missiles within a specific time from the date of the announcement, as well
                        as proceeding to discuss the related matters mentioned above. I would hope
                        that such a declaration, of primary importance in itself, would do much to
                        ensure the successful completion of work on the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>

                    <p>The Committee of Principals discussed an <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal to prohibit the fixing of nuclear or other weapons of

                        the Principals to the President. Since a U.S. position will be needed by
                        June 17, the Deputies were directed to prepare such an analysis in time for

                        question before the Principals: Should the U.S. support international action
                        to prohibit the stationing of nuclear weapons in the deep ocean? Putting
                        aside for the moment what the exact boundaries should be, is it advisable to
                        create a nuclear free environment in the deep oceans like that in the

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said that, to answer
                        this question, one should ask another question: What kind of an area would
                        the U.S. want as a platform for its strategic nuclear delivery vehicles?
                        Would we want it to be small, limited and closer to cities? He thought the
                        answer to this question was negative. The Soviet Union has a larger land
                        mass than the United States. The U.S. has better access to the sea than does
                        the Soviet Union. The sea was, therefore, a better place for the U.S. to put
                        nuclear weapons than for the Soviet Union. General Wheeler added that the
                        Principals should consider what the problems might be in 20 years. There
                        were now developments in Soviet weapons which give us difficulty. In the
                        future, with further developments on the Soviet side, ocean bottoms could be
                        a desirable deployment area for U.S. strategic weapons.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Wenk pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal
                        was limited to fixed emplacements. He asked whether it would embrace the
                        anchoring of Polaris submarines. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> replied that the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                        proposal would not affect anchoring incidental to the purpose of navigation
                        or perhaps for other reasons. Secretary Rusk said that if there were fixed
                        anchoring, the submarine would be in trouble under the proposal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> then asked General
                            <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> exactly what kinds of
                        systems the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> was considering for the
                        bottom of the sea. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>
                        listed the “ULM” (a submarine mobile platform carrying <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s), the “Turtle” (a bottom crawler or
                        sitter), the “Sinbad” (a three-section submersible, the midsection remains
                        on station and the end sections provide transportation and support), and
                        tunnels for encapsulated missiles (“Rocksite”). He added that none of these
                        devices were in today's 5-year program for <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> developments. However, they are under consideration, and there
                        might come a time when they would be desirable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> pointed out that it was
                        U.S. policy to move toward halting the nuclear arms race in all
                        environments, and that non-armament was <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0630"/>usually much easier than disarmament to accomplish. He
                        added that the proposals of the Soviet Union and many other countries went
                        much further than did <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>'s proposal. The
                        UN debates had considered complete demilitarization of the seabed and
                        reserving it for peaceful uses only, whereas the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal dealt only with weapons of mass destruction. He
                        thought the best defense against other proposals was a good offensive,
                        namely, a good proposal of our own. He listed the political advantages of
                        the proposal and added that he thought it would contribute to U.S. security.
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> pointed out that whenever
                        a new class of weapons was discussed there was a fundamental dilemma: Was
                        there greater risk in limiting such an expansion of the nuclear arms race
                        and foreclosing future military options than there was in developing and
                        deploying the new weapons?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> thought that the
                        problems involving arms control of the deep ocean bed had not been thought
                        through to the same degree as had been the problems involved in the test
                        ban. He pointed to two specific problems: (1) What was the relationship of
                        the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal to the Law of the
                            Sea?<note n="6" xml:id="d238fn6">The Law of the Sea Treaty on fishing
                            and conservation of living resources of the high seas was signed by 35
                            nations on April 29, 1958, in Geneva and entered into force on March 20,
                            1966. The U.S. signed the Treaty with an understanding. For text, see 17
                            UST 138.</note> He added that we have disagreements with the Soviet
                        Union on where the baseline is from which to measure the breadth of the
                        territorial sea. We are now working on developing a position concerning a
                        new Law of the Sea treaty. The relationship of the Law of the Sea problems
                        to the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal must be thought
                        through. (2) The most significant arms control measure to be discussed with
                        the Soviet Union was a freeze on offensive and defensive missiles. For that
                        discussion, it had been decided to exclude mobile land-based
                        intercontinental missiles because the verification problem was difficult. In
                        Secretary Nitze's view, the verification problems involved in the deep
                        oceans were far greater. Under these circumstances, Secretary Nitze
                        questioned whether we should be considering arms control for the deep
                        oceans. He added that the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> paper was
                        more polemical than analytical. He thought that a subcommittee of the
                        Principals should work out an agreed analysis to form the basis of the US
                        position. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> stated that
                        precise definitions of what was prohibited and what was permitted were
                        necessary. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> agreed that the
                        strategic missile freeze was a more important measure but pointed out that
                        it could only be discussed bilaterally with the Soviet Union at the present
                        time. The seabed proposal was already being discussed at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on a multilateral basis, and the U.S. needed
                        to have a position. He thought the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                        proposal would not interfere with the Law of the Sea negotiations. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> added that, in any event,
                        countries favoring the 3-mile limit were a disappearing breed. He <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0631"/>didn't think differences over the
                        breadth of the territorial sea should be conclusive of the Government's
                        decision on the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then spoke of the need
                        to prevent further diversion of scarce national resources to the development
                        and deployment of more sophisticated nuclear weaponry. He pointed out that
                        both sides already had enough weapons to destroy the US, Soviet Union and
                        Europe, and he doubted that our large stockpiles had increased the security
                        of the American people. He hoped, if possible, to avoid pursuit of a higher
                        plateau in the nuclear arms race which would not increase our security. If
                        the Soviet Union deployed nuclear weapons on the bottom of the sea, he said,
                        their target would be U.S. cities. We could not transfer the Soviet target
                        for these or other ballistic missiles to the ocean by our deploying nuclear
                        weapons on the ocean bottom. He asked why the same considerations which have
                        resulted in placing Antarctica and outer space off limits should not apply
                        to the seabed. He thought that such deployments would be a futile exercise
                        and very expensive. Unless the human race found a way to limit the arms race
                        and prevent further massive diversion of resources to weapons, we were in
                        deep trouble.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> suggested a fast staff
                        study for the Principals. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>
                        said the Deputies to the Principals could handle such a study. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> thought they should consider
                        such problems as (1) whether the baseline should be that set forth in
                        earlier Law of the Sea treaties, or simply the low water mark, (2) whether
                        the proposal should deal with “emplacing” nuclear weapons on the seabed and
                        (3) whether the proposal could be simplified for further discussion. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> added that the problem of
                        how long a submarine could sit on the bottom should be dealt with by the
                        Deputies.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked how accessible the
                        deep ocean bed was now. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said that by 1969 we would be able to go down 4,000 feet
                        deep in the ocean. Dr. Wenk said that this was with one small, experimental
                        submarine designed in 1960. He added that there was a long way to go and a
                        lot of money involved before deployment of a strategic weapons system would
                        be possible. The small research submarine had cost $60 million. Effective
                        nuclear weapons systems would be enormously more costly.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> pointed out that the deep
                        ocean was not an attractive prospect for strategic weapons deployment now.
                        He didn't see how one could really study the possibility in great detail
                        since so little was known. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> suggested that the tops of under water mountains might
                        be attractive locations for deployment. Dr. Hornig replied that they might
                        be and that the Bering Sea might also be attractive, but a very major
                        deployment expense was involved in either case for either side.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> indicated that stationing
                        nuclear weapons on the seabed would involve a host of problems such as how
                        to protect the weapons from theft or accidental triggering. He doubted that
                        the U.S. would want to put many nuclear weapons at remote distances from its
                        shore. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> added that to do so
                        would be destabilizing. Dr. Wenk asked who would benefit by moving in this
                        direction. The <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> paper, he said,
                        suggested that a nation with a few nuclear weapons might use them for crude
                        nuclear mines. He added that with the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                        proposal in effect, the U.S. would be in a better position to get wide
                        political support for dealing with such a deployment. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> replied that countries didn't
                        ordinarily deploy mines in peace time. In war time, the treaty would be
                        ineffective. Dr. Wenk thought that it was still the country with the small
                        nuclear force which might find deployment of nuclear weapons on the seabed
                        advantageous. He suggested that the Chinese Communists might do so and that
                        the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> paper would give the U.S. a better
                        political basis for dealing with the problem if they did.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked whether the
                        Soviets knew about our <gloss target="#t_SOSUS1">SOSUS</gloss> system.
                        Admiral Taylor said they did. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested that if our proposal dealt with weapons of mass
                        destruction and the Soviet proposal dealt with complete demilitarization,
                        there would probably be a standoff between the two.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> asked whether the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal would be violated if the U.S.
                        lost another nuclear weapon on the bottom of the sea. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> replied there would be no violation.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked about the problem
                        of verification. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> replied
                        that this was a difficult problem because the sea was so vast. If you know
                        where to hunt, you may well find a nuclear weapon deployed on the bottom of
                        the sea. If there is a large-scale construction involved, you could probably
                        detect it. On the other hand, he was not happy about verifying deployment of
                        one or a few nuclear weapons on the seabed. But this problem was with us
                        with or without the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that this sounded
                        similar to the problem of verification involved in the Outer Space Treaty.
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> pointed out that a country
                        deploying strategic weapons system on the seabed which might threaten us
                        would need an adequate command and control system which would probably
                        involve a communications system which could be detectable. In addition, the
                        country would need to move a great deal of material. Clandestine deployment
                        would be quite difficult. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>
                        agreed. If there were a large deployment, he added, we would find it. If it
                        was sneaky and small, it might escape our detection.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said he was
                        sympathetic to the need for a U.S. position but more precise staff work was
                        needed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> added that, at
                        a minimum, we must have speech material for the U.S. representative by June
                        17. He pointed to the need for giving the President sufficient time to deal
                        with this problem and hoped we could avoid presenting it to him at the last
                        minute. He asked for a initial paper to be submitted by the Deputies to the
                        Principals for consideration by June 5.</p>

                    <p>Both the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName>
                        expressed their appreciation for the close cooperation which had taken place
                        at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> between the Soviet and American
                        delegations on the handling of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. The
                        Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> agreed that
                        this close collaboration should continue; that the two governments should
                        stand firm against any changes, certainly for the time being; and that if,
                        at the very end, and if both agree, there were minor changes in the text of
                        the Treaty which would not affect basic substance, and if by these changes
                        it would be possible to get significantly wider adherence to the Treaty, the
                        two governments would then consider whether these changes could be accepted.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> emphasized that he was
                        under instructions to agree to no changes at present and stressed the
                        problem of opening a Pandora's box if alterations were to be considered at
                        this stage.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> agreed
                        that the two countries could be more flexible in dealing with the proposed

                        <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> said that before coming to
                        Washington he had had a talk with <persName corresp="#p_GRA1">Robles</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Delegate of
                        Mexico, which was the leader of the Latin American group. He stressed the
                        importance of bringing around the Latin American vote and urged that the US
                        do everything it could to <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0635"/>bring the
                        Latin Americans into line. The outlook was not discouraging, but US help was
                        needed. The Secretary said that we would do everything that we could on an
                        urgent basis. According to <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GRA1">Robles</persName> had said that the Mexicans
                        would sign the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> even if there were no
                        changes in the text, but <persName corresp="#p_GRA1">Robles</persName> urged
                        changes in order to bring around the rest of the group. The Secretary
                        observed that <persName corresp="#p_GRA1">Robles</persName> was probably
                        more Mexican than the Mexicans. He pointed out that Carrillo Flores, the
                        Mexican Foreign Secretary, was personally strongly in favor of the Treaty.</p>

                        them to the principles of the Treaty of Tlatelolco which they are still
                        considering and about which they have reservations on two main points:</p>

                    <p>Turning to Brazil, the Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> that the US was not in agreement with the Brazilians
                        on their proposed amendment regarding peaceful nuclear explosive devices
                            (Pineds).<note n="5" xml:id="d239fn5">Brazil was one of several <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> members which urged that peaceful
                            nuclear explosions should be exempt from prohibition under Articles I
                            and II of the Non-Proliferation Treaty because Article 18 of the Treaty
                            of Tlatelolco (see <ref target="#d226fn2">footnote 2, Document
                            226</ref>) specifically permitted the signatories to carry out nuclear
                            explosions for peaceful purposes under international inspection, either
                            with their own resources or in cooperation with third parties. See the
                            statement by Brazil's Foreign Minister de Magalhaes Pinto to the First
                            Committee of the General Assembly, May 3, regarding Brazil's proposed
                            amendments to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, printed in <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1968</hi>, pp. 278-283.</note> He said
                        that the Brazilian Foreign Minister had told him that the Brazilians would
                        not press their amendment on this subject or urge the other Latin Americans
                        to support it. He thought the Brazilians would probably not sign the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> now but might come along later. He observed
                        that the Brazilians, like a number of other countries, were attempting to
                        use the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> in order to get bilateral
                        bargaining advantages from the US on such questions as fuel supply, peaceful
                        uses, the S.W. Africa issue, etc. <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> said he hoped we would make good use of our bargaining
                        power to get adherence to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>Reference was made to the fact that Mexican Foreign Secretary Carrillo Flores
                        was now visiting Moscow. It was suggested that the Soviets could raise the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> with him during his visit, while the
                        US would approach the Mexicans in Washington or Mexico City.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> said that the Africans were
                        being troublesome. The African opposition bloc was led by Ghana, Tanzania
                        and Kenya. Their tactic is to promote a resolution which would postpone
                        consideration of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> until the 23rd
                            <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> had had a talk with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representative of Kenya within the last few days and had
                        ascertained that an important element in the African position was the
                        attitude of South Africa on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. If the
                        South Africans could be brought to support the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> unequivocally, this could be very important in swinging the
                        entire African vote. At this point the Secretary showed <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> a telegram which the Department
                        had received this morning from our Mission in South Africa, explaining some
                        of the South African preoccupations and recommending that a US technical
                        expert be sent to Pretoria in order to clarify these problems. The Secretary
                        said that the US would take steps to do this immediately in an effort to
                        help the situation.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether the Soviets felt that the negative Tanzanian
                        attitude was influenced by the Chinese. Kuznetsov said that the Soviets were
                        quite certain of it. The Tanzanians had said at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> was nonsense
                        and what really mattered was disarmament. Their whole idea is to postpone
                        the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> with the hope it will be killed. In
                        response to <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName>'s question as
                        to whether the US could do something with Tanzania, the Secretary replied
                        that our relations were only fair, but we would do what we could.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName>
                        felt that the Africans were attempting to use the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> as a means of pressing their views on S.W. Africa.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> confirmed that they
                        were and referred to a recent Asian-African meeting at which a decision was
                        reached that there would be no action on <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                        until the S.W. African problem was solved. The Secretary said that this
                        created real difficulties.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> what he felt was the attitude of
                        the francophone Africans. <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName>
                        said “not good”; that according to a recent talk he had with Bernard (French
                        Ambassador to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>) the French would be
                        neutral on <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> although it really favors the
                        Treaty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> recalled that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had said a few years
                        ago that he did not believe in treaties which have no real powers of
                        enforcement.</p>
                    <p>Concluding this aspect of the discussion <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> once again emphasized the importance of the Latin
                        American vote and the importance of US efforts with the Latin American
                        countries to obtain favorable results.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> observer at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> (Von Braun) had recently distributed a press release (which he
                        said had been prepared over a year ago, but with new thoughts introduced)
                        designed to bring uncertainty and doubt about the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. The Soviets were wondering whether they should not speak
                        out against this action. From the Soviet view, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is trying to sow seeds of doubt. Meanwhile, while the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has two people at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> can't
                        get visas from the US to be present at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and the Soviets think that they should.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that, speaking very frankly, he would like to offer the
                        Soviets some advice. There was an internal problem in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.
                        Some were hostile to it, but others, including <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>,
                        were prepared to move. Birrenbach was troubled; Strauss was not in favor.
                        The Secretary thought that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would
                        sign the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, but he advised the Soviets not
                        to make an issue about the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> observer's
                        statement; this would only complicate an already serious problem both for
                        the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and for the US and would make more
                        difficult <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> support for the Treaty. In any
                        event, he said, the question of a <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                        observer at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> raised a difficult problem
                        in itself.</p>
                    <p>(Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> briefly mentioned the
                        recent <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> interference with the travel of
                        West German citizens over the autobahns to Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> quickly said this was an entirely
                        different question and had nothing to do with the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> said he
                        had raised the matter only because <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> had mentioned the question of visas for <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> observers at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.)</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said one of the reasons for the internal opposition in the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> was the thought of making a commitment to the Soviet Union for
                        nothing in return. The US would like to keep the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> quite separate from all extraneous matters and he again urged
                        that the Soviets take no action regarding the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> statement at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He added
                        that the members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> were strongly
                        interested in assurances of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> adherence to
                        the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> for reasons which would be
                        understood.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">US-Soviet Talks on Nuclear Weapons</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> acknowledged that if the
                        United States and the Soviet Union could agree to start bilateral talks on
                        limiting strategic nuclear weapons this would be helpful at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.
                        However he could only say that Moscow was still considering the US proposal
                        that talks begin.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Security Assurances</p>
                    <p>Responding to the Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName>
                        said that there is considerable dissatisfaction at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> over security assurances. There was the
                        problem of when to put the draft resolution to the Security Council. The
                        membership problem was not encouraging and it would not be easy to find 9
                        members in support of it. He had tried to find out what the French <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0638"/>attitude would be. The French
                        delegate had told him that he would not be active, but had no answer on the
                        final French position. Probably they would abstain. India would probably
                        also abstain. Ethiopia and Pakistan were doubtful.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary thought that Japan and India face the most serious problem in
                        connection with security assurances. He said that he personally was 1000%
                        against India becoming a nuclear-weapon state; but that if he were the
                        Foreign Minister of India he would certainly understand the difficulties
                        confronting India in view of the Chinese threat.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> said the Japanese were very
                        active in the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and have prepared a draft
                        statement. Japanese reservations relate to the questions of security
                        assurances, peaceful uses and disarmament.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said his personal view was that Japan would sign; <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> thought that they and others
                        would nevertheless try to postpone.</p>
                    <p>Responding to the Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName>
                        said that he had no definite answer from the Romanians. The Romanians were
                        not active in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. His best guess was that
                        the Romanians would not vote in favor of the GA resolution endorsing the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, but would abstain.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary emphasized two points in connection with security assurances
                        and the position of the US:</p>
                    <p>1. The US is not prepared to enter into any additional commitments of
                        alliance in order to give security assurances relating to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. We have enough allies as it is and the
                        Senate will not approve any additions.</p>
                    <p>2. The US is not ready to entertain the prospect of a possible war with the
                        Soviet Union in order to get the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the Security Council approach which we had agreed upon with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is the only approach possible for
                        the US.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary added that there are few people who truly understand the real
                        meaning of nuclear war—perhaps not more than 25 or 30 in the US. <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> said that the Soviet Union
                        understood it very well. The <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> had been
                        under the highest consideration in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        which had concluded that the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                        negotiations were of the highest importance and the only way to stop
                        proliferation. He returned to the importance of solidarity between the US
                        and Soviet Union in not making any material changes in the Treaty except as
                        outlined above.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Procedures for Signing <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the US has not made up its mind on the procedure for
                        signing the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. This would have to be
                        discussed with the President. The US had no strong objections to signing the
                        Treaty at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> in Geneva. But if this
                        procedure were adopted two problems would arise. If signature of the Treaty
                        were open to all on this occasion, then the question of the non-recognized
                        (implicitly the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) would arise. If signing
                        were limited to members of the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>, there
                        is the question <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0639"/>of how many members
                        we could get to sign. Perhaps it would be less complicated to use the
                        formula followed in connection with the Outer Space Treaty, i.e., to sign in
                        the capitals of the 3 depository powers. Kuznetsov said that the Soviets
                        favored signing in Geneva in order to maximize public attention to the
                        importance of the treaty. This would be analogous to the procedure followed
                        for the Test Ban Treaty (which was signed at one place, in Moscow). He said
                        that if problems should arise about non-recognized states (presumably
                        referring to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) in a Geneva ceremony, he
                        thought that this could be taken care of.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then made a personal suggestion, which he asked the Soviet side
                        not to report, that perhaps there could be an initialing of the text in
                        Geneva with formal signatures taking place in the capitals of the 3
                        depository powers. He said that he would talk over this whole question with
                        the President.</p>

                    <p>The timing of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> debate in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> makes it extremely opportune for the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> to be a central theme in a speech
                        delivered in Glassboro on June 4. The plan is now to submit to Committee I
                        on Wednesday of next week<note n="3" xml:id="d240fn3">May 29.</note> the
                        agreed text of a resolution endorsing the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, together with a final version of the treaty. There is every
                        indication that there will be a very substantial majority voting for it
                        although some of the key countries will abstain.</p>
                    <p>In order to minimize the possibility of further amendments, it is planned to
                        bring the resolution to a final vote as soon as possible. It is now
                        estimated that the vote on the resolution will come on June 4! The <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0640"/>resolution will then be referred to
                        the Plenary session of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> and will be
                        voted on there again after a week or so. Although normally the vote would be
                        the same in both forums, there is in this case a real possibility that some
                        of the expected abstentions in Committee I might change to positive votes in
                        the Plenary.</p>
                    <p>The fact that the vote in Committee I and the speech may be on the same day
                        presents the speech writer with some problems. We might be able to speed up
                        the vote by one day and we could certainly delay it a few days.</p>
                    <p>After the vote, the speech could welcome the first international endorsement
                        of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and at the same time to maintain
                        the pressure looking toward an even stronger vote of endorsement in the
                        Plenary of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. Before the vote, the
                        speech could anticipate the international endorsement and maintain pressure
                        on those who were undecided whether to vote yes or abstain in Committee I.</p>
                    <p>I think the President might make the following points:</p>
                    <p>1. Welcome, or encourage, endorsement of <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                        by Committee I.</p>
                    <p>2. Identify critical nature of nuclear proliferation problem.</p>
                    <p>3. Note the three purposes served by the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>:</p>
                    <p>a. Prevent proliferation.</p>
                    <p>b. Permit peaceful uses of the atom without fear of diversion to nuclear

                    <p>At the meeting of the Deputies to the Committee of Principals on May 27,
                        1968, the Deputies discussed the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                        proposal as amended and the key issues identified by the Committee of
                        Principals at its meeting on May 14, 1968.<note n="2" xml:id="d241fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d238">Document 238</ref>.</note> This report
                        represents the extent of agreement reached by the Deputies with the
                        exception of the representative of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff, who does not concur in any portion thereof. The views of the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff are attached hereto as Tab A.<note n="3" xml:id="d241fn3">See <ref target="#d236">Document 236</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to avoid legal complications and to clarify the fact that the
                        proposal would not limit the deployment of submarines, we recommend that the
                        proposal be amended to read as follows:</p>
                    <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0642"/>
                    <p>“Each State Party to this Treaty undertakes not to [station],<note n="4" xml:id="d241fn4">All brackets are in the source text.</note> emplace, or
                            fix<note n="5" xml:id="d241fn5">The Department of Defense prefers to
                            use, “implant nuclear weapons or other weapons … ” [Footnote in the
                            source text.]</note> nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass
                        destruction on, within, beneath, or to the seabed beyond 12 nautical miles
                        from its coast and up to the coast of any other state. For the purposes of
                        this Treaty only, the term 'coast' is defined as the [baseline from which
                        the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.] low water line along the
                        coast.”</p>
                    <p>At the meeting of the Principals, the Secretary of State indicated that a
                        U.S. position concerning arms control on the seabed is required in advance
                        of the resumption of the U.N. Ad Hoc Committee on June 17, 1968 in order to
                        be able to respond to views expressed by other governments. The U.S. needs a
                        position in order to deal effectively with the proposals of other nations
                        which could adversely affect U.S. security interests. A “demilitarization”
                        proposal is clearly unacceptable. The “peaceful purposes only” approach
                        would require carefully considered qualifications to be compatible with
                        certain defensive military purposes. Adoption of a basic position on
                        denuclearization would enable the U.S. to take a positive approach to arms
                        control in a new environment, and at the same time fend off other less
                        acceptable proposals.</p>
                    <p>The Principals instructed the Deputies to analyze certain particular issues
                        to serve as a basis for a recommendation by the Principals to the President.
                        The following paragraphs present the views of the Deputies on the four major
                        issues.</p>
                    <p>1. There is general agreement on the intended interpretation of what would be
                        prohibited or permitted under the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                        seabed proposal as amended. This interpretation is based on the illustrative
                        listing in Tab B attached hereto.<note n="6" xml:id="d241fn6">This
                            attachment, entitled “Weapons Systems Prohibited or Permitted under
                                <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> Seabed Proposal,” is not
                            printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. The Legal Adviser of the Department of State advises that the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal, as amended, when coupled with
                        explanatory comments as to our position, will not adversely prejudice future
                        U.S. legal positions concerning the law of the sea.<note n="7" xml:id="d241fn7">See <ref target="#d238fn6">footnote 6, Document
                            238</ref>. A handwritten notation next to this paragraph reads: “<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> questions this.” </note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. Although we see no military advantage to the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal, it is our belief that this measure is in the overall
                        net U.S. interest.<note n="8" xml:id="d241fn8">A handwritten notation next
                            to this paragraph reads: “uneasy that State believes we have been
                            mousetrapped [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].”</note> There are no planned
                        systems in current <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> plans which are
                        prohibited. The option to employ mobile sea-based systems (submarines) is
                        preserved, and such systems can probably redress foreseeable asymmetries;
                        permanently <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0643"/>fixed sea-based systems
                        are probably not necessary for this purpose. We recognize that future
                        technological breakthroughs might jeopardize some of our existing weapons
                        systems; however, we believe that the economic savings and political
                        benefits from proscribing the emplacement of nuclear weapons in this new
                        environment may outweigh these rather remote and unforeseen contingencies.</p>
                    <p>4. U.S. capabilities to verify unilaterally compliance with the Treaty would
                        vary in different circumstances. We could not count on detecting and
                        identifying a seabed system in the Ramp;D phase, but there is a good chance
                        that we would detect the fact of development of most such systems before
                        they become operational. The detection and identification of an encapsulated
                        weapon system would be less likely than in the case of other new systems.
                        Deployment of nuclear weapons in fixed installations which require
                        substantial construction under the open ocean would almost certainly be
                        detected. Our capabilities to detect the deployment of a few “bottom
                        crawlers” or other similar systems which rested on the bottom, or of
                        individually encapsulated weapons would be minimal. The fact of deployment
                        of a large number of such weapons would probably be detected. Once we had
                        learned that such weapons had been deployed, and the approximate location of
                        such deployment, our capability to verify the deployment and the nature of
                        the weapon<note n="9" xml:id="d241fn9">A handwritten notation inserted after
                            this word reads: “by obtaining at least one sample.”</note> would be
                            good.<note n="10" xml:id="d241fn10">A handwritten notation at the end of
                            this sentence reads: “in the probable time scale implied.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>We believe it highly unlikely that the Soviet Union would deploy large
                        numbers of unprotected systems, such as individually encapsulated nuclear
                        missiles, on the seabed due to the problems of command and control and the
                        risk of one or more being discovered and acquired by the U.S.<note n="11" xml:id="d241fn11">A handwritten notation next to this paragraph reads:
                            “other than Sovs?”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The verification capability indicated above appears to be adequate to protect
                        U.S. security interests when considered in conjunction with the current and
                        projected strategic balance, the limited relative advantage to the Soviet
                        Union of clandestine deployments of this kind on the seabed, and the
                        political penalties attached to the detection of such deployments.</p>

                        was requested to review its position on U.S. unilateral verification
                        capabilities. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLC1">Meeker</persName> was to be

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> commented on the four
                        principal points made in the Deputies Report of May 27.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> queried whether there
                        was not a rough analogy in this situation to the Outer Space Treaty<note n="5" xml:id="d242fn5">See <ref target="#d238fn5">footnote 5, Document
                                238</ref>.</note> negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> said it was roughly the

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> stated there was a problem.
                        Under the Outer Space Treaty, the Soviets could orbit everything but the
                        nuclear warhead. Under the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal,
                        the Soviets could deploy the weapon system on the seabed, to be armed with
                        nuclear weapons at a time of their choosing—without (until the moment of
                        arming) there being a violation of the treaty. They could aim for a first
                        strike capability.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said we would know if the
                        Soviets made a substantial deployment—we can keep track of the changes in
                        their strategic position.</p>
                    <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0645"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s statement remains accurate: the

                        to the Outer Space Treaty.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said that the seabed
                        proposal would face a difficult time in the Senate. The Senate was much
                        concerned with the Soviet FOBS development which followed on ratification of
                        the Outer Space Treaty. He added that he had problems with each one of the
                        four conclusions in the Deputies' Report. As to the first which stated that
                        the Deputies were in general agreement on the interpretation of what would
                        be permitted and what would be prohibited, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> disagreed saying that the Soviets could, without
                        treaty violation, deploy the weapons system minus warheads.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the second conclusion to the effect that the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal, as amended, would not adversely
                        prejudice future U.S. legal positions concerning the law of the sea,<note n="6" xml:id="d242fn6">See <ref target="#d238fn6">footnote 6, Document
                                238</ref>.</note> R.Adm. Hearn doesn't share Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLC1">Meeker</persName>'s views. Adm. Hearn believes that
                        substantial questions are involved such as the 12-mile territorial sea. The
                        definition of the coast in the draft treaty text annexed to the proposal is
                        tautological and does not take into account the USSR views on their
                        so-called “internal seas.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said such a definition
                        probably was prejudicial to Soviet views on territorial seas but not to the
                        U.S. Use of the 12-mile exclusion zone raises a presumption that we are
                        getting involved in the territorial sea, but we can make clear that this
                        proposal has nothing to do with the law of the territorial sea. Perhaps we
                        could accept some other outer limit such as 25 miles.</p>
                    <p>Adm. Taylor asked if the 100 fathom isobath was practicable as the outer
                        limits.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Wenk said that isobath would have a tendency to be confused with the 200
                        meter isobath defining the outer limits of the continental shelf which, in
                        some cases, is found at a distance of 156 miles from the coast. He believes
                        that any line in terms of distance was less harmful than one in terms of
                        depth.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> if <gloss target="#t_JAG1">JAG</gloss>'s views would be met if we separated completely the outer
                        limits of the exclusionary zone in the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                        proposal from the law of the territorial seas?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> replied that he wasn't sure.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> noted that it would solve a
                        psychological problem. The considerations involved in the proposal differ
                        from those involved in the law of the sea.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he saw no
                        disadvantage in the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal in an
                        outer limit of the coastal zone which is clearly not related to the law <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0646"/>of the sea. He suggested that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MLC1">Meeker</persName> and Adm. Hearn meet to
                        resolve any differences.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said he also had
                        difficulties with the third paragraph in the Deputies' Report relating to
                        the absence of military advantages and to the presence of economic savings
                        and political benefits in the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                        proposal. He could not see any economic savings since we may never wish a
                        seabed deployment at all. We are talking of possibilities which may occur
                        some 10 to 20 years in the future in the light of a technology much more
                        advanced than it is today. We could be interested in alternatives to land
                        based or submarine launched missiles. The seabed could offer the most
                        economical alternative—unless we are to assume that we should not want such
                        a deployment.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said the basic economic
                        savings would be to avoid any expense by precluding an arms race on the
                        seabed.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked if the
                            Antarctic<note n="7" xml:id="d242fn7">See <ref target="#d238fn4">footnote 4, Document 238</ref>.</note> situation did not provide an
                        analogy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said that was not
                        necessarily so.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> stated it was U.S. policy
                        to eliminate nuclear weapons in the entire world. First in Antarctica, then
                        testing in the atmosphere, next deployment in Outer Space and now on the
                        seabed. We can't eliminate such weapons in one day but the seabed represents
                        an additional environment. When one considers the astronomical estimates of
                        deployment costs reflected in the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> staff
                            paper,<note n="8" xml:id="d242fn8">Presumably a reference to <ref target="#d236">Document 236</ref> in which the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            commented extensively on the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>
                            proposal.</note> one is astonished. A movement in this direction would
                        conform to our overall arms control policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> replied that the same
                        principle could be applied to submarines even though it was more expensive
                        to deploy missiles on land where it costs more than submarine systems to get
                        the same degree of assured destructive capability. He found the logic of the
                        situation wanting.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> said we would have to
                        assume the seabed had as much potential as submarines to make such an
                        argument.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> added that if we decided
                        in favor of such deployment, enormous defense budgets for this purpose would
                        be inevitable.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_TGF1">Tape</persName> said that the economic
                        savings conclusion in the Deputies' Report was based on the assumption that
                        we would retain submarines, and that no other system appeared more useful.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> replied that a mobile force
                        was less costly and would not involve giving up anything.</p>
                    <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611" facs="0647"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_TGF1">Tape</persName> said that any missile silo
                        (Rocksite) program would be prohibitively expensive, so why do it.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said it was his personal
                        view that it was a military disadvantage to even have invented missiles.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> added that thermonuclear
                        weapons were terrible.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> stated that the same
                        opinions had been expressed some 400 years ago with regard to gunpowder.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> said that the same
                        disadvantages were cited years ago against the Limited Test Ban Treaty.<note n="9" xml:id="d242fn9">See <ref target="#d3">Document 3</ref>.</note>
                        Obviously other reasons had been found to more than compensate for the
                        disadvantages.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH1">Marks</persName> said that the argument
                        applied to every new weapons system, and that this renunciation of a
                        military option was a cheap price to pay for lessening of tension.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> queried whether the
                            <gloss target="#t_LTBT1">LTBT</gloss> had resulted in a reduction of
                        expenditures for testing.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> replied that underground
                        testing was extremely expensive.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> replied that any advantage
                        in <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>'s proposal would be political, but
                        that he had not seen much analysis of political gains. The proposal, if
                        agreed, would be unverifiable, however.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> asked whether we would
                        stand for the deployment of such a seabased weapon system, without warheads?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said we'd denounce the
                        treaty.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> said he also had thought
                        we would denounce the Outer Space Treaty under a similar situation, but now
                        had serious doubts that we would denounce either treaty under such
                        conditions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Wenk gave his views on the economic savings and political benefits. The
                        first related to the arms control measure which involved trade offs. The
                        second involved international cooperation and collaboration in the
                        sea—through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and other agencies. He
                        believed that the present set of U.S. proposals on seabed resources could
                        not proceed without an arms control measure. The political benefits were of
                        an immediate nature which had to be weighed against the hypothetical long
                        term military contingencies. The U.S. would be in a far weaker position on
                        its overall long term seabed policy if it took a negativistic point of view
                        towards arms limitations. The <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal
                        represents almost the least we can do.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> replied that the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal, if adopted, may not be
                        acceptable to other nations and we'll be pressured to go further.</p>
                    <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0648"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said he didn't think the
                        proposal would be unacceptable to other nations. The Soviet
                        “demilitarization” proposal would knock out <gloss target="#t_SOSUS1">SOSUS</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>'s proposal is
                        realistic. We wouldn't negotiate a treaty at the U.N. but rather in the
                            <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>. We would state a general arms
                        control principle at the U.N. to accomplish the U.S. policy of limiting
                        nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said this proposal would
                        take care of 98% of the apparent objectives in the Soviet Arms control
                        proposals.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Wenk added he did not believe the Soviets were serious about their
                        “demilitarization” proposal, but they would capitalize enormously on the
                        political level if the U.S. were to do nothing in this field.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> said he joined Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> in the latter's stated
                        views. He pointed out that if the Soviets were to deploy large numbers of
                        weapons on the ocean floor, we could detect a massive underwater undertaking
                        but nothing more. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> disagreed with the
                        Deputies' judgment on U.S. verification capabilities as reflected in their
                        report. He added that he did not believe that the Soviets would most likely
                        not opt for seabed deployment. The U.S. had not seen that FOBS were in the
                        net U.S. advantage, but the Soviets had concluded it was to their advantage.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked if we had any
                        information whether the Soviets were deploying that kind of system (FOBS).</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> said the Soviets appeared to
                        be flight testing FOBS.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> said it was not clear
                        whether the Soviets were developing FOBS or ballistic missiles with
                        depressed trajectories and deboost capabilities.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked whether we had any
                        indications that the Soviets were contemplating a seabed nuclear weapon
                        system.</p>
                    <p>Adm. Taylor said that we had no indications and that it did not appear that
                        the Soviets require a system of this type. The U.S. verification
                        capabilities are based on a combination of sensors. We have to consider that
                        the magnitude of the task of emplacement would be detectable. Once the
                        emplacement was located, underwater verification should be adequate for U.S.
                        to know what the Soviets are doing.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Wenk added that the last paragraph of the Deputies' Report on the
                        adequacy of U.S. verification capabilities must be read with its operating
                        phrase “in conjunction with” (“the current and projected strategic balance,
                        the limited relative advantage to the Soviet Union of clandestine
                        deployments of this kind on the seabed, and the political penalties attached
                        to the detection of such deployments”). The entire thought does not support
                        Gen. Wheeler's judgment. Moreover, the Soviets are retarded in deep sea
                        technology, and for the Soviets to develop such technology would be visible
                        to the intelligence community in the Ramp;D stage. The Soviet interest in
                        purchasing the Star III, for example, supports <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0649"/>this view since the technology represented in the Star III
                        as constructed is 8 or 10 years behind the current state of technology. </p>
                    <p>Adm. Taylor added that the basic question is the direction of Soviet
                        oceanographic interest—the evidence points to increasing Soviet capabilities
                        for fisheries resources.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that perhaps we
                        could attempt to cooperate with the Soviets in exploiting and exploring the
                        deep sea resources.</p>
                    <p>Adm. Taylor thought it was a good idea, adding that we could then check on
                        their technology.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> noted that without large
                        expenditures it would be a long time before deep sea capabilities would come
                        into being.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Wenk said that most of the existing U.S. deep submergence vehicles were
                        built by aerospace industries.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> the reason for his interest in
                        reserving the seabed for possible future nuclear weapons deployment. In view
                        of the Antarctica, <gloss target="#t_LTBT1">LTBT</gloss> and the Outer Space
                        treaties, an agreed restraint in this new environment would appear very
                        real.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said that the reason for
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>'s support of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT1">LTBT</gloss> was to avoid further contamination of the
                        atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> added that <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> support for the <gloss target="#t_LTBT1">LTBT</gloss> almost did not come to pass, and that the U.S. was paying
                        a penalty for ratifying the treaty in the constraints the U.S. had accepted.
                        The U.S. is performing underground tests at a much greater expense and delay
                        than if the tests were conducted in the atmosphere. As for the Antarctica
                        Treaty, no one wanted to fight over the Antarctic. It is easier to verify
                        compliance with the Outer Space Treaty than under this proposed treaty.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked if <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> was concerned for the immediate future or
                        for the naval officer of year 2000 who is going to be penalized for this
                        decision. Would a duration clause make a difference?</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> said it seemed that we
                        were giving up possible future strategic capabilities in return for a small
                        political gain. Further, this might be only the first step toward a
                        strategic straight jacket, particularly in view of U.S. verification
                        capabilities.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said we must consider
                        constraint in nuclear weapons. Was the U.S. sincere in seeking arms
                        limitations on nuclear weapons? This proposal is a thoroughly consistent
                        follow-up to Antarctica, <gloss target="#t_LTBT1">LTBT</gloss>, and Outer
                        Space Treaties. It is a logical next step, and not a minor political
                        advantage.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said the U.S. better
                        start finding some acceptable constraints. He wondered where we would come
                        out if we continued the arms race in offensive and defensive missiles. As
                        for the possibility of preprogrammed computerized missiles, there would be
                        no decisions left to make and it would make the human condition appalling
                        beyond description. <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0650"/>There exists a
                        real danger in having nuclear weapon systems: they may be beyond the control
                        of human intelligence.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> said he had no strong
                        feelings on the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal. He could
                        appreciate the problems of Gen. Wheeler and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>. He could also see the political advantages. If we
                        failed to give up an option, we could be doing ourselves a great deal of
                        harm. We must make progress and show that we are taking steps to control the
                        arms race. The <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> is in the U.S. interests.
                        There does exist a dilemma with respect to verification of the seabed
                        proposal. Perhaps this problem should be recognized for what it is and we
                        all agree that it is overweighed by the political advantages. Congressional
                        approval will be difficult to obtain. The proposal has not been presented as
                        well as would be required to avoid Congressional difficulties.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> said that Congress had
                        recently queried him three times on whether FOBS constituted a violation of
                        the Outer Space Treaty. There still exists grave doubt on this point in
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that there doesn't
                        exist that much difference in verification capabilities under the Outer
                        Space Treaty and the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal. It is
                        very difficult to determine if a particular object in orbit is carrying a
                        nuclear weapon.</p>
                    <p>Adm. Taylor said he disagreed with the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> on
                        U.S. verification capabilities. He thought the estimative judgment in the
                        Deputies' Report was supportable but was as strong a judgment as could be
                        made.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said the U.S. was faced
                        with a problem of what to tell the Soviets and others in June and July.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said we could announce at
                        the June 17 meeting our belief that restraints on the deployment of weapons
                        of mass destruction in the seabed environment are possible, and hopefully
                        discuss the matter in the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> in July or
                        August. If we do nothing we face difficult political problems.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>
                    <p>That the U.S. Government adopt the position that nuclear weapons and other
                        weapons of mass destruction shall not be emplaced on or within the ocean
                        seabed, and that it is prepared to enter into serious discussions in order
                        to achieve an appropriate international agreement in this area.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                    <p>The U.S. Government is strongly supporting international cooperative efforts
                        involving the ocean, including your most recent proposal on “An
                        International Decade of Ocean Exploration”. A positive arms control approach
                        to the seabed complements our current stated policies involving the ocean
                        and its resources. It is important in its own right by prohibiting weapons
                        of mass destruction in a new environment, will provide a means for fending
                        off less acceptable seabed arms control measures which have been suggested
                        by other nations, and could lead to further steps in controlling the
                        strategic arms race.</p>
                    <p>This position, if implemented, would prohibit the emplacement or fixing of
                        nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction on or in the seabed. It
                        would not prohibit any U.S. military systems in current <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> plans; the deployment of submarines and
                        necessary surveillance and detection systems would not be limited in any
                        way.</p>
                    <p>Verification problems of this position are similar to, but somewhat more
                        difficult than, those associated with the banning of weapons of mass
                        destruction in outer space. I believe that our verification capabilities are
                        adequate to protect U.S. security interests when considered in conjunction
                        with the current and projected overall strategic balance, the limited
                        relative advantage to the Soviet Union of limited clandestine deployments of
                        such weapons on the seabed, and the political penalties attached to the
                        detection of such deployments.</p>
                    <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0652"/>
                    <p>Your approval of the recommended position will permit the U.S. Government to
                        take a positive approach to arms control on the seabed at the meeting of the
                        U.N. Ad Hoc Committee on the Seabed opening June 17. It would serve as a
                        basis for subsequent discussions at the resumed session of the
                        Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Conference [Committee] in Geneva and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly.<note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">The Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee resumed meeting on July 18,

                    <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName>:</p>
                    <p>Your proposed draft memorandum from the Secretary of State to the President,
                        circulated on 4 June 1968, has been reviewed within the Department of
                            Defense.<note n="2" xml:id="d244fn2">See <ref target="#d243fn1">footnote
                                1, Document 243</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I believe it would be unwise to take a definite position on an arms control
                        proposal banning weapons of mass destruction until we have a clearer
                        determination of what kind of proposal, if any, is in the best interests of
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>Based on the discussions between Mr. Meeker and Rear Admiral Hearn, I believe
                        that a more acceptable formulation of <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>'s specific proposal would be:</p>
                    <p>“Each State Party to this Treaty undertakes not to emplace implant or fix
                        nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction on, within, or beneath
                        or to the seabed beyond 12 nautical miles from its coast and up to <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0653"/>the coast of any other State. A
                        narrow band along the coasts of each State will be exempt from the
                        provisions of this Treaty; the width of this band to be determined by
                        negotiation.”</p>
                    <p>This statement cures the most immediate problem the Department of Defense has
                        with respect to the legal aspects and affords better protection to various
                        operating options we may wish to exercise in our mobile seabased strategic
                        systems.</p>
                    <p>The most important issue to be decided by the President is whether or not the
                        support of arms control measures for the seabeds is in the best over-all
                        interests of the United States. I recommend that your proposed memorandum be
                        altered to emphasize this basic issue and that you append to it the attached
                        memorandum from the Secretary of Defense. This <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> memorandum outlines some of the considerations which the
                        President should have in mind before deciding this issue.</p>

                    <p>Issues Raised by the Committee of Principals on <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>'s Seabed Arms Control Proposal</p>
                    <p>At the recent meetings of the Committee of Principals on <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>'s proposal for arms control on the
                            seabed<note n="4" xml:id="d244fn4">See <ref target="#d238">Documents
                            238</ref> and <ref target="#d242">242</ref>.</note> there were four
                        areas in which the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff could
                        not reach agreement with the other members of the Committee. These issues
                        are set forth below for your information, together with the extent of
                        agreement and disagreement:</p>
                    <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0654"/>
                    <p>Issue 1. What is permitted and what is prohibited.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Agreed:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Intent of proposal is to ban emplacement or establishment of permanently
                        fixed weapons of mass destruction from seabeds.</p>
                    <p>2. The banning of fixed sea-based systems is the least harmful possibility
                        from a national security point of view.</p>

                        this time will not be the genesis of new and disturbing legal theories and
                        precedents affecting the ongoing development of other seabed legal and

                    <p>3. That we can reach an accommodation with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> with respect to a baseline from which the limits of

                        of seabed strategic weapon systems more attractive to the US than to the

                    <p>1. There is a high probability that we could detect the development of a
                        prohibited system before it became operational.</p>
                    <p>2. We could almost certainly detect large scale construction activity on the
                        seabed but to determine exactly what was being constructed is a difficult
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>3. It is unlikely that we could detect small scale deployments of some types
                        of prohibited systems but could probably detect large scale deployments of
                        these systems.</p>

                    <p>2. That the extent of our agreed verification capability is adequate to

                    <p>3. That the existing verification capability is capable of timely detection
                        of a treaty violation.</p>
                    <p>Concerns about the verification of a seabed arms control agreement lead the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff to believe that the adoption of a specific arms
                        control proposal at this time would not be in the national interest and has
                        a potential for grave harm.</p>

                    <p>On June 11, 1968, <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> wrote President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> requesting approval for the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 underground nuclear test program,
                        Bowline, consisting of 57 tests: 45 for weapons development and the
                        remaining 12 consisting of 6 Plowshare tests sponsored by the Atomic Energy
                        Commission and 6 weapons effect tests sponsored by the Department of
                        Defense. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Subject File, Nuclear

                        VII, Box 29)</p>
                    <p>On June 27, Rostow wrote a memorandum to the President informing him of
                            <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>'s June 11 letter, and
                        requesting the President's approval of Bowline. Bowline included one large
                        excavation test, Schooner, scheduled for execution in the second quarter.
                        However, Rostow advised that specific approval for it should be requested
                        under separate cover, well in advance of the expected firing date. In fact,
                        any large-yield test that “might cause domestic problems” was also to be
                        submitted for Presidential approval under separate requests. A checkmark
                        next to an approving line appeared on the source text which indicated
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> 's approval of
                        Bowline. (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>In a June 28 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>,
                        Rostow informed him that Bowline was approved “with the understanding that
                        specific Presidential approval must be obtained for all nuclear excavation
                        experiments, for all tests to be conducted outside the National Test Site,
                        and for all tests with yields of one megaton or more.” This memorandum also
                        granted approval for Bowline I, the first quarter test program which
                        consisted of 15 Atomic Energy Commission weapon development tests, 1
                        Plowshare experiment, Stoddard, and 2 Department of Defense weapon effects
                        tests. (Ibid.) A total of 10 tests, including Stoddard which was fired on
                        September 17, took place at the Nevada Test Site. (United States Nuclear
                        Tests, July 1945 Through September 1992, page 33)</p>
                    <p>Also on September 17, Seaborg wrote President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> a letter in which he requested the President's
                        permission to execute Bowline II, the second quarter underground test
                        program. Bowline II included 18 tests: 16 to demonstrate the performance,
                        reliability, and safety of prototype warheads, and 2 other tests that would
                        require specific execution authority under separate requests. These were
                        Schooner, the one Plowshare cratering experiment, and Benham, the Spartan
                        development event. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Subject File,

                    <p> Rostow wrote President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> a
                        memorandum, September 27, informing him of <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>'s September 17 letter on Bowline II. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s approval of Bowline II
                        is indicated by a checkmark on Rostow's memorandum. (Ibid.) The following
                        day, September 28, Rostow wrote <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> informing him that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had approved Bowline II with specific approval
                        withheld on Schooner and Benham. (Ibid.)</p>
                    <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0657"/>
                    <p>Specific request for Schooner was made in an October 16 letter from Seaborg
                        to Rostow. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Subject File, Nuclear
                        Testing-Plowshare Events, Vol. 3, Box 30) Objections arose, however, from
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> over Schooner's potential
                        to violate the Limited Test Ban Treaty. In a letter to Rostow, October 30,
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> wrote, “I cannot recommend
                        approval of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> request to execute the
                        nuclear cratering experiment Schooner, since it involves a very substantial
                        risk of causing radioactive debris to be present in Canada in amounts that
                        will be detected, publicized, and used to support charges that we have
                        deliberately violated the Limited Test Ban Treaty. Such charges would, among
                        other consequences, have a decidedly adverse impact on our efforts to secure
                        adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.” (Ibid.) On November 16, Rostow
                        wrote President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> a memorandum
                        which informed him of <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>'s
                        request to execute Schooner and of the support given to it by the Department
                        of Defense, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff, and the Bureau of the Budget. All agencies but <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>, Rostow wrote, recommended granting
                        approval to <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> to conduct
                        Schooner. Rostow himself advocated approval and the President agreed by
                        placing a checkmark on the approving line which appeared on Rostow's
                        memorandum. (Ibid.) Schooner was eventually fired on December 8, and Benham,
                        yet another Plowshare experiment, on December 19. In all, 17 Bowline II
                        tests were conducted at the Nevada Test Site. (United States Nuclear Tests,

                    <p>Frankly, the basic issue we must face is how we avoid a bloody nose in
                        handling the Soviet initiative in New York. While I recognize that there is
                        merit in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>'s position, I doubt that it is
                        wise from a public relations point of view. Our failure to advance any
                        proposal will clearly not inhibit other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        delegations from making proposals. Ambassador Malik in New York has informed
                        our delegation that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will press for
                        a complete demilitarization of the ocean floor when he makes the Soviet
                        speech later this week. If we have no affirmative and reasonable proposal of
                        our own to put forward, we run the risk of being isolated by the Soviet
                        tactic. In addition, we run the risk that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Ad Hoc Committee may adopt the Soviet proposal or something like
                        it. I think you will agree that the latter result would be far less
                        acceptable from your point of view than what we have here suggested. By
                        putting forward a sound proposal of our own, we at least have some chance of
                        directing the debate along lines that would produce an outcome we could live
                        with.</p>
                    <p>Since this is likely to be a luncheon topic tomorrow, I would appreciate your

                        pursuant to which each party would agree not to emplace or fix nuclear
                        weapons or other weapons of mass destruction on, within, beneath or to the
                        seabed beyond a narrow band along its coast and up to the coast of any other
                        State. The width of this narrow band would be determined by negotiation. The
                        prohibition on emplacement or fixing should be aimed not only at the weapons
                        themselves but also at launching platforms or delivery systems for such
                        weapons, and should be subject to appropriate means of verification.”</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>We have in mind your messages of January 22<note n="2" xml:id="d247fn2">Not
                            printed. (Ibid., Vol. II, Box 11)</note> and May 2<note n="3" xml:id="d247fn3">See <ref target="#d237">Document 237</ref>.</note> of
                        this year in which you spoke out in favor of reaching an understanding on
                        questions concerning restraint in the strategic arms race.</p>
                    <p>As we informed you earlier we for our part also attach great importance to
                        these questions, having in mind that they should be considered together,
                        systems for delivery of offensive strategic nuclear weapons as well as
                        systems for defense against ballistic missiles.</p>
                    <p>All aspects of this complex problem are now being carefully examined by us,
                        and we hope that before long it will be possible more concretely to exchange
                        views with regard to further ways of discussing this problem, if of course
                        the general world situation does not hinder this.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>I was greatly encouraged by your letter on strategic arms talks, which was
                        delivered by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on
                        June 21.<note n="2" xml:id="d248fn2">

                    <p>As you know, the non-proliferation treaty, on which our representatives have
                        worked so hard and so well in Geneva and New York, will be opened for
                        signature in our two capitals as well as in London on July 1. I think it
                        would be particularly fitting if, on that date, we could jointly announce
                        our agreement to hold talks on the strategic missile problem. I believe this
                        would do much to advance our common aim of achieving the widest possible
                        endorsement of the treaty.</p>
                    <p>I look forward to further work from you when you have completed your
                        deliberations in Moscow.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>My colleagues and I have carefully considered your letter of June 22,

                        strategic offensive and defensive nuclear weapons delivery systems. We are
                        prepared to publish in the Soviet press and over the radio on July 1 the
                        following statement of the Soviet Government:</p>
                    <p>“On the forthcoming talks on questions of curbing the strategic arms race.</p>
                    <p>“An agreement has been reached between the Government of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> to enter in the nearest future into talks on limitation and

                        systems of defense against ballistic missiles.”</p>
                    <p>We have no doubt that a statement in such a spirit made by our Governments
                        should, undoubtedly, also further the task of inducing the adherence of the
                        greatest number of states to the non-proliferation treaty.</p>

                        also announced: “Agreement has been reached between the Governments of the

                        nearest future into discussions on the limitation and the reduction of both
                        offensive strategic nuclear weapons delivery systems and systems of defense

                        transmitted the treaty to the Senate. His accompanying message urged “that

                        Because of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August and preoccupation
                        with the Presidential election campaign, however, full Senate action on the
                        treaty was delayed until the incoming Nixon administration.</p>
                    <p>The Senate gave its consent to the agreement on March 13, 1969, by a vote of
                        83-15, and the treaty, which required the ratification of the United <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0662"/>States, the United Kingdom, Soviet
                        Union, and 40 other states, finally entered into force with the deposit of
                        U.S. ratification at Washington, London, and Moscow on March 5, 1970. For

                    <p>For several years the United States has been proposing in Geneva that the
                        nuclear-weapons powers agree to halt the production of fissionable material
                        for nuclear weapons. Since agreement on this proposal would clearly be in
                        the U.S. net interest, we expect to propose it again at the forthcoming
                            <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> session this summer. The purpose
                        of this memorandum is to propose updating one aspect of the verification
                        arrangements for a cutoff treaty.</p>
                    <p>The other aspects of the U.S. position on this measure would remain as we
                        have previously described them in Geneva. The plants engaged in <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0663"/>production of enriched uranium or plutonium
                        for use in nuclear weapons would either be shut down or their product would
                        be utilized for purposes other than nuclear weapons. Each country would
                        provide a list of all its nuclear facilities to the International Atomic
                        Energy Agency (<gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>) and permit the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> to apply safeguards to ascertain that
                        none of the produced fissionable material was being used for nuclear
                        weapons. This would involve a major opening up of the Soviet nuclear energy
                        program to international inspection.</p>
                    <p>When the United States described this proposal to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> four years ago, we dealt with the
                        possibility of undeclared production facilities by stating, “There would be
                        agreed rights to conduct a limited number of inspections of suspected
                        undeclared facilities on an adversary basis.”<note n="2" xml:id="d251fn2">

                        our current unilateral capabilities in this field, I recommend that we
                        withdraw this 1964 formulation, and rely instead on our unilateral
                        capabilities to verify that other parties to the treaty are not operating
                        significant undeclared nuclear material production facilities. My reasons
                        for this recommendation are as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. The U.S. has high confidence that it has identified all current Soviet
                        fissionable material production facilities which are capable of making a
                        significant addition to the already large existing Soviet weapons stockpile.</p>
                    <p>2. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>3. [<hi rend="italic">6 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>4. Such elimination would remove a potentially troublesome discrepancy
                        between the verification arrangements we would be willing to accept for a
                        cutoff and those we have asked other countries to accept under the
                        non-proliferation treaty. It is difficult to justify treaty rights to search
                        for undeclared plants in a country which already has large stockpiles of
                        fissionable materials, when the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> does not
                        set forth such rights for nations in which a small clandestine plant might
                        be significant.</p>

                        arrangements will be found at Tab A.</p>

                        in our net interest, and has reaffirmed this proposal on frequent occasions
                        since that time. The relevant factors have recently been reviewed to
                        determine whether that conclusion still obtains, and we have found that it
                        does. The results of these studies are summarized at Tab B.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, I recommend for your consideration that when we next propose the

                    <p>The proposed modification in the U.S. position relates only to verification
                        for undeclared plants. No change is proposed in the procedures the U.S. has

                    <p>The United States has proposed that the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        would apply safeguards in order to verify compliance with the obligations of
                        the cutoff treaty. These safeguards would be similar to those applied under
                        the non-proliferation treaty. The <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        would safeguard not only nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities,
                        but also the fissionable material in every other peaceful nuclear facility
                        in each country, in order to ascertain that no fissionable materials
                        produced was being used for nuclear weapons purposes.</p>
                    <p>While the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> has not yet developed
                        detailed procedures for safeguarding either uranium enrichment facilities or
                        shutdown reactors, U.S. and U.K. studies have been made which can provide a
                        basis for <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards techniques for
                        such plants. These techniques would be effective in detecting any
                        significant Soviet diversion of fissionable material to weapons use.</p>

                    <p>During the last session of the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>, several

                        acceptance would not be relevant to the proliferation problem. While the
                        U.S.S.R. has always resisted proposals for inspection on its own territory,
                        the Soviets may find it difficult to explain why they are unwilling to
                        accept relevant inspection for the cutoff proposal when the inspection is
                        essentially the same as the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards

                    <p>To verify that other parties to the treaty are not operating significant
                        undeclared nuclear material production facilities, each party would rely on
                        unilateral capabilities. [<hi rend="italic">7-½ lines of source text not

                    <p>Since the Soviets would realize that any significant violation would run a
                        very high risk of detection, they can be expected to refrain from violations
                        as long as they want the treaty to continue in force. If the Soviets wanted
                        to terminate the treaty, they probably would find it preferable to do so by
                        use of a treaty withdrawal clause, rather than by risking the onus of being
                        caught in a violation.</p>
                    <p>An early test of Soviet good-faith compliance with the treaty would be their
                        initial declaration listing their nuclear facilities. If this initial
                        declaration is complete, and coincides with U.S. present highly reliable
                        information on this subject, and the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        is permitted to safeguard freely all such Soviet nuclear facilities, it
                        would seem quite unlikely that the Soviets would then attempt to build a new
                        series of clandestine nuclear plants which involve no shipments to or from
                        any of their declared, inspected facilities. If they did build such plants
                        which would add significantly to their already large stockpile, the U.S.
                        would have a very high probability of detecting such a violation.</p>

                    <p>A Soviet refusal to permit such a non-intrusive inspection would provide a

                        of the U.S.S.R. having already accepted extensive inspection of its nuclear

                        CUTOFF OF PRODUCTION OF FISSIONABLE MATERIALS FOR WEAPONS USES</p>
                    <p>The U.S. has proposed many times at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>
                        that the nuclear-weapon states halt all production of fissionable material
                        for use in nuclear weapons, and that the U.S. and U.S.S.R. transfer from
                        their weapons stockpiles to peaceful uses agreed amounts of uranium-235 and
                        plutonium. We have said that the U.S. would so transfer 60,000 kg of
                        uranium-235 if the U.S.S.R. would transfer 40,000 kg. We have suggested that
                        this transferred uranium could be obtained by demonstrated destruction of
                        nuclear weapons, and that we would transfer to peaceful uses the associated
                        plutonium from these weapons in amounts to be negotiated with the U.S.S.R.
                        in advance. This combined proposal will be referred to below as the
                        “cutoff-transfer” proposal.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Impact on U.S. Strategic Posture</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. U.S. Military Requirements</p>
                    <p>The U.S. has recently concluded that our military requirements for plutonium
                        can be met by operation of four production reactors at Richland. We have
                        already shut down five plutonium production reactors at this site. Presently
                        planned nuclear weapons requirements can be met from the uranium-235 and
                        plutonium on hand. (This includes weapons in stockpile awaiting retirement
                        and materials in the pipeline.) Reactor development and research are
                        absorbing most of the current plutonium production at Richland. A small
                        amount of plutonium metal is being stockpiled to meet contingency plans.
                        (Three reactors at Savannah River are being used principally for production
                        of tritium. Two similar reactors there have been shut down.)</p>
                    <p>Based on current plans, U.S. weapons requirements for the mid-1970's can be
                        met from fissionable materials on hand now. Even with a transfer of 60,000
                        kg of uranium and agreed amounts of associated plutonium from destroyed
                        weapons to peaceful uses, all strategic U.S. military requirements for the
                        near future can be met from existing stocks.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Soviet Military Requirements</p>
                    <p>It appears that the Soviets could meet their priority strategic requirements
                        from existing stocks, even with a transfer of [<hi rend="italic">1-½ lines
                            of source text not declassified</hi>] from destroyed weapons to peaceful
                        uses. However, they would not have enough fissionable material to <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s and deploy an extensive <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>

                    <p>Recent studies have shown that the earlier a cutoff-transfer measure is
                        implemented, the more it would be to the advantage of the U.S. Such an
                        agreement would be to our advantage now and would remain so until about
                        1976. Following 1976, the proposed measures would not present a significant
                        military advantage to either country. By that time, both the U.S.S.R. and
                        the U.S. would have accumulated such large stockpiles of fissionable
                        materials that any cutoff of production for weapons uses would be of little
                        military significance.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (10 lines of source text) not
                        declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>A cutoff in 1968 to 1970 would slow down the accumulation of fissionable
                        materials by both countries but would be more advantageous to the U.S. A
                        cutoff in 1972 or later would have only a small effect on the accumulation
                        of that amount of fissionable materials calculated to be necessary for both
                        U.S. and U.S.S.R. top priority and second priority military requirements. A
                        cutoff in 1976 or after would appear to have no direct military effect,
                        because the availability of fissionable materials for military uses will be
                        more than any predicted requirements can utilize.</p>

                    <p>When the U.S. first offered in September 1965 to obtain the 60,000 kg of
                        uranium-235 for transfer from demonstrated destruction of nuclear weapons,
                        it was determined that this could be done [<hi rend="italic">2-½ lines of

                    <p>Tritium was dealt with in the U.S. cutoff-transfer position paper of February
                        15, 1966, along the lines outlined below. There have been no developments
                        since then which call for changing this position.</p>
                    <p>Since tritium is not a fissionable material, it has not been covered in our
                        past cutoff proposals, and we do not plan to initiate any discussion of
                        tritium. (Of course, nuclear reactors, including tritium production
                        reactors, would be subject to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards under a cutoff agreement.) If the U.S.S.R. should urge limitation

                        following contingency guidance:</p>
                    <p>If progress in negotiations warrants it, the Delegation may request approval
                        to discuss tritium production limitations with the U.S.S.R. However, the
                        disposition of tritium from weapons submitted for destruction should not be
                        discussed.</p>
                    <p>It is the U.S. position that enough production of tritium should continue
                        under a cutoff to compensate for the radioactive decay of the tritium in the
                        weapons inventory and the stockpile, and to provide for non-weapons uses.
                        Uranium-235 required to fuel reactors for producing tritium for weapons
                        replenishment would be obtained from existing stockpiles.</p>
                    <p>A possible limitation on the amount of allowed production of tritium might be
                        obtained by requiring that equivalent amounts of <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0668"/>helium-3 be turned in. Results of an <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> study have shown that the decay of tritium
                        is the only practical source of significant quantities of helium-3. However,
                        tritium production rates are highly classified at this time and
                        declassification would be necessary before any discussions that would reveal
                        these rates could take place.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Political Considerations Regarding Cutoff-Transfer
                        Proposal</p>
                    <p>Pressures from the non-nuclear-weapon countries for concrete measures of
                        armaments reduction by the nuclear-weapon powers are likely to increase,
                        particularly during the period when the non-proliferation treaty (<gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>) has been signed but not yet ratified by
                        many countries. Key non-nuclear-weapon states will probably demand that the
                        nuclear powers make progress toward disarmament by agreeing to measures that
                        would constitute a “balance of obligations.” While the non-nuclear-weapon
                        nations will be serving their own interests by accession to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, they will nevertheless strongly urge that
                        the nuclear-weapon powers also contribute to the stability of the
                        international scene and take steps to reduce the likelihood of a future
                        nuclear conflict. It is likely that some non-nuclear-weapon states will
                        attempt to make such steps by the nuclear-weapon powers a condition for
                        their signature, ratification, or continued adherence to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>One measure that the non-nuclear-weapon states have suggested as contributing
                        to a suitable balance of obligations and which the United States has already
                        proposed is a complete cessation of the production of fissionable materials
                        for weapons uses. The destruction of a number of nuclear weapons and the
                        transfer of the resulting fissionable materials to peaceful uses is a
                        related measure which the U.S. has also proposed at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>. These measures would constitute a
                        logical post-<gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> approach by the
                        nuclear-weapon powers to a “balance of obligations.”</p>

                    <p rend="center">SUMMARY OF ACTIONS</p>
                    <p>1. A Working Group, composed of senior representatives of each of the
                        agencies represented on the Executive Committee and chaired by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>, was established to develop positions and issues for
                        consideration of the Executive Committee.</p>
                    <p>2. The Department of Defense was asked to draft a substantive opening
                        statement which could be considered by the Working Group along with the
                        draft opening statement already distributed to the Executive Committee.</p>
                    <p>3. In drafting the opening statement, consideration should be given to the
                        possibility of consulting on the completed statement with Congress, but no
                        consideration should be given to release to the press. In the meantime,
                        answers to Congressional queries should be limited to statements that no
                        date and place have yet been selected and that we are studying the
                        substantive problems involved.</p>
                    <p>4. The Committee endorsed the <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss> action to
                        prepare an updated <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> on U.S.
                        capabilities to verify various strategic arms control measures.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> opened the meeting by
                        pointing out that the President had worked hard over a period of eighteen
                        months to get the Soviets to agree to discussions on controlling the
                        strategic arms race. He was concerned that the race would spiral to new
                        plateaus with even greater <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0670"/>expenditures without any increase in security. All agreed that the
                        problems were very complex and that the difficulties of achieving a
                        successful agreement should not be underestimated. However, it was the job
                        of the Committee to translate this general policy into specific proposals
                        for controlling the arms race. We had no indications from the Soviets as to
                        the time and place, but they had urged the discussions be held in the
                        nearest future. He pointed out that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> would be returning to Geneva on Thursday,<note n="4" xml:id="d252fn4">July 11.</note> but he need not get into this question
                        in his discussions with <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName>.</p>
                    <p>He believed that the Government needed some special machinery to develop the
                        U.S. position for these discussions and the present Executive Committee of
                        Principals was established for this purpose. He also circulated an
                        organizational paper, which had been previously coordinated informally.<note n="5" xml:id="d252fn5">Reference apparently is to an unsigned procedural
                            memorandum, July 8, which described the creation of a special
                            interagency committee, with <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> as
                            chair, to prepare for the upcoming talks with the Soviet Union on the
                            limitation and reduction of offensive and defensive strategic missile
                            systems. The procedural memorandum included Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s request that it should be
                            circulated to all officers and agencies concerned with these
                            discussions. (Department of State, Central Files, DEF 18)</note> This
                        paper established an inter-agency working group under the Chairmanship of
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>, to develop U.S. positions and issues for consideration by
                        the Executive Committee.</p>
                    <p>He stated that he had studied the draft Opening Statement (See Reference) and
                        had no particular problems with it although he would welcome a few word
                        changes. For example, he believed the term, “unacceptable damage,” might be
                        altered.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> said he had studied
                        the State-<gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> draft opening statement and
                        position paper together with the analysis of the position paper that had
                        been prepared in the Department of Defense. He thought these were useful
                        first efforts but that it was too early to proceed further with substantive
                        positions, as in the draft opening statement. He believed that the
                        discussion should start on a very general plane without any concrete
                        proposals or U.S. concessions, since the Soviets would take these as agreed
                        to begin with and move on to obtain further concessions. He thought the
                        first sessions would be primarily administrative in nature in which we would
                        have an opportunity to test the sincerity of Soviet intentions. He thought
                        it was important to determine what the Soviets wished to accomplish as a
                        result of these discussions.</p>
                    <p>He considered verification to be the most important problem since he was
                        worried about the Soviet attitude in this area. He wished to test them out
                        and was not sure that we should depend on unilateral verification except as
                        a fall-back. The discussions should be approached very carefully to assure
                        that national security would not be jeopardized. He <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0671"/>was reluctant to start with the position
                        which should be reserved until the generalities had been thoroughly
                        discussed.</p>
                    <p>Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> emphasized that
                        we must understand all the facts on any positions before they are adopted.
                        For example, the proposal to freeze land-based <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s was, in fact, a freezing of the launch holes. Since the
                        Soviet holes are larger than the U.S. holes, they could exploit these to
                        Soviet advantage. He thought that even though the verification might be
                        difficult, throw weight might be a better criteria for control than
                        launchers. One must assume that in time the U.S. would lose its
                        technological advantage. It was important that we obtain fact sheets on each
                        issue as had been done with the test ban.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> also emphasized the
                        importance of the verification problem. He thought we should determine what
                        are the critical parameters in missile capabilities and agreed that throw
                        weight was important. He recommended that the Working Group list each issue
                        which would become the subject of a separate paper since lumping all issues
                        together often confused them.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> pointed out that the
                        draft opening statement was intended to be the first substantive
                        presentation, since the administrative arrangements could be handled without
                        difficulty. Since the U.S. had been pressing the Soviets for talks for
                        eighteen months, it was logical for them to expect us to state what we had
                        in mind early in the negotiations. He expected some sparring, and we might
                        get some very unrealistic suggestions related to complete disarmament or the
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> Proposal. He agreed that
                        any U.S. proposals must be in the security interests, but he did not feel we
                        would be moving into the area of insecurity by the talks. Rather, a failure
                        to control the arms race would decrease security. He was not sure what the
                        Soviets wanted out of the discussions; at best, they might have reached that
                        conclusion that a new plateau with great expenditures without changing the
                        net security situation should be avoided. In the worst case, they might hope
                        that these talks would be demonstrations to the non-nuclear countries of
                        their desire to halt the arms race but have no hope of agreement. They might
                        make far-reaching proposals which might be attractive to the non-nuclear
                        countries and would cause U.S. propaganda difficulties. Obviously, both
                        sides would be seeking advantages from the talks.</p>
                    <p>Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> stated that
                        hopefully we might find a position in which both sides gain, but the
                        difficulty would be that each side hoped to make relative gains.</p>
                    <p>Deputy Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> believed
                        that there was undoubtedly opposition in the Soviet Union to the talks, but
                        they may have been worried about increasing expenditures for new strategic
                        systems. The Soviets may also have been motivated to counteract the U.S.
                        offer for talks to improve their image in the context of Article VI of the
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty. <pb n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0672"/>He was
                        struck by the association of these talks to the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> Nine Points for the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> which had many of the standard arms control proposals;<note n="6" xml:id="d252fn6">Reference presumably is to the nine-part Soviet

                        of the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> indicated that it would be possible
                        to have private talks in Geneva; all the other nations had plenty of
                        experience with U.S.-Soviet private discussions at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> and would undoubtedly take it in their

                        might consider attempting to get the Soviets to agree to inspections. While
                        they had always been adamant against these, the Soviet requirements for
                        secrecy no longer made sense and their attitudes might be different now.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agreed that
                        verification was a key problem since we must have confidence that any
                        agreement would not adversely affect our security.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> stated that <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss> was in the process of updating <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 11-10-67<note n="7" xml:id="d252fn7">See
                                <ref target="#d253fn5">footnote 5, Document 253</ref>.</note> at
                        General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>'s request and hoped
                        to consider it by July 18. He did not believe that the conclusions would
                        change, but it would be useful to make sure that it was still current. He
                        urged that in developing U.S. position papers, all groups use common
                        intelligence estimates in order to avoid unnecessary discrepancies in the
                        studies and indicated that Mr. Bruce Clarke, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, would be the central point for providing such information.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> indicated that studies on
                        methods of controlling the strategic arms race had been going on for seven
                        years; that we had accumulated large amounts of information which would
                        provide a good basis for developing the U.S. positions and support for the
                        discussions. He pointed out that we have already told the Soviets, with the
                        President's approval, that the U.S. was prepared to consider using
                        unilateral sources insofar as possible to verify any agreement and that it
                        would be hard to backtrack from this position. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> indicated that unilateral information
                        might be satisfactory for limiting the strategic arms race, but might not be
                        for reductions. He indicated that if the verification problems could be
                        solved, he might be in favor of the Baruch Plan since he thought it would be
                        desirable to scrap all nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> suggested that one might
                        agree on the basic principles to be accomplished in controlling the arms
                        race before one got down to specifics. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> indicated that we need something like the draft opening
                        statement which dealt with the substance and suggested that Department of
                        Defense representatives try their hand at another draft. <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0673"/>How it was actually used might depend on
                        how the discussions develop. He thought Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> should act as if he were the chief
                        negotiator in Moscow and the Soviets asked him what he was proposing.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> indicated that
                        Department of Defense would undertake such a draft which could be forwarded
                        to the Working Group for consideration along with the present draft.</p>
                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> said he had only a
                        limited time to study the papers but they left no doubt on the principles
                        involved. He understood that the proposals did not include the controls on
                        the development of the front end technology and particularly nuclear
                        warheads.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested that the
                        Soviets might bring up the question of <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s immediately. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> said he still had a job to do, such as warheads for
                        Spartan. He agreed that we should have a substantive position for initiating
                        the talks, but that perhaps we might hold back on the unilateral
                        verification. Deputy Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> thought we should initially hold back on national systems
                        and that the statements on Page 5 of the draft opening statement went too
                        far. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> referred to the
                        presentation (State 158191, March 18, 1967) made to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> on March 28, 1967,<note n="8" xml:id="d252fn8">See <ref target="#d192">Document 192</ref>. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>'s presentation on
                            March 28, 1967, has not been further identified.</note> which was
                        essentially identical with that in the opening statement. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> indicated that we should rely
                        on national means for what they were capable of verifying. He was pleased
                        that <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss> was updating the <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>. For items which could not be adequately
                        verified by national means, we would have to negotiate other verification
                        arrangements.</p>
                    <p>In summary, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> directed the
                        Working Group to start immediately developing a position with the necessary
                        back-up studies. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>
                        indicated that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC2">Warnke</persName> would head
                        the Department of Defense working team and be their representative on the
                        working group. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked
                        the Department of Defense to draft another opening statement to be
                        considered by the working group along with the present one.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> asked guidance on the
                        Congressional consultation. He suggested that for the present we should say
                        that no time or place had been agreed upon and that we are still studying
                        the nature of the U.S. position. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> hoped that the dates would not be announced for the next
                        few days until the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> was out of the way.
                        One should consider in drafting the opening statement the possibility of
                        consulting with the Congress on it, but he did not believe it would be
                        desirable to make this statement available to the press since the subject
                        was much too complicated at this stage. He stated he had seen too many
                        occasions where we allowed details to block major U.S. policy objectives. He
                        cursed the day when the Baruch proposal was turned down.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Schedule for Preparation</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> said although no specific
                        time for the talks appears yet to have been set, we must, for planning
                        purposes, assume that the U.S. should be ready by the middle of August. He
                        also said that when the President returns on July 21<note n="2" xml:id="d253fn2">President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was in Honolulu for talks with President Thieu of
                            South Vietnam July 18-20.</note> he will undoubtedly want to have a
                        report on where we are in our preparations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMH2">Halperin</persName> said that it would be better if we could have until
                        the end of August to complete our preparations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> hoped we could have the
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                        re-write the opening statement by the first of next week. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMH2">Halperin</persName> said they would try to get the
                        opening statement by some time early next week. He said they could get the
                        first part of it—dealing with principles and introductory material—to us by
                        then but it was difficult to get the section dealing with a specific
                        proposal agreed in the Pentagon until the basic position had been agreed
                        upon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> said we would have
                        to have a specific proposal when we start talking with the Soviets. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> noted we had already told
                        them we would have a specific proposal when the talks start. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJP2">Shaw</persName>
                        <note n="3" xml:id="d253fn3">Probably <persName corresp="#p_SJP2">John

                        been some misunderstanding regarding the message containing the later
                        commitment and that <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> thought we would say
                        we expected both sides to have proposals.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMH2">Halperin</persName> said <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> would go on working on the specific
                        proposal but would send around the first part of the opening statement so
                        that the Working Group could get at that part at an early date.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> said if we were to have a
                        position approved by the President by August 15th, the Working Group would
                        have to have issues and recommendations before the Principals by around the
                        2nd or 3rd of August. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMH2">Halperin</persName>
                        thought it would take four weeks for <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> to have a suggested basic position
                        for consideration by the Working <pb n="639" xml:id="pg_639" facs="0675"/>Group. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KSMJ1">Keeny</persName> said such a schedule would not fit the need to have an
                        agreed position by August 15. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KSMJ1">Keeny</persName> said we could not go to the President for a decision two
                        or three days before the 15th since this would give him no time for any
                        Congressional consultation.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed by General Evans and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMH2">Halperin</persName> that we should try to have a position ready by August
                        15.</p>

                    <p>It was noted that <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 11-13-68,<note n="4" xml:id="d253fn4">
                            <ref target="#d257">Document 257</ref>.</note> which will replace <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 11-10-67<note n="5" xml:id="d253fn5">“U.S. Capabilities to Monitor Certain Limitations on Strategic Weapons

                        capabilities, will be ready July 18.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> thought we should somehow
                        find a way for the U.S. Delegation to probe the Soviets to see what we could
                        get from them on on-site inspection. He and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> thought the U.S. had clearly implied in previous
                        communications with the Soviets that national capabilities would be
                        sufficient for fixed installations, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> thought we had also indicated that mobile systems would
                        have to have on-site inspection, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Scoville</persName>
                        said this decision had not been taken. General Allison said the Joint Chiefs
                        of Staff felt that the earlier reference to “maximum reliance” on national
                        capabilities left open the question of whether on-site inspection might be
                        necessary even for fixed installations.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed, however, that the verification question should be addressed
                        after we receive <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 11-13-68, although
                        preliminary work could be started on the assumption, reinforced by the
                        remarks of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clark</persName> of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, that the new <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> would not make major changes from <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 11-10-67.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the verification question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMH2">Halperin</persName> said we should soon begin to address the question
                        of what we say publicly and to members of Congress with respect to our
                        existing national capabilities and suggested that the <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> Committee should address this
                        question. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJP2">Shaw</persName> felt we should
                        wait awhile on this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMH2">Halperin</persName> did
                        not agree. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clark</persName> pointed out that
                        the Director of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has a statutory
                        responsibility in this area which presents some problems unless a new look
                        is taken at what we say about national capabilities. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> agreed that we should for the moment
                        wait until we see how our position is developing before we address the
                        question of some new decision by the <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> Committee.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMH2">Halperin</persName> said we needed to look at
                        what we would do with any Soviet agreement to permit some kind of on-site
                        inspection. He said we <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0676"/>need to know
                        what kinds we would want if we could get on-site inspection and we need to
                        look at the kind we might be offered by the Soviets. It was agreed that
                            <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> would do a paper on this subject.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJP2">Shaw</persName> said he had an input for
                        such a paper concerning the negotiating problems on raising on-site
                        inspection. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> agreed to have
                        a working group look at this question, but did not want to give it priority
                        over other issues that the Working Group has to address.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMH2">Halperin</persName> said one issue on
                        verification we should be thinking about was what understanding we should
                        have with the Soviets concerning the continuation of the capabilities for
                        national verification; he said clearly we should have an understanding that
                        neither side would interfere with certain existing national capabilities,
                        and perhaps we should also have some form of understanding—though he
                        recognized this was more difficult—that neither side would attempt to
                        conceal what they are now not concealing. It was agreed the Working Group
                        should give further thought to this issue.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Additional Studies</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> raised the question of
                        additional studies or papers that the Working Group should have underway. He
                        said <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> would do a contingency paper on
                        how we handled a Soviet “<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>

                        evaluating verification capabilities, is being up-dated.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMH2">Halperin</persName> said <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> was doing a military analysis paper. He
                        said he hoped to circulate soon an uncleared version of this paper.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that with respect to allied consultations we would have to
                        prepare a cable to <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss> for the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Meeting of July 15, in which <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0677"/>we would give Cleveland guidance that would
                        indicate to him that he could not expect to treat the strategic talks as we
                        had the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> as far as consultations were
                        concerned. State and <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> were to draft
                        this message.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMH2">Halperin</persName> said <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> wanted a study on what the Soviet military
                        posture is likely to be, assuming an agreement of the State-<gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> type. He said this study should address
                        what the Soviets are technically capable of doing within the framework of a
                            State-<gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> type of agreement and also
                        what they are likely to do. He said this would be complementary to a study
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> is doing of what they would be
                        likely to do without an agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJP2">Shaw</persName> said this would have to be balanced by an assessment of
                        what the U.S. could also do, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMH2">Halperin</persName> said this part would be done by <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> as part of its analysis.</p>
                    <p>(Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMH2">Halperin</persName> mentioned in the course
                        of the discussion that <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>'s thinking was
                        that the agreement would have to prevent silo hardening rather than attempt
                        to prevent increase in the size of holes since it would be most difficult to
                        determine whether holes were increased in size if construction for hardening
                        was taking place.)</p>
                    <p>With respect to the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> suggested study, Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Scoville</persName> said the technical facts
                        would not be difficult to assemble and could be done very quickly but that
                        the basic question of a judgment on what the Soviets would do with technical
                        capability would be the critical issue and might take more time. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clark</persName> agreed to prepare terms of
                        reference and consult with other members of the group on them and to aim at
                        a target date of August 1 for the paper.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMH2">Halperin</persName> said the Working Group
                        should also be thinking about what our position should be if, after a period
                        of time, the ChiComs continued their strategic buildup; he said clearly we
                        would not want to continue a Soviet-U.S. agreement indefinitely without
                        modification in this event, and that we should provide in some way in the
                        agreement for an understanding to this effect. It was agreed further thought
                        should be given to this point.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJP2">Shaw</persName> said that while we are
                        waiting for <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> views on the basic position paper we ought to be reviewing it
                        to see if any “corrections” need to be made of a factual nature. Mr. Clarke
                        said there were some more recent figures that should be incorporated in the
                        paper and he would be in touch with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Scoville</persName>.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other Matters</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> raised the question of the
                        impending initiation of <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> testing in
                        August and said this might well coincide with the opening of the strategic
                        talks. He said he felt that these tests should be postponed. He said that as
                        a minimum they should not be publicized in the manner presently
                        contemplated. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMH2">Halperin</persName> noted that

                        been cleared in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> said we ought to look at this

                        1968</date>.</dateline>
                    <p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>I gather that among other uncertainties about strategic arms limitation talks
                        with the Russians, the question is still open as to just how our bilateral
                        negotiations will be related in practice to the consultative machinery of
                        the North Atlantic Council. Since it is a special responsibility of mine to
                        try to think hard about this, I want to set down for your consideration my
                        thoughts on this matter as you prepare our national position on what may
                        turn out to be an historic undertaking.</p>
                    <p>My net conclusion is that we can manage to meet our commitments to allied
                        consultation in a way which avoids either interfering with the inherently
                        bilateral character of direct negotiations or appearing to play loose with
                        our allies. To put it the other way around, our interests and the interests
                        of our allies in this affair can be reconciled handily in practice.</p>
                    <p>As to the interests of our allies, it is already clear from concerned
                        conversations which my colleagues here have opened up with me that they are
                        in no doubt whatever that when we negotiate with the Russians about the
                        western half of the nuclear deterrent, we are negotiating about their vital
                        national interests as well as our own. The dependence of our non-nuclear
                        allies on our nuclear arsenal has just been copper-bottomed by the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>; and their sense of involvement in our
                        negotiations about <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0679"/>nuclear missiles
                        can only become more acute as the implications of this enterprise become
                        more clear.</p>
                    <p>As for our own interests, we have the positive one of continuing to nourish
                        western unity and the negative one of avoiding the kind of divisive and
                        potentially ruinous hassle we had over the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. With a lot of hard work and very late in the day, a dangerous
                        drift on the military side of nuclear affairs was reversed by establishing
                        the Nuclear Planning Group; now, we have to tackle just as creatively the
                        parallel problem on the arms control side of nuclear affairs. And surely it
                        is deeply important to us—in domestic political, as well as foreign policy
                        terms—to choke off that irrational but just-beneath-the-surface possibility
                        that the European politicians and press would feel inspired to revive the
                        specter of “nuclear complicity” by the “Soviet-American condominium.”</p>
                    <p>Our proper course in these circumstances, it seems to me, is really quite
                        simple. Consultations in the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> must of
                        course be geared to progress, or lack of it, in the bilateral channel. But
                        it is easy enough to foresee an opening phase which I should think would
                        take us through the summer and into the early fall. In this phase, our role
                        in the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> should be to explain the
                        background, the environment, and the political and technical context,
                        without the need to predict substantive US positions before we are clear
                        about them ourselves.</p>
                    <p>I already have speculated in the Council, along the lines of an <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> analysis, about what may have inspired the
                        Soviets to answer their mail on this subject at this moment of time. By
                        inviting the speculations of others on the same subject, we have opened a
                        “consultation” with no conceivable damage that I can imagine to US
                        interests. On the other hand, I can well imagine spinning out this manner of
                        consulting within the Alliance over the period it may take the US Government
                        to pull itself together internally.</p>
                    <p>At a second, later stage (say, early fall) I can imagine our floating some
                        general propositions as a basis for <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                        discussion. Surely we could, without danger to our own position, invite
                        discussion of the kinds of rather bland “principles” we wrote into the
                        Reykjavik Declaration on Mutual Force Reductions.</p>
                    <p>At a still later stage it might help to induce a more pervasive sense of
                        “participation” if the <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_NDAC1">NDAC</gloss> machinery were brought into play—not in
                        direct relation to any specific aspect of the bilateral talks, but to review
                        its own work on, for example, the level of assured destruction which is
                        essential to the allied concept of nuclear deterrence.</p>
                    <p>Surely it would be futile to attempt to foresee at what point and in exactly
                        what way we are going to need the understanding and support of our Western
                        allies in this affair. But just as surely, in my view, we would be derelict
                        if we did not begin the process of education on which that understanding and
                        support eventually must rest.</p>
                    <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0680"/>
                    <p>We have persuaded our allies to continue to forego nuclear weapons by
                        accepting <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>; we have predicted that sooner
                        or later we are going to bring home some of our forces from Europe; we are
                        now proposing to discuss possible limitations on the nuclear deterrent which
                        we have persuaded them is the foundation of their security. I do not think
                        it is alarmist to fear that out of such a sequence of events our European
                        friends might be tempted to reassess their interests in directions which
                        would not serve any US interests. In any event, we should certainly not risk
                        losing any important opportunity for us to participate, via the consultative
                        process, in their thinking about these matters.</p>

                        opening of the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d255fn2">Seaborg wrote this letter after <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> informed him by phone at 10:45
                            a.m. the same day that he was going to recommend to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> that he include in his message
                            to the opening of the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> “a plea for
                            a comprehensive test ban treaty and a complete cutoff of production of
                            fissionable material for nuclear weapons.” <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>, who already knew of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> concerns in these areas, agreed that Seaborg would
                            write an accompanying statement giving the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>'s point of view. (Seaborg, <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>,

                    </p>
                    <p>I and my fellow Commissioners have problems with Presidential reiteration or
                        endorsement at this time of two of the measures which are suggested as part
                        of the disarmament agenda.</p>
                    <p>We feel that it would be a mistake to reiterate at this time our previously
                        stated aim to “seek to achieve the discontinuance of all test explosions <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0681"/>of nuclear weapons for all time.”
                        We feel strongly that this is unrealistic in view of the absolute necessity
                        for underground testing in order to meet our announced commitments in the
                        field of strategic offensive weapons such as Poseidon and Minute Man, and
                        strategic defensive weapons such as the Sentinel (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>Our second item of concern is a Presidential request at this time to reach
                        agreement to halt all production of fissionable material for use in making
                        nuclear weapons. As you know, we have shut down already seven out of
                        fourteen of our plutonium production reactors and reduced our uranium-235
                        production by two-thirds. At a minimum, this would require further careful
                        study; the last comprehensive study on a government-wide basis was made in
                        1964. If something needed to be said on this subject at this time, credit
                        could be taken for what we have already done.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps these measures should be studied by the Committee of Principals
                        before any further public statement is made on them.<note n="3" xml:id="d255fn3">Regarding the President's decision on his <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> statement, see <ref target="#d256">Document 256</ref>.</note>

                            <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> Acting Director <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> for possible inclusion with the
                        draft Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee statement to be forwarded to the
                        President. On the same afternoon <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> telephoned <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>
                        to say that in view of <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>'s
                        letter, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked that a

                        statement be drafted, offering the President a choice. The second version
                        would not reiterate the concerns expressed in <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>'s letter but simply reference the fact that such
                        offers had been made before. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>,
                        DePalma (<gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>), and <persName corresp="#p_LA10">Allan Labowitz</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>'s disarmament assistant, drafted an alternative
                        statement the next day which, according to <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>, “merely recites previous U.S. statements regarding
                        a comprehensive test ban and fissionable material cutoff but does not press
                        for them.” (<persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, Volume 17, p. 47)</p>

                    <p>Under cover of a memorandum to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, July 15, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt
                        Rostow</persName> forwarded a July 15 memorandum from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> which attached a draft Presidential
                        message to the resumption of the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee the
                        following day. This draft message contained bracketed language reviewing
                        U.S. support for a verifiable comprehensive test ban and a cut-off of the
                        production of fissionable materials. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> explained in his memorandum that he preferred to
                        include the bracketed language, but then continued, “in view of the
                        importance of having a Presidential statement at the opening of the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> and the difficulty of resolving
                        conflicting views in the short time available, I recommend that you issue
                        the statement with the bracketed language deleted. At the same time,
                        however, I recommend that you authorize the delegation to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> to reply in the negative if asked by the
                        press or by other delegations whether the lack of any reference to these two

                    <p>In his covering memorandum, Rostow advised President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> to “proceed, as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> recommends, with the bracketed language
                        deleted.” The approval line, which reads “Statement cleared with bracketed

                    <p>The Intelligence Community has been asked to review <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 11-10-67, titled as above, dated 14 February 1967, and to
                        update that estimate because of the recent Soviet proposal regarding the
                        discussion of certain arms control measures.<note n="2" xml:id="d257fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d181fn6">footnote 6, Document 181</ref>.</note> In
                        this estimate we give primary consideration to the ability of intelligence
                        to monitor the deployment of certain strategic weapon systems, but we also
                        consider the likelihood of our detecting certain qualitative improvements to
                        various weapon systems.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. In the continued absence of a large-scale Soviet program of deception and
                        concealment, we believe that we would almost certainly detect any extensive
                        new deployment in strategic forces, although the Soviets could probably
                        effect small-scale increases without our knowledge. The timing of detection
                        and identification would vary with the nature and size of the program. We
                        probably would identify a land-mobile offensive system, for example, but
                            [<hi rend="italic">1-½ lines of source text not declassified</hi>] it
                        would be difficult to determine the magnitude of such a force.</p>
                    <p>B. We would almost certainly detect any large-scale test program, but we
                        could not always expect to assess accurately the test objectives or even the
                        precise nature of the system being tested. Our capabilities are generally
                        better in the case of offensive than of defensive weapons. We believe, for
                        example, that we could detect and identify Soviet testing of multiple
                        independently-targeted reentry vehicles (<gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s) for intercontinental ballistic missiles. We could probably
                        also detect test activity associated with an antiballistic missile (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>) system, [<hi rend="italic">1-½ lines of
                            source text not declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>C. Our capabilities for detecting qualitative improvements in the deployed
                        forces are better in the case of defensive weapons than offensive ones. To
                        optimize a surface-to-air missile (<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>)
                        system for an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> role would require such
                        extensive changes that some would almost certainly be detected and
                        identified [<hi rend="italic">2-½ lines of source text not
                        declassified</hi>]. We see no prospect of determining whether <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s (if developed) or other significant
                        improvements had been incorporated in deployed offensive missiles.</p>
                    <p>D. Soviet employment of deception and concealment on a large-scale would, of
                        course, degrade our capabilities. While we still believe that substantial
                        new deployment would almost certainly be detected, detection would come
                        later in the program, [<hi rend="italic">6 lines of source text not
                            declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>E. Factors affecting intelligence collection will vary over the period of
                        this estimate, but intelligence is not expected to be able to guarantee <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0684"/>that the Soviets have not violated
                        one or more provisions of an agreement.</p>

                    <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Harlan</persName>:</p>
                    <p>The problem of alliance consultation on the prospective strategic arms
                        limitation talks, to which you refer in your letter of July 12,<note n="2" xml:id="d258fn2">
                            <ref target="#d254">Document 254</ref>.</note> is one which we here have
                        fully in mind in our planning. In general, I share your conclusion that our
                        interests and the interests of our allies in this matter can be reconciled.</p>
                    <p>I am glad to have your projection of various possibilities for use of
                        alliance consultative machinery in coming months. Until our positions are
                        more fully developed and the course of the talks becomes clearer, we cannot
                        commit ourselves to any specific longer range program of action in alliance
                        consultative and planning bodies.</p>
                    <p>You should continue to make clear as you have already done, that we plan to
                        consult in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> as the situation develops. At
                        this time, the exchange of views already underway in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> on possible Soviet motivations and objectives is, in my
                        view, an appropriate starting point for such consultations. You may also
                        cite as appropriate the President's message of July 16 to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> and its indication of an initial emphasis
                        on a limitation or leveling off of strategic delivery systems to be followed
                        by consideration of reductions of existing systems. If it would be useful in
                        further allaying unwarranted concerns, you may point out to our allies that
                        since the US, for sound reasons of national interest, could not conceivably
                        agree to impair its deterrent, the interests of allied governments in
                        maintaining this deterrent would not be affected.</p>
                    <p>At present, there are certain difficulties which you should be particularly
                        alert to avoid. I believe that studies by the International Staff, the <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0685"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss>, or Polads at this stage could only be
                        detrimental to US freedom of action as we approach discussions in this
                        sensitive area. Moreover, we would not be able to make sufficient data
                        available to them to assure a realistic analysis. Accordingly, you should
                        seek to anticipate and avoid, insofar as possible, any actions or proposals
                        to institute such studies, and continue to concentrate on the numerous other
                        areas of disarmament activity already under consideration in the alliance.
                        It is also important, when the limits of useful consultation cannot yet be
                        delineated, to avoid any actions which would give rise to excessive

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> what was at the heart of the German
                        problem on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said he would express opinions
                        which were his and not those of the Cabinet nor of the SPD. He was <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0686"/>aware that his government had
                        inquired concerning a number of details and he did not want to go into them
                        further. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had been satisfied on most
                        of them. He agreed with the goals of the Treaty. Who would want Nasser,
                        etc., to have a nuclear weapon? The German problem is what will be the
                        political changes over the longer range as a result of the Treaty. If the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> does or does not sign, it will not
                        change the real situation. He continues to agree that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should not have a nuclear potential. This
                        would be wrong for political reasons. He wondered what rights the Soviets
                        might get from the Treaty for permanent intervention in Germany.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he did not quite
                        understand how the Treaty gave the Soviets any new power in that respect.
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said the Soviets
                        gave up nothing but got everything including a permanent right of accusing
                        the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> of doing things it should not do
                        under the Treaty. They will never be satisfied. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would never give access to nuclear weapons to their
                        friends. China already has them. He was also worried whether the Treaty
                        would discourage or encourage unification of Europe. One had to live with
                        the bomb just as one had to live with de Gaulle.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he did not see how
                        the Soviets could interfere on the basis of the Treaty. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> did not have to accept Soviet safeguard
                        inspectors. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said his
                        concerns were strengthened by the Soviet communication to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> of July 5. He was particularly concerned
                        with references to Article 53 and Article 107 of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. In the U.S. view, he knew that their application
                        was overtaken by events. However, the Soviets continued to maintain their
                        right to use military means against those defeated in World War II.
                        Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> agreed with him,
                        although he did not say it publicly, that there should be more assurance on
                        interpretations. We have them from the U.S. but not from the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> recalled we had gone
                        over the interpretations in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. We have
                        told the Russians what we are going to say. We do not expect their public
                        agreement. It is clear if they object, the question arises as to whether
                        there is a Treaty. He said the Russians were fully aware of our view on this
                        subject. He understood it to be the clear desire of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> not to leave an option for the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> but for Europe. The Soviets might object to
                        unification even without a Treaty. France and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> were not going to give up their nuclear weapons. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said in the case of European unity
                        they eventually would have to transfer them to the unified Europe.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> did not see the use of
                        the withdrawal clause as any more difficult than a decision not to sign the
                        Treaty. If the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> did not sign, they would
                        still be open to accusations. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>
                        said we should not <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0687"/>always worry
                        about Soviet accusations. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> recalled that these problems did not just come from the
                        East but from the West.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary Rostow said, with regard to <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>' concern about the European option, he had discussed
                        the problem at length with several, including Birrenbach.<note n="2" xml:id="d259fn2">Kurt Birrenbach, prominent West German businessman and
                            member of the Bundestag.</note> As a result, he had reviewed the
                        international law of succession, and concluded that whether Europe was
                        formed federally or confederally, the doctrine applied when the parties said
                        it did. Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> agreed. He
                        recalled that the Secretary once said that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should get rid of the Mercator Projection. It was a fact that
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had three neighbors—the United
                        States, Communist China and Europe. If he were a Russian leader, he would do
                        anything to avoid a unified Europe, even a unified Communist Europe.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that is why we want
                        a unified Europe since if Europe were secure there would be no reason for
                        war between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the US.</p>

                    <p>—He raised the matter with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had no answer
                        and assumed this was because the leaders in Moscow were “very busy.”</p>
                    <p>—Sect. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> assumes this is due to
                        their preoccupation with the Czech crisis.</p>
                    <p>—If the Soviets intervene militarily in Czechoslovakia, he assumes that the

                    <p>—If, as a result of the current Soviet-Czech meetings the situation is
                        peacefully resolved, he would propose going back shortly to Dobrynin and

                    <p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
                    <p>We already have agreed between our governments to enter in the near future
                        into the negotiations on the curbing of the strategic armaments race.</p>
                    <p>My colleagues and myself attach great significance to the negotiations on
                        this question. In fact this is one of the major questions of disarmament,
                        which were discussed during the last 20-odd years.</p>
                    <p>A complex<note n="2" xml:id="d261fn2">The word “overall” has been inserted by
                            hand above this word as an alternate translation.</note> limitation and
                        then a reduction of both the offensive strategic nuclear weapons delivery
                        systems and the systems of defense against ballistic missiles would answer
                        the interests of our countries and not only of our countries. Successful
                        outcome of these negotiations would create favourable conditions for the
                        solution of other big questions in the field of disarmament.</p>
                    <p>It is also, we believe, far from being all the same for<note n="3" xml:id="d261fn3">Above the phrase, “far from being all the same for,”
                            has been inserted by hand as an alternate translation, “not a matter of
                            indifference to both.”</note> our countries that the reduction of the
                        strategic armaments would lead to a great saving of money which is being
                        spent now for these purposes.</p>
                    <p>We have no doubts that you are now considering, just as we are, all aspects
                        of this problem. We think that within one month or a month and a half the
                        representatives of both our countries could start the exchange of opinions
                        on this question.</p>
                    <p>Our view is that Geneva could be a suitable place for the negotiations. A
                        concrete date of the negotiations could be agreed upon additionally and we
                        will be glad to hear your considerations to that effect.</p>
                    <p>Of course I must tell you frankly that whatever approach to the solution of
                        the problem of curbing the strategic arms race might be it is impossible to
                        consider it in isolation from the whole international situation, from the
                        tension that exists at present in the world. I think that you too, Mr.
                        President, understand this perfectly well. That is why it is necessary to
                        exert all efforts in order to ensure most favourable conditions for the
                        success of negotiations on this extremely important problem.</p>

                        IN STRATEGIC ARMS TALKS</p>
                    <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                    <p>The Soviet decision to begin strategic arms limitation talks with the United
                        States marks a point of convergence for widely differing views within the
                        Kremlin leadership on internal economic goals, military force structure, and
                        the use of military power.</p>
                    <p>Central to the disagreement is the prospect that the relationship of Soviet
                        to US strategic capabilities—which the Soviets have improved in the past few
                        years through expensive weapons development and deployment programs—will
                        erode in the 1970's as the US implements widely publicized plans for
                        improving its strategic weapons. There is probably considerable doubt within
                        the ruling Politburo about the technical prospects and economic effects of
                        trying to counter these developments at this time with new weapons programs.</p>
                    <p>Basic policy controversies may be sharpened as Soviet leaders attempt to
                        formulate positions to be taken in the talks and decide what to do with the
                        freed resources after an arms limitation agreement. Some Politburo members
                        probably hope to divert resources from strategic arms to investment
                        programs. A freeze on deployment of strategic weapons could eventually
                        release as much as 2-½ billion rubles a year—equivalent to 13 percent of the
                        total investment in industry in 1967—for other objectives, such as economic
                        growth or an increase in funds for consumer welfare. It is also possible
                        that strong elements within the Politburo see the prospect of stabilizing
                        the strategic arms race as an opportunity to improve Soviet conventional
                        forces and make them a more flexible and responsive arm of political power.</p>
                    <p>The military has not publicly placed its stamp of approval on the talks. On
                        the contrary, it has continued to stress the theme of international dangers
                        and the concomitant requirement for strengthened Soviet defenses. There are,
                        moreover, signs of a debate in military circles whether to pursue further
                        improvements in strategic capabilities or to settle for a stable strategic
                        relationship and broaden the capabilities of the conventional forces.</p>

                        Relationship</p>
                    <p>1. Recent decisions in the US concerning the Sentinel <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system probably were read by Soviet leaders as indicating
                        that the US is willing to continue the strategic arms race despite pressures
                        for economizing. On 27 June, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> included in his address to the Supreme Soviet a
                        statement of Soviet readiness to hold arms control talks.<note n="2" xml:id="d262fn2">Movement on the decision to enter into strategic arms
                            talks was first presaged in Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName>'s 26 April <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> proposal for limitation and subsequent
                            reduction of strategic arms. Soviet media remained silent on <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName>'s proposal until he
                            reiterated the line for arms limitations in another <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> speech on 20 May. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s 27 June acceptance of US
                            proposals to talk was promptly published in the Soviet press, with the
                            notable exception of the military press—an indication that important
                            pressure groups within the military had not become reconciled to the
                            Soviet policy change over the previous two months. [Footnote in the

                    </p>
                    <p>2. While the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> currently is in the final
                        stages of its third-generation <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        deployment and has an effective deterrent, this capability will begin to
                        erode in the early 1970's if Moscow does not match announced US plans for
                        upgrading its strategic defense and attack capabilities with the Sentinel,
                        Poseidon, and Minuteman III programs. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will have to improve its strategic forces
                        substantially—qualitatively or quantitatively—to maintain its current
                        position relative to the US.</p>
                    <p>3. What is probably most ominous to the Soviet authorities is that planned US
                        force improvements may threaten the Soviet capability for deterrence. Thus
                        they are faced with the possibility that despite all their planning, effort,
                        and spending on strategic forces over the last 20 years, they will still
                        have reason to be dissatisfied with the future strategic relationship.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Guns or Growth: Alternative Uses of Economic
                        Resources</p>
                    <p>4. Given such strategic considerations alone, Soviet leaders could have come
                        to the conclusion that they had much to gain by breaking the 18-month period
                        of indecision on accepting US proposals for talks on strategic arms
                        limitations. The Politburo as a whole, however, probably opted for talks at
                        this time because of divergent policy views reflecting still unresolved
                        controversies regarding internal economic goals, military force structure,
                        and the utility of various forms and levels of military power. Indeed, basic
                        policy issues may be sharpened as political leaders struggle to form a
                        consensus on a coherent negotiating position while proposals for arms
                        control unfold.</p>
                    <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0691"/>
                    <p>5. Even the announcement of Soviet willingness to negotiate has exposed
                        differences of opinion among leading spokesmen and interest groups. The
                        government organ <hi rend="italic">Izvestiya</hi> has endorsed the arms
                        control initiatives contained in the speeches of Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. Party chief <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> endorsed the talks on 3 July, but
                        qualified his approval at the 8 July military graduates' assembly when he
                        reasserted the military spenders' line that “as long as imperialism exists”
                        the socialist countries will take “every measure to strengthen their
                        defense.” The military press has chosen to highlight the harsher aspects of
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s line, while remaining
                        silent on the desirability of arms limitations.</p>
                    <p>6. One issue likely to be divisive among the top Soviet leaders is the matter
                        of where to reallocate any resources freed by an agreement. Owing to the
                        vagaries of Kremlin politics, there is no basis for predicting exactly how
                        the Soviet leadership might utilize the resources released by an agreement
                        to limit the expansion of strategic forces.</p>
                    <p>7. It is possible that among those Politburo members who favor negotiations,
                        strong elements see stability in strategic armaments, if achievable, as an
                        opportunity to turn conventional military forces into a more flexible,
                        efficient arm of political power. Strategic power, nevertheless, appears to
                        hold top priority among these men, some of whom may press for continued
                        qualitative upgrading of the existing strategic forces and an
                        intensification of research and development on new weapon systems. Some
                        Politburo members may not seriously expect that talks would, over the long
                        run, be successful in stabilizing matters. But in the short run, the
                        Politburo as a whole probably has serious reservations about the technical
                        and economic desirability of countering currently programmed US weapons
                        improvements. The majority could thus regard strategic arms talks at this
                        time as a way, at the least, of exploring the US position and seeking to
                        delay US programs at little cost to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>8. Another group within the Politburo—the more ardent advocates of economic
                        growth—can make a strong case for a major reallocation from defense to the
                        civilian economy at the present time. Increases in consumer welfare, coming
                        on top of expanded military expenditures, are necessarily being accomplished
                        at the expense of investment. The Soviet leadership is thus running the risk
                        of slowing down the rate of economic growth, that is, of impairing future
                        capacity for supporting military as well as civilian programs. Moreover, the
                        substantial increases in defense spending that would be necessary to halt
                        the erosion of the present Soviet strategic position would almost certainly
                        cause long-term economic problems.</p>
                    <p>9. A precise calculation of the potential savings of any contemplated arms
                        control agreement cannot be made until the detailed terms <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0692"/>of the agreement are available. A general
                        appreciation of the possible savings can be obtained, however, by examining
                        the estimates of future Soviet expenditures for the deployment and operation
                        of certain strategic weapons systems—long range bombers, strategic missile
                        and space systems, ballistic-missile submarines, and the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>—and assuming that there would be a complete
                        moratorium on further deployment of these systems. Under these conditions,
                        the Soviets could reduce expenditures on the average about 2.5 billion
                        rubles a year for the period of the early 1970's. This calculation assumes
                        that the Soviets maintain their current high levels of expenditures for
                        research and development, space efforts, and nonstrategic defense programs.</p>
                    <p>10. The allocation of the presumed savings in defense expenditures to
                        industrial investment programs would provide a base for accelerated growth
                        in the economy—2.5 billion rubles representing about 13 percent of total
                        Soviet investment in industry in 1967. Since these particular resources
                        include the best managerial and technical talents available, their
                        contribution to the sorely needed modernization of the Soviet economy would
                        probably be even greater than indicated by monetary measures alone.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Military Debate: Strategic Power Versus Usable
                        Power</p>
                    <p>11. The professional military may have different considerations in mind. In
                        fact, they seem to be of at least two minds on the goals to be sought: one,
                        to pursue a costly attempt to attain a “massive retaliation,” or even a
                        first strike, capability; two, to settle for a stable strategic relationship
                        through an arms limitation agreement and to refurbish and expand
                        conventional capabilities to permit more flexible application of military
                        power. Perhaps the division within the military leadership—in conjunction
                        with the other considerations mentioned earlier—facilitated the decision to
                        discuss arms limitations at this time.</p>
                    <p>12. At any rate, future force structure discussions within the Soviet
                        military have recently carried a particularly polemical tone. For example,
                        Colonel I. Grudinin writing in the late May 1968 issue of Communist of the
                        Armed Forces referred to “certain authors” who fail to emphasize the
                        necessity for “overwhelming” strategic superiority. In contrast to
                        Grudinin-like arguments, Colonel General Povaliy, the planning chief on the
                        Soviet General Staff, had noted two months earlier that overwhelming
                        strategic superiority—or “massive retaliation”—had become “quite unrealistic
                        and unconvincing.”</p>
                    <p>13. The Povaliy article, in the 12 March <hi rend="italic">Red Star</hi>,
                        observed that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the United States
                        endorse the policy of fighting future wars with the weapons that “correspond
                        to the nature of the possible clash.” It went on to stress that the
                        “imperialists” will continue to try to achieve their goals with the use of
                        only conventional weapons or tactical nuclear weapons. Under the concept of
                        more flexible options, according to <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0693"/>Povaliy, a state need not run the risk of nuclear war “in every situation
                        in which its allies become involved” and can pursue its own
                        military-political objectives with the least threat to its security.</p>
                    <p>14. Certain military leaders are wary of the current trend in Soviet doctrine
                        toward rejection of the “massive retaliation” doctrine as the cornerstone of
                        Soviet strategy. They have argued that the use of conventional forces does
                        not undermine the reliance on nuclear weapons. The development of strategic
                        attack forces, in their view, must continue to command priority. Advocates
                        of this “massive retaliation” view remain a strong force within the Soviet
                        military. French Defense Minister Mess-mer reportedly stated after a visit
                        to Moscow in April that “old Russian generals are really old”—that they
                        cling to a strategy of immediate all-out nuclear retaliation, uninfluenced
                        by any of the recent military doctrines advanced in the US and elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>15. One well-known old Russian marshal, the late V.D. Sokolovskiy, was a
                        proponent of strong strategic nuclear forces. His book Military Strategy,
                        reissued late last year, reflected the view that any war between nuclear
                        powers will “inevitably” escalate into a general nuclear conflict. The
                        initial period of war will be decisive, the marshal claimed. He added that
                        the Soviet Union will be able to detect preparations for a “surprise nuclear
                        attack” and must have the means to deal the enemy a “crushing blow of
                        decisive significance.”</p>
                    <p>16. Sokolovskiy's views appear to be under attack within the military
                        establishment by advocates of a flexible-response strategy. One such
                        advocate mentioned above, Colonel General Povaliy, remarked to a US military
                        attache that Sokolovskiy's Military Strategy was “obsolete,” explaining that
                        Soviet strategy has no label but that the Soviet Union is “ready to meet
                        whatever the situation requires.”</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>I was much interested in you letter of July 25<note n="2" xml:id="d263fn2">
                            <ref target="#d261">Document 261</ref>.</note> on the subject of talks
                        about curbing the strategic arms race. I agree with your remarks about <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0694"/>the great importance of this
                        question to both our countries, to other nations as well, and to the general
                        and urgent problem of disarmament.</p>
                    <p>We agree that Geneva would be a suitable place for the negotiations. You
                        indicate that a period of a month to a month and a half would provide a
                        suitable interval for preparations. This time period of “a month to a month
                        and a half” is acceptable.</p>
                    <p>As for the level at which the talks might begin, we would be ready to
                        initiate the discussions at the level of Chiefs of Government, Foreign
                        Ministers, or heads of special delegations in Geneva.</p>
                    <p>We will be glad to have your suggestions as to the exact dates and the level
                        of representation. We should also consult upon when and how an announcement
                        of the meeting should be made. There could be some advantage if the general
                        situation would permit an announcement to be made before the convening of
                        the Non-Nuclear Conference in late August.<note n="3" xml:id="d263fn3">The
                            Conference of Non-Nuclear Weapon States, sponsored by the United
                            Nations, met in Geneva August 29-September 28. See <ref target="#d284">Documents 284</ref> and <ref target="#d286">286</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I do hope that our forthcoming discussions on the strategic arms race can
                        produce constructive results because I believe that our peoples would join
                        in a common desire for a successful outcome.</p>
                    <p>We share, of course, your understanding that it is essential for both of us
                        to make every effort to create the most favorable climate for these talks.
                        If problems arise in the general situation which complicate prospects for
                        success, we can of course be in touch with each other.</p>

                    <p rend="center">STRATEGIC MISSILE TALKS PROPOSAL</p>
                    <p>The elements of a U.S. proposal for the proposed U.S.-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> strategic missile talks are outlined
                        below. This proposal should be viewed as an entity since that is the basis
                        on which it has been evaluated.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Fixed Land-Based <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> Launchers</p>
                    <p>The proposal would require cessation of the initiation of construction of any
                        additional strategic offensive land-based missile launchers as of September
                        1, 1968. The Soviet Union would be permitted to complete the launchers which
                        it is constructing as of that date. Beyond that date, however, it would not
                        be allowed to initiate further deployment of fixed <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers. Under no circumstances would either side be
                        permitted to deploy more than 1,200 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        launchers. Building of additional silos, enlarging of existing silos,
                        changing basic external configuration of silos and other <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0696"/>launchers, and the relocation of launchers
                        would be prohibited. No additional restrictions would be imposed upon
                        technological improvements of launchers or missiles already deployed
                        including increasing the hardness of existing silos and deployment of <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>'s, or the retrofitting of existing
                        launchers with new missiles.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Fixed Land-Based IRBM/<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> Launchers</p>
                    <p>Further construction of fixed land-based launchers for IRBM/<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> (ranges greater than 1,000 km) would be
                        prohibited. The retrofitting of existing IRBM/<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> launchers to accommodate <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        missiles would be prohibited. The installation of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> missiles on IRBM/<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>
                        launchers would be prohibited as would the conversion of IRBM/<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> missiles to <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> missiles. Building of additional silos, enlarging of existing
                        silos, changing basic external configuration of silos and other launchers
                        and the relocation of launchers would be prohibited. No additional
                        restrictions would be imposed upon technological improvements of launchers
                        or missiles already deployed or the retrofitting of existing launchers with
                        new missiles of intermediate or medium range.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Mobile Land-Based Strategic Offensive Missile
                        Systems</p>
                    <p>The proposal would impose a complete ban on the deployment of mobile
                        land-based, strategic offensive missile systems (ranges greater than 1,000
                        km). Missile systems with such ranges carried by waterborne vehicles on
                        inland waterways would also be prohibited. Any such existing systems would
                        be destroyed.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Mobile Sea-Based Strategic Offensive Missile
                        Systems</p>
                    <p>A. The proposal would ban the construction of additional strategic offensive
                        missile launching submarines or of additional launchers in existing
                        submarines. This prohibition should apply to all submarines with ballistic
                        missile or cruise missile launchers. Such submarines under construction as
                        of September 1, 1968, could be completed, subject to agreement on their
                        number. There would be no limitation on the characteristics of SLBMs or
                        SLCMs, or on retrofitting missile submarines with new or larger missiles of
                        the type with which they are equipped. The fitting out of surface ships with
                        facilities for firing offensive ballistic missiles would be prohibited.</p>
                    <p>B. There would be no replacement of ballistic or cruise missile submarines
                        within the first five years of the agreement. During that period the two
                        sides would undertake to reach agreement on rules governing subsequent
                        replacement of submarines. In the absence of a supplementary agreement on
                        such rules, each side may replace submarines after five years from the date
                        of the initiation of the agreement provided that replacement does not
                        increase the total number of submarines or of submarine-launched ballistic
                        missiles or cruise missiles.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s</p>
                    <p>The proposal would ban the deployment of more than a set and equal number of
                        fixed, land-based anti-ballistic missile launchers and associated radars. A
                        total prohibition on deployment of mobile <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems, both land-based and sea-based, would be imposed. There
                        would be no other constraints on the characteristics of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems deployed.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. Aircraft and Anti-aircraft Systems</p>
                    <p>The proposal would not include limitations on aircraft or anti-aircraft
                        systems.</p>
                    <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0697"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VII. Technological Improvements</p>
                    <p>There would be no prohibition of technological improvement within the
                        constraints of the agreement.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VIII. Verification</p>
                    <p>The limitations described in paragraphs I through V are proposed to be
                        verified by national means.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">IX. Provisions for Revision and Withdrawal</p>
                    <p>A. Either party may propose revision of the agreement if it believes that
                        conditions affecting the agreement have changed. The two parties shall meet
                        from time to time to discuss the operation of the agreement and possible
                        revisions.</p>
                    <p>B. Ten years after entry into force of this agreement the two parties shall
                        meet for a formal review of the operation of the agreement with a view to
                        assuring that the purposes of the agreement, with any revisions that may
                        have been made during the 10-year period, are being realized. In the absence
                        of agreement by the two parties on the continued operation of the agreement
                        with necessary revisions, either party may withdraw by giving six months
                        notice prior to 11 years from the day of entry into force of the agreement.
                        Otherwise, the agreement shall be automatically renewed for another ten
                        years, at which time this review procedure shall be repeated.</p>
                    <p>C. Either party shall in exercising its national sovereignty have the right
                        to withdraw from the agreement at any time if it decides that extraordinary
                        events, related to the subject matter of the agreement, have jeopardized the
                        supreme interests of its country.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. On the evening of 5 August, I attended a dinner at the residence of the
                        Netherlands Ambassador in honor of Mr. and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Walter Stoessel</persName>,<pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0698"/>
                        Ambassador-designate to Poland. Among the guests were Ambassador and Mrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. After dinner, when we
                        were joining the ladies, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> took the opportunity to engage me in conversation in
                        company with our former Ambassador to Poland, Mr. Gronouski. Mr. Gronouski
                        moved away after a few moments, leaving Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and me alone until the gathering
                        broke up more than 30 minutes later.</p>
                    <p>2. The early part of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s remarks were of a general nature. He commented on the
                        differences in the roles of the top military in the Soviet Union and the
                        United States, citing the fact that I regularly attend the Tuesday White
                        House luncheons while the Soviet military never appear at the weekly
                        meetings of the seven-man top ruling group of the Soviet Union and only
                        attend the Politburo meetings when a specific item of a military nature is
                        on the agenda. He commented also on the composition of the classes at our
                        National War College and said they had nothing of a similar nature in the
                        Soviet Union. After about ten minutes, he switched to the subject of the
                        upcoming talks on limitations of strategic missiles which, because he
                        repeated each point several times during the ensuing 25 minutes or so, I
                        presume was the real purpose of his conversation with me.</p>
                    <p>3. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> made, several
                        times over, the following points:</p>
                    <p>a. In a sense the United States has established goals which the Russians are
                        determined to reach or even surpass. (In the context of his remarks, I was
                        persuaded that he was speaking in this instance of non-military matters.)</p>
                    <p>b. The upcoming Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (<gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>) could be extremely important because they could lead to
                        further improvements in relations and unspecified benefits to all.</p>
                    <p>c. The Soviets are unsure as to exactly what we want to achieve. Is it a
                        freeze? This doubt has been fertilized by statements by United States
                        officials as to our military superiority in the strategic area. These
                        statements lead to demands for more forces (missile, I assume)—100, 200, 300
                        more.</p>
                    <p>d. The United States and the Soviet Union are both great nations. If we
                        approach the talks on the basis of equality, results can be achieved. (By
                        inference, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        conveyed the impression that any other approach would negate achievement.)</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s manner throughout our conversation was very
                        friendly and sincere. Obviously he was determined to make his points with me
                        because he twice refused to be persuaded by our hostess from taking a seat
                        with a group of ladies. He emphasized the importance of us approaching the
                        talks on the basis of “equality.” From the way in which he used this word, I
                        gained the impression that he meant two things: First, the recognition on
                        our part that we would be dealing with a militarily equal nation. (Of
                        interest is the fact that the <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0699"/>Ambassador said they believed themselves to be ahead of us in certain
                        military areas while recognizing that we were ahead of them in others.) The
                        other meaning which I think he conveyed by his use of the word “equality”
                        was parity of forces; however, he did not at that time elaborate on this
                        aspect nor did he use the word “parity” at any time.</p>
                    <p>5. As the dinner party broke up, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he had enjoyed very much talking to me
                        and hoped to be able to renew our conversation at an early date.</p>

                    <p>[Here follows discussion of a telephone conversation with <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Donald Hornig</persName> on the upcoming <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> Conference, testing, and the Fermi
                        Award.]</p>
                    <p>At 10:30 a.m. I met with the Executive Committee of the Committee of
                        Principals in the Secretary of State's Conference Room. Present were
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> (Chairman), <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName>, Keeney, <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Scoville</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH8">Harold Brown</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_WPC2">Warnke</persName>; plus <persName corresp="#p_LA10">Labowitz</persName>, Kirby Gean, Ivan Selin (<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>), et al. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> opened the meeting by emphasizing that there is a need for
                        finding positive ways to make progress in arms limitation. He suggested that
                        the meeting start with a status report on the work of the interagency
                        Working Group, and called on Adrian <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> to give the report.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> called attention to the fact
                        that the Working Group's conclusions were summarized in his memorandum to
                        the Executive Committee of the Committee of Principals, dated July 31, 1968
                        (copy attached), which enclosed the summary paper, “Strategic Missile Talks
                            Proposal.”<note n="2" xml:id="d266fn2">See <ref target="#d264fn1">footnote 1, Document 264</ref>.</note> He said that, in view of
                        this, and assuming that the Principals have read <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0700"/>the paper, he would not take the time to describe it here.
                        He said that it deals solely with a freeze on missiles and not on the
                        production problem. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> also
                        referred to the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> documents analyzing the
                        national detection capabilities. He said we don't yet have individual agency
                        positions on this matter, but we do have a <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> analysis on the military effectiveness of the strategic missile
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then called for the DOD report.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> said that this has been
                        a priority item within <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and Selin would
                        present the briefing. He stated that this material has not yet been
                        evaluated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Selin then made an analysis
                        comparing the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> strategic
                        forces and their effectiveness in first strikes and retaliation from first
                        strikes with and without an agreement on limitation of strategic missiles.
                        He gave us a paper that summarized his remarks. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> then called on General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> to give us his views. <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> said that such an arrangement to
                        limit strategic missiles would lead to political problems; one of these
                        would be that it would create a strain within the alliance, another was the
                        possibility the Soviets would clandestinely increase their land-based mobile
                        system, which would be possible because we don't have means of verification.
                        Another problem would arise if we should attempt to limit the radars because
                        we can't verify this. He said he thought the limitations on the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> might be the core of the problem, that this
                        could make us vulnerable to attacks from Nth countries.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> raised the question whether we
                        couldn't establish a Joint U.S.-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        Commission on Strategic Missiles to serve as a forum to discuss the problems
                        on a day-to-day basis and to monitor the progress in missile limitation.
                        Such a Commission would look into any allegations of violations. This might
                        be better than a formal treaty such as we have for the test ban. In this
                        connection, he asked <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> to think
                        of the form as well as the content of a strategic missiles limitation.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> said he could visualize
                        such a Joint Commission within a treaty, but that a Joint Commission alone
                        would not receive the approval of Congress because they would want to have
                        the terms spelled out. Both <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> responded by saying they
                        thought the Joint Commission could be put in a form so that Congress would
                        approve; perhaps a joint resolution of Congress could be used for this
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked me whether I had any
                        comment. In referring to the briefing by Selin, I said I thought the Soviets
                        surely would go to the building of <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s. I
                        asked why this was considered as an uncertainty concerning Soviet
                        intentions. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that they might
                        want to seek an agreement to prohibit <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s, but that if <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s were not
                        prohibited, it would seem like the Soviets would add them to their arsenal.
                        I said we should make an analysis of the consequences of both sides
                        eliminating <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s and bombers.</p>
                    <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0701"/>
                    <p>We then turned to the third agenda item, even though <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> had left the meeting to take a
                        phone call. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> introduced this
                        item, which had to do with the U.S. <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>
                        test program. He gave us a paper covering this item.<note n="3" xml:id="d266fn3">Not further identified.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> raised the question as to why
                            <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s are better than separate re-entry
                        vehicles, and was told by several people present that, for a given launch
                        capability and cost, more coverage could be accomplished with <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s than with separate re-entry vehicles.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked when the first <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> test is scheduled to take place and
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> indicated it would be on
                        August 15th or 16th. When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> re-entered the room, <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> asked him whether he thought it was wise for him
                            (<persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>) to hold a press
                        conference announcing the <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> test
                        program. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> asked whether it
                        wouldn't be better to have a <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> press
                        officer, such as Phil Goulding, announce it. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested that another alternative would be just to issue a
                        written statement. He said there was some belief, for example in the recent
                        Times article, that starting the testing of <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s forecloses the possibility of ever prohibiting them.</p>
                    <p>I said it should be remembered that the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>
                        has an accelerated, or crash program, for the construction of the nuclear
                        warheads for the <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s, for Poseidon and
                        for Minuteman III, and that authorization and commitment has already been
                        undertaken for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of construction for
                        this purpose, which is already underway. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> summarized the discussion by asking whether anyone was
                        suggesting a postponement of the <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>
                        tests, and it was apparent that no one was suggesting such a postponement.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> indicated that McCarthy might
                        make an issue in the election of suggesting a postponement. On the other
                        hand, if the <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> tests were postponed,
                        Nixon would make an issue of it. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        suggested that <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> try to issue the most
                        unexciting press announcement possible, and as soon as possible. He asked
                        whether the press is always present at the <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> test launchings, and <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said, “Yes, this has been the best policy.” <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> closed the meeting by indicating that
                        the Principals would meet again a week from today, at the same time.</p>
                    <p>I met with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> at 12 noon,
                        at his request, following the Meeting of the Principals. [Here follows
                        discussion of visas for an Israeli and South African to a Soviet conference.
                        At the conclusion of this private meeting, Seaborg noted:] I indicated to
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> that I have the impression
                        the U.S. is depending very much on the <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s for its strategic offensive and deterrent capability and that
                        it would be difficult to get agreement for any treaty which included as a
                        provision the prohibition of <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s.</p>

                    <p>The Committee of Principals is scheduled to meet at 10:30 am, Wednesday,
                        August 14, to review and prepare recommendations for the President on our

                        264</ref>.</note> for the strategic arms limitation talks (<gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>). On Saturday, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> completed its review of this specific
                        proposal that has been developed by an Interagency Working Group. On the
                        basis of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommendation to Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>, I believe that the
                        Committee of Principals should be able to agree upon a favorable
                        recommendation to the President on a slightly revised version of this
                        proposal. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, except for the Navy,
                        bought the interagency proposal, subject to four clarifying changes, which
                        should be acceptable to all the other agencies involved. The Navy split was
                        in the form of a proposed modification favoring Navy systems which was not
                        acceptable to the other Chief on the grounds of security. (General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> prepared a separate strong paper

                    <p>At a meeting of the Committee of Principals last Wednesday, August 7, the
                        status of preparations for the talks was reviewed, and the Committee
                        endorsed Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>'s
                        decision to proceed on August 16, as scheduled, with the first all-up test
                        launch of the Minuteman III with a <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>.
                        (See attached Minutes, Tab B.)<note n="5" xml:id="d267fn5">Not attached.
                            Seaborg's notes (<ref target="#d266">Document 266</ref>) are the only
                            record of the August 7 meeting found.</note> As you know, the latter
                        point has been made a major issue by Senator McCarthy and Bob Klieman (New
                        York Times), among others, on the grounds that the successful <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0703"/>test of a <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> would make a strategic freeze impossible. It was agreed that,
                        on the contrary, quite aside from security considerations, a unilateral
                        moratorium on such testing at this time could hurt the prospects for a
                        agreement by its effects on the attitudes of both Congress and the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The staff preparations for the talks are on schedule, and I believe in
                        general are in reasonably good shape. The proposed position developed by the
                        Interagency Working Group (Tab A) has been carefully drafted to take into
                        account specific problems that have been advanced while retaining the form
                        of a general commitment. There should be no misunderstanding as to the
                        nature of the proposal on which interagency agreement and Presidential
                        approval are being sought.</p>
                    <p>Systems Analysis has prepared the attached detailed study of the proposal
                        which was summarized for the Committee of Principals last Wednesday.
                        (Presentation to Committee and complete study, Tab C.)<note n="6" xml:id="d267fn6">Not found.</note> You should read at least the summary
                        presentation to the Committee. Although not formally agreed to within the
                        Pentagon, it appears to be generally accepted as the point of departure in
                        evaluating the proposal. The basic point is that our forces are so large and
                        diverse that our assured destruction capability is relatively insensitive to
                        most forms of qualitative improvements, cheating, or abrogation scenarios.
                        The most serious threat appears to be the rapid clandestine deployment of a
                        massive, highly effective <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system;
                        however, even in this case, there would be compensatory actions we could
                        take to maintain a high level of assured destruction.</p>

                        intelligence to monitor the proposal by national means. This is, in general,
                        an excellent, responsible job, which comes directly to grips with the
                        problem and does not hide behind qualifying uncertainties. You should read
                        it in its entirety. It does not, however, answer all the questions. In
                        particular, I am not satisfied with the treatment of <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s which, although not now covered in our
                        proposal, could be subsequently introduced by the Soviets or ourselves.
                        While on balance the judgment may well be correct that we would probably
                        detect a Soviet <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> test program, I am not
                        yet convinced of the intelligence community's ability to back up this
                        conclusion in the face of critics fearful of a Soviet clandestine program.</p>

                        have also prepared a detailed report (Tab E)<note n="8" xml:id="d267fn8">Dated August 1. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Intelligence
                            File, Arms Limitation Talk, Box 11)</note> concerning the critical
                        problem of the possibility of upgrading the Tallinn <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> system into an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system
                        unknown to our unilateral intelligence. As I <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0704"/>indicated above, the military analysis concluded that this
                        type of development was the most serious threat we would face under the
                        agreement. Unfortunately, this report is somewhat confusing since, although
                        it concludes that the system could be upgraded to have <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capabilities without our knowledge, it also
                        concludes that the resulting system would have quite limited capabilities
                        and be extremely vulnerable. The problem of defining present and future
                        capabilities of the Tallinn system clearly remains one of the most serious
                        and difficult issues to be dealt with in these talks.</p>
                    <p>In view of the above, I think we can now count on being able to pre-sent an
                        agreed-upon, forthcoming specific proposal, which has been staffed in
                        considerable depth, in the event the talks begin in the next few weeks.
                        There are, however, still some major tactical issues that will have to be
                        resolved before the initiation of the talks. I believe the most difficult of
                        these will be how we deal with the question of on-site inspections. Although
                        it is agreed that our present proposal could be monitored by unilateral
                        means, it is also obvious that it could be more effectively monitored if
                        there were provisions for on-site inspection of critical facilities or
                        suspicious activities. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> has
                        specifically asked that an effort be made to obtain provisions for on-site
                        inspections. How this is to be done in an effective manner in the talks
                        without jeopardizing the prospects of success, since we have certainly
                        implied our proposal would not require on-site inspection, will be a major
                        challenge to the skill of our negotiators.</p>
                    <p>There are also a number of major unresolved substantive issues which
                        preferably should be resolved before the talks but will certainly have to be
                        resolved early in the negotiations if they appear to be going anywhere. The
                        most important of these is what level of limitation on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment we wish to achieve. Our present
                        position calls only for a “set and equal number,” and we have not as yet
                        agreed on a preferred level. Consideration is currently being given to the
                        relative merits of 0, 100, 600, and 1000. Closely related is the difficult
                        issue of how to deal with the Tallinn system in defining its present
                        capabilities and controlling future upgrading. Finally, there is the general
                        question of whether the agreement should be in the form of a detailed formal
                        treaty or some form of informal understanding.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>I. We have examined the Arms Control Proposal as described in Tab A,<note n="2" xml:id="d268fn2">Not found.</note> and have found that, on
                        balance, and subject to the assumptions and conditions set forth in Section
                        III below, an agreement based upon it<note n="3" xml:id="d268fn3">The Chief
                            of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps believe that
                            the proposal should be revised as indicated in Tab D. [Footnote in the
                            source text. Tab D is an undated paper, “Modification of the Proposal
                            Proposed by the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the

                        U.S. security. Specifically, we conclude that within the terms of such an
                        agreement we would be able to:</p>
                    <p>a. maintain the U.S. deterrent posture;</p>
                    <p>b. leave the Soviet Government and world opinion in no doubt as to the
                        adequacy of the U.S. deterrent posture;</p>
                    <p>c. be confident within the terms of the agreement that our deterrent posture
                        could not be eroded by the actions of the Soviet Union, or any other nuclear
                        power, alone or in combination;</p>
                    <p>d. maintain a U.S. capability to limit damage to the United States by Soviet
                        forces if deterrence fails, at least as effective as that which we can
                        expect to obtain in the absence of an agreement; and</p>
                    <p>e. provide a strategic capability that would prevent nuclear powers other
                        than the Soviet Union from threatening the stability of the agreement.</p>
                    <p>II. Our conclusions in regard to the agreement are based on an analysis of
                        the next 8-10 years. However, we cannot predict new Soviet weapon systems
                        more than a few years ahead, and, therefore, we must continually have the
                        freedom to reassess and to revise the agreement, or withdraw. We know of no
                        way to determine whether the agreement—if it should remain unchanged—will
                        continue to be in our interest. It is contemplated that we would exercise
                        our right to terminate the agreement if we conclude that our national
                        interest can be better protected in a different way. We must be prepared to
                        withdraw at any time if our security requires us to do so.</p>
                    <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0706"/>
                    <p>We also believe that the agreement proposed may well need modification from
                        time to time if it is to continue to preserve our security. In particular,
                        we are concerned that freezing the location and inhibiting our ability to
                        harden existing land-based silos could over time lead to a situation of
                        instability, in that our land-based missile force might be destroyed in a
                        first strike by the Soviet offensive missile forces; this situation could
                        develop if the Soviets were to exploit their potential for substantially
                        increasing their present advantage in throw weight and installing <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>'s, both of which are permitted under the
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>Over the next few years the proposed agreement cannot lead to major budgetary
                        savings and could even require some increases in spending; over a longer
                        period the savings could be substantial if we were able to forego the new
                        programs that might be rendered unnecessary by Soviet acceptance of the
                        agreement and the Soviets decided unilaterally to forego upgrading systems
                        not limited by the agreement. Of greater importance, we believe that the
                        agreement could lead to greater security for the United States over the next
                        8-10 years, provided that we take the necessary actions to maintain the
                        effectiveness of our strategic forces and remain in a position to react
                        promptly if the agreement is suddenly terminated.</p>
                    <p>III. Our conclusion that the agreement would preserve the security of the
                        U.S. is based on the following assumptions and conditions:</p>
                    <p>a. We must be confident that we possess a means of verifying an adequate
                        degree of compliance with the agreement. Based on both the assessment of the
                        Intelligence Community concerning their capability to verify compliance and
                        the sensitivity of U.S. security to Soviet cheating or abrogation, we
                        believe that national means of verification would enable us to monitor the
                        various specific limitations in the agreement, with varying degrees of
                        effectiveness. We have confidence that we would be able to monitor the
                        agreement in terms of numbers of fixed, land-based offensive and defensive
                        missile system launchers of known characteristics. However, within the fixed
                        offensive systems we have low confidence that we can verify the prohibition
                        against upgrading <gloss target="#t_IR1">IR</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> launchers to an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        capability and defensive missile systems to a <gloss target="#t_BMD1">BMD</gloss> capability. We also have low confidence that national means of
                        verification would permit us to monitor the terms of the agreement as they
                        pertain to mobile offensive and defensive systems. We must therefore:</p>
                    <p>(1) make a concerted effort to secure Soviet consent to some form of
                        inspection involving intrusion into each other's territory and air space to
                        verify limitations on systems other than those which we have reasonable
                        confidence of verifying through unilateral means alone. Such agreed
                        inspection procedures would increase the confidence of each side in the
                        other side's compliance with the agreement, as well as the general
                        confidence of allies that the results of the agreement are likely to be
                        beneficial. <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0707"/>It would permit a more
                        comprehensive agreement. It also is likely to increase the stability of
                        conditions and relationships;</p>
                    <p>(2) be prepared to use the necessary information from intelligence sources to
                        call possible violations to the attention of the Soviet Union;</p>
                    <p>(3) be prepared to withdraw from the agreement, if necessary, justifying our
                        actions by the public disclosure of data from intelligence sources;</p>
                    <p>(4) be prepared to withdraw from the agreement if the Soviets take steps
                        which erode our ability to monitor their compliance, since our verification
                        capability would be significantly degraded by Soviet efforts at concealment,
                        evasion, or interference.</p>
                    <p>b. An upper limit on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense should be
                        set at an equivalent number of fixed land-based <gloss target="#t_BMD1">BMD</gloss>-capable launchers and associated missiles, including reload
                        missiles. The exact <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> limits would be
                        determined during the course of negotiations with the Soviet Union, based
                        upon an assessment of Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>-capable
                        launchers and missile levels and our overall security objectives as they
                        relate to other nuclear powers and to all the provisions of the agreement.
                        The number should take cognizance of the need to defend against a threat
                        from the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> or other nuclear power during
                        the period of the agreement.</p>
                    <p>c. We must have satisfactory assurances that present and future antiaircraft
                        missile systems are not and will not become <gloss target="#t_BMD1">BMD</gloss> systems. We should take the initial position that, unless the
                        Soviets can assure us that SA-5 (Tallinn) is not and will not become a
                            <gloss target="#t_BMD1">BMD</gloss> system, it must be included in the
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> launcher limit. The degree of
                        assurance required will depend on the results of technical study of our
                        ability to detect a Soviet program to upgrade Tallinn to achieve various
                        degrees of <gloss target="#t_BMD1">BMD</gloss> potential.</p>
                    <p>d. [<hi rend="italic">3-½ lines of source text not declassified</hi>] We must
                        be assured that the Soviets do not replace existing <gloss target="#t_IR1">IR</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> missiles unless they
                        can satisfy us that the new missiles do not possess an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability. We would consider their
                        failure to provide us with adequate assurances, as needed, as constituting
                        grounds justifying our withdrawing from the agreement.</p>
                    <p>e. The agreement covers only what is prohibited and not what is permitted.
                        Specifically, there will be no prohibition on the development or deployment
                        of aircraft and air defense systems (except to prohibit their acquiring a
                            <gloss target="#t_BMD1">BMD</gloss> capability), on civil defense, or
                            <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>, on research and development, or on
                        the qualitative improvement of forces within the constraints specified in
                        the agreement. The development and deployment of improved post-boost
                        vehicles capable of delivering <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>'s to
                        individual targets or on depressed trajectories would not be prohibited.</p>
                    <p>f. Our judgment of acceptability is based on examination of the proposal as a
                        whole. We have not considered whether separate parts of it would constitute
                        an acceptable agreement. We would want to examine <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0708"/>any proposal which was confined to such
                        separate parts, or which proposed an agreement of wider scope.</p>
                    <p>g. When and if a proposal is approved for negotiation with the Soviet Union,
                        we would want the opportunity to comment on negotiating strategy and
                        tactics, instructions to the delegation, and on the initial presentation and
                        other statements of the U.S. position.</p>
                    <p>h. The agreement must be in the form of a treaty to be ratified by both
                            countries.<note n="4" xml:id="d268fn4">A handwritten notation in the
                            margin next to this sentence reads: “Sect. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> questions this. W[alt].”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>i. The U.S. must make it clear to the Soviet Union that either party would
                        have the right to withdraw from the agreement unless adequate revisions can
                        be negotiated—and in the absence of such revisions the United States must be
                        prepared to exercise its right of withdrawal from the agreement—under any of
                        the following circumstances:</p>
                    <p>(1) if the capability of any third country reaches the point where either
                        party to the agreement believes that its security is threatened;</p>
                    <p>(2) if events lead either party to believe that its deterrent capability is
                        threatened;</p>
                    <p>(3) if there is evidence of substantial concealment of systems affected by
                        the agreement or evidence of evasion of the terms of the agreement;</p>
                    <p>(4) if either party takes action which interferes significantly with the
                        other's verification capability or otherwise adversely affects the
                        capability of the other party to verify compliance with the agreement.</p>
                    <p>j. A system of unilateral safeguards must be established to insure that the
                        agreement continues to be in our interest and to insure that if the Soviets
                        violate or abrogate the agreement, or we decide for other reasons to
                        withdraw from the agreement, that we are in a position to take the steps
                        necessary to maintain our security.</p>
                    <p>IV. The Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the Army, Navy,
                        and Air Force concur in this memorandum.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The Executive Committee of the Committee of Principals has developed and
                        evaluated a U.S. proposal for Strategic Arms Limitation for discussion with
                        the Soviets (Tab A). The recommended proposal would prohibit the initiation
                        of further deployments of offensive strategic missile systems and limit the
                        deployment of ballistic missile defensive systems. No reductions in forces
                        would be called for, and qualitative improvements would be permitted. No
                        limitation would be placed on strategic aircraft or on defenses against
                        aircraft. The limitations in the proposal are proposed to be verified by
                        external means.</p>
                    <p>The Executive Committee has unanimously concurred in this proposal as a basis
                        for discussion with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. They have
                        concluded that within the terms of such an agreement the U.S. would be able
                        to:</p>
                    <p>a. maintain the U.S. deterrent posture;</p>
                    <p>b. leave the Soviet Government and world opinion in no doubt as to the
                        adequacy of the U.S. deterrent posture;</p>
                    <p>c. be confident within the terms of the agreement that our deterrent posture
                        could not be eroded by the action of the Soviet Union, or any other nuclear
                        power, alone or in combination;</p>
                    <p>d. maintain a U.S. capability to limit damage to the United States by Soviet
                        forces if deterrence fails, at least as effective as that which we can
                        expect to obtain in the absence of an agreement; and</p>
                    <p>e. provide a strategic capability that would prevent nuclear powers other
                        than the Soviet Union from threatening the stability of the agreement.</p>

                    <p>The elements of a U.S. proposal for the proposed U.S.-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> strategic missile talks are outlined
                        below. This proposal should be viewed as an entity since that is the basis

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Fixed Land-Based <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> Launchers</p>
                    <p>The proposal would require cessation of the initiation of construction of any

                        1, 1968. The Soviet Union would be permitted to complete the launchers which

                        be allowed to initiate further deployment of fixed <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers. Under no circumstances would either side be

                        Systems</p>
                    <p>The proposal would impose a complete ban on mobile land-based, strategic
                        offensive missile systems (ranges greater than 1,000 km). Missile systems
                        with such ranges carried by waterborne vehicles on inland waterways would
                        also be prohibited. Any such existing systems would be destroyed.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Mobile Sea-Based Strategic Offensive Missile
                        Systems</p>
                    <p>A. The proposal would ban the construction of additional strategic offensive
                        missile launching submarines or of additional launchers in existing
                        submarines. This prohibition should apply to all submarines with ballistic
                        missile or cruise missile launchers. Such submarines under construction as
                        of September 1, 1968, could be completed, subject to agreement on their
                        number. There would be no limitation on the characteristics of SLBMs or
                        SLCMs, or on retrofitting missile submarines with new or larger missiles of
                        the type with which they are equipped. The fitting out of surface ships with
                        facilities for firing offensive ballistic missiles would be prohibited.</p>
                    <p>B. There would be no replacement of ballistic or cruise missile submarines
                        within the first five years of the agreement. During that period the two
                        sides would undertake to reach agreement on rules governing subsequent
                        replacement of submarines. In the absence of a supplementary agreement on
                        such rules, each side may replace submarines after <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0712"/>five years from the date of the initiation
                        of the agreement provided that replacement does not increase the total
                        number of submarines or of submarine-launched ballistic missiles or cruise
                        missiles.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s</p>
                    <p>The proposal would ban the deployment of more than a set and equivalent
                        number of fixed, land-based anti-ballistic missile launchers and associated
                        anti-ballistic missiles including reload missiles. A total prohibition on
                        deployment of mobile <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems, both
                        land-based and sea-based, would be imposed. There would be no other
                        constraints on the characteristics of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems deployed.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. Aircraft and Anti-aircraft Systems</p>
                    <p>The proposal would not include limitations on aircraft or anti-aircraft
                        systems.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VII. Technological Improvements</p>
                    <p>There would be no prohibition of technological improvement within the
                        constraints of the agreement.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VIII. Verification</p>
                    <p>The limitations described in paragraphs I through V are proposed to be
                        verified by external means.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">IX. Provisions for Revision and Withdrawal</p>
                    <p>A. Either party may propose revision of the agreement if it believes that
                        conditions affecting the agreement have changed. The two parties shall meet
                        from time to time to discuss the operation of the agreement and possible
                        revisions.</p>
                    <p>B. Nine years after entry into force of this agreement the two parties shall
                        meet for a formal review of the operation of the agreement with a view to
                        assuring that the purposes of the agreement, with any revisions that may
                        have been made during the period, are being realized. In the absence of
                        agreement by the two parties on the continued operation of the agreement
                        with necessary revisions, either party may withdraw by giving six months'
                        notice prior to ten years from the day of entry into force of the agreement.
                        Otherwise, the agreement shall be automatically renewed for another ten
                        years, at which time this review procedure shall be repeated.</p>
                    <p>C. Either party shall in exercising its national sovereignty have the right
                        to withdraw from the agreement at any time if it decides that extraordinary
                        events, related to the subject matter of the agreement, have jeopardized the
                        supreme interests of its country.</p>

                        <item>Strategic Arms Talks with the Soviets</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The proposed strategic missile limitation agreement which has been concurred
                        in by the Executive Committee of the Committee of Principals, would, if
                        successfully negotiated, be demonstrably in the net interest of the United
                        States and, we believe, in the interest of the Soviet Union as well. By
                        imposing limitations on the numbers of strategic offensive and defensive
                        missiles which each side could deploy, the proposed agreement would contain
                        the strategic arms competition and avert a likely dangerous and costly new
                        spiral in the arms race between the two superpowers.</p>
                    <p>The achievement of such an agreement would also demonstrate to others the
                        common determination of the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to fulfill their obligations under Article VI of the
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty and thus contribute to the goal of preventing
                        proliferation of nuclear weapons to additional countries. It would increase
                        the chances of reaching more comprehensive agreements involving reductions
                        in strategic arms and, hopefully, facilitate agreement on other bilateral
                        and multilateral arms control measures.</p>
                    <p>The agreement could be a major factor in reducing the risks of the outbreak
                        of nuclear war and in promoting a meaningful detente. Above all, an
                        agreement between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of
                        this nature could profoundly alter the complexion of East-West relationships
                        and provide a climate wherein cooperative efforts could be directed toward
                        solving other critical world problems.</p>
                    <p>The agreement would specifically enhance strategic stability between the U.S.
                        and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> because of two primary
                        factors:</p>
                    <p>1. Each side would retain a secure deterrent force, with minimum incentive
                        for launching a first strike in times of crises;</p>
                    <p>2. The foundation would be laid for a continuing exchange of views on
                        strategic matters, thus helping to avert the mutual suspicions and
                        overreactions which have characterized the past strategic situation.</p>
                    <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0714"/>
                    <p>The effect of the proposed agreement on the strategic balance should be
                        compared with the future strategic environment which is most likely to
                        prevail in the absence of such an agreement. Without the constraints imposed
                        by the agreement, we estimate that the Soviet Union, by the middle 1970's,
                        could have deployed at least 1,500 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s,
                        a submarine-launched ballistic missile fleet comparable to our present
                        Polaris force, some new land-mobile offensive missiles, and an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system containing almost three times as
                        many interceptor missiles as the planned U.S. Sentinel system. The Soviets
                        are, of course, capable of deploying a strategic force even larger and more
                        powerful.</p>
                    <p>While our presently programmed strategic forces are adequate to cope with the
                        probable future Soviet threat, we might be obliged to procure substantial
                        qualitative and quantitative additions to maintain our deterrent if we were
                        to see signs that the Soviets were moving towards more extensive offensive
                        and defensive programs.</p>
                    <p>If, however, the agreement were acceptable to the Soviet Union, Soviet
                        strategic forces would be constrained in four important ways:</p>
                    <p>1. The rapid recent expansion of Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        deployments would be halted at numbers of launchers essentially equal to the
                        U.S.;</p>
                    <p>2. The number of new-generation Soviet Polaris-type submarines would be held
                        to a level well below half of the U.S. force;</p>
                    <p>3. The otherwise very likely deployment of Soviet land-mobile <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s would be precluded;</p>
                    <p>4. The level of Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s would be limited
                        to an equivalent of a U.S. deployment.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, the proposed agreement, if accepted in its present form,
                        would have no significant effect on present U.S. plans regarding strategic
                        weapons systems. We would still have the options of going ahead with the
                        current programmed improvements in our capabilities, including advanced
                        offensive missiles with <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>'s (Poseidon
                        and Minuteman III). However, with the constraints placed on Soviet strategic
                        forces under the proposed agreement, the United States would not have to
                        procure major new strategic offensive systems, or an extensive <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system, in order to maintain an adequate
                        deterrent.</p>
                    <p>Although we consider that limitations on radars for <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems is a most significant item in dealing with the
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> question, the present proposal does
                        not provide any such limitation because of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> concern over possible erroneous categorization of radars. The
                        Executive Committee agreed that the problems of limitations on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> radars and the relationship of radars to
                        preventing the upgrading of the Tallinn antiaircraft system to provide it
                        with a significant <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability must be
                        studied further and will have to be among the subjects discussed with the
                        Soviets during the negotiations.</p>
                    <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0715"/>
                    <p>Because of the strategic situation which would exist under the agreement,
                        both our absolute and relative strategic deterrent posture vis-a-vis the
                        Soviet Union or any other nuclear power or combinations thereof—in terms of
                        our assured destruction and damage-limitation criteria—would be at least as
                        good as, and in many circumstances considerably better than, would probably
                        be the case in the absence of an agreement.</p>
                    <p>The United States Intelligence Board has prepared a Special National
                        Intelligence Estimate which evaluates our external capabilities; i.e., those
                        that do not depend upon agreed access to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, to verify strategic arms control agreements. Using external
                        means alone, we have in some instances very high confidence of detecting
                        Soviet violations at an early state; in all others, we are confident of
                        detecting violations well before they could measurably alter the strategic
                        balance. In those areas where our capabilities are lowest, it would still be
                        in our interest to propose limitations since potential violations would not
                        significantly affect our security and the limitations would provide
                        inhibitions to Soviet actions which they might otherwise freely undertake if
                        no agreement existed.</p>
                    <p>Thus, we conclude that our ability to verify the agreement by external means
                        alone is adequate, even taking into account the margin of uncertainty in
                        some of our external verification capabilities and our need for adequate
                        safeguards against possible Soviet violation or abrogation. This is
                        reinforced by the fact that the agreement would not affect present U.S.
                        programs but would constrain Soviet forces below the threat levels used to
                        justify these programs. Therefore, we estimate that the potential risks to
                        our deterrent due to possible Soviet evasion of the terms of the agreement
                        are less serious than the risks we would face in the absence of an
                        agreement. All of this, however, does not exclude the possibility of probing
                        Soviet receptivity to a supplementary verification arrangement which would
                        increase confidence in the viability of the agreement.</p>
                    <p>No agreement dealing with the extraordinarily complicated question of
                        limiting strategic armaments can be initially designed to solve all possible
                        problems which could arise from technological or political changes which may
                        occur after the agreement is reached. Recognizing this, the proposed
                        agreement allows for mutually agreeable revisions to be made to the basic
                        agreement in order to preserve its stability and satisfy the security
                        interests of each party. It also contains a withdrawal provision in the
                        event that one side comes to believe that its vital security interests have
                        become endangered by the agreement. It may also be desirable to create some
                        bilateral consultative machinery to ensure the viability of the agreement on
                        a day-to-day basis.</p>

                    <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName>:</p>
                    <p>The proposed memorandum for the President concerning Arms Control on the
                        Seabed has been reviewed within the Department of Defense.<note n="2" xml:id="d270fn2">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                            sent a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> on
                            July 31, requesting his concurrence on an attached memorandum to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> seeking
                            Presidential approval of a proposed statement on arms control of the
                            seabed to be made by the U.S. Representative to the upcoming conference
                            of the U.N. Ad Hoc Committee on the Seabed at Rio de Janeiro. The
                            memorandum also provided rationale for the proposed statement. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> forwarded the memorandum to
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff for comment; they responded with a memorandum
                            to <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> (<gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>-497-68), August 10. These documents
                            are ibid.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I agree that there may be serious disadvantages in a United States refusal to
                        be forthcoming on the issue of peaceful purposes. The Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        concur in this view. However, we have certain difficulties with the specific
                        arms control proposal set forth in the draft formulation of a U.S. statement
                        on this subject. I am therefore enclosing an alternative draft statement
                        incorporating some changes which I believe will cover the concerns expressed
                        in the discussion portion of the draft memorandum while affording more
                        adequate protection for the national security interest.<note n="3" xml:id="d270fn3">Tab A.</note>

                    <p>I am in general agreement with the discussion which supports the proposal.
                        The Joint Chiefs of Staff have suggested some changes in paragraphs 5 and 6
                        of this section which will more accurately reflect their previously
                        expressed views. I agree with these suggested changes so they are also
                            attached.<note n="4" xml:id="d270fn4">Tab B.</note>

                    <p>That, during the August 19-30 meeting of the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee
                        on the Seabed, the United States Representative be authorized to state:</p>
                    <p>“The United States supports the adoption of a General Assembly resolution
                        declaring that the seabed and deep ocean floor should be used exclusively
                        for peaceful purposes. The United States has previously supported, in the
                        Space Treaty of 1967, the use exclusively for peaceful purposes of the moon
                        and other celestial bodies. As we said then we understand that the test of
                        whether an activity is 'peaceful' is whether it is consistent with the
                        United Nations Charter and other obligations of international law.</p>
                    <p>“We believe it is important to prevent the spread of the arms race to new
                        environments. It is appropriate that the General Assembly should go on
                        record in support of <hi rend="italic">this proposition as the Assembly
                            addresses itself to the future use of the seabed and deep ocean

                            floor should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes</hi>. <hi rend="italic">It is evident that preventing the spread of the arms
                            race to this new environment requires meaningful and effective measures
                            of arms control, and to that end the careful elaboration of legal
                            instruments taking the form of an international agreement. There must
                            obviously be reliable and effective means for verifying compliance with

                            require the negotiation of a detailed arms control agreement</hi>.</p>

                    <p>“5. The Joint Chiefs of Staff understandably have been concerned about the
                        question of verification of a ban on seabed emplacement of nuclear weapons.
                        On 27 April 1968, they stated that the United States did not have a
                        verification capability.<note n="7" xml:id="d270fn7">
                            <ref target="#d236">Document 236</ref>.</note> They also stated that
                        they did not believe that any nation had such a capability. However, this
                        issue is now under intensive study by the intelligence community. In any
                        event, during discussions in the ENDC there will be a full opportunity to
                        investigate the problems of verification and to satisfy ourselves as to how
                        they will be handled before we enter into new treaty commitments.”</p>

                        nuclear weapons system in this environment should remain open. Should
                        technological developments by the United States make this option feasible,
                        the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe the use of the deep ocean bottom would be
                        more advantageous to the United States than to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Paragraph 3 of the recommended statement uses the

                        was carefully formulated so as not to foreclose any military options
                        prematurely. We have taken action to reassure our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies that it is not our intention to foreclose this
                        option but only to define those factors vital to the consideration of an
                        agreement in this area. The definition of these factors, along with the
                        progress made in the strategic missile talks to which a seabed agreement is
                        a logical corollary, may determine whether an agreement in this area should

                    <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                    <p>To estimate the capabilities of US intelligence to monitor a ban on the
                        emplacement of weapons of mass destruction on the seabed—defined as the
                        ocean floor outside territorial waters—and to estimate the likelihood <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0720"/>of Soviet or third country
                        deployment of such weapons, during the next 10 years or so.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Scope</p>
                    <p>For the purposes of this estimate, the following types of weapons are assumed
                        to be prohibited:</p>
                    <p>a. Manned or unmanned installations containing nuclear weapons or missiles,
                        encapsulated nuclear missiles, and nuclear mines, resting on, anchored to,
                        or imbedded in the seabed.</p>
                    <p>b. Nuclear weapon systems designed to operate primarily on the seabed but
                        having the characteristic of mobility.</p>
                    <p>While chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction could theoretically
                        be emplaced on the seabed, the problems of their detection and
                        identification would be the same as in the case of nuclear weapons.
                        Likewise, the considerations affecting intent would be virtually the same.
                        Hence in this estimate, only nuclear weapons are specifically discussed.</p>
                    <p>Mobile strategic offensive and defensive weapon systems of mass destruction
                        whose principal object is to make use of the seas, as opposed to the seabed,
                        are assumed not to be banned and are, therefore, beyond the scope of this
                        estimate. Neither will the temporary anchorage of ships or submarines to the
                        seabed, whether for emergency purposes, for purposes incident to navigation,
                        for purposes of avoiding detection, or for preparations to launch missiles,
                        be considered in this estimate.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. We believe that neither the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> nor any
                        other country would, during the period of this estimate, deploy weapons of
                        mass destruction on the seabed in violation of an agreement banning such
                        deployment. If any signatory decided that it could no longer tolerate the
                        restrictions imposed by the agreement, we believe that it would abrogate the
                        agreement openly rather than try secret evasion, probably after making
                        covert preparations for the prohibited emplacement in advance of the
                        announcement.</p>
                    <p>B. The time required for detection and verification of a violation would vary
                        with the nature, size, and location of the prohibited deployment. It would
                        be difficult for us to identify a seabed weapon system as such prior to
                        deployment. Detection of predeployment activity, however, and of support
                        systems and activities associated with installation, checkout, maintenance,
                        resupply, and command and control, would arouse our suspicions and would
                        probably lead to eventual detection and identification of the prohibited
                        deployment.</p>
                    <p>C. We believe that deployment under the open ocean would be detected before a

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. General Considerations</p>
                    <p>1. In assessing our ability to monitor an agreement of the sort being
                        considered here, it must be remembered that we are dealing with the
                        development and deployment of radically new weapon systems, the
                        characteristics of which we can only imagine on the basis of our knowledge
                        of relevant US and Soviet technology. Essentially, we are faced with
                        consideration of two general types of weapon systems. The first would employ
                        a missile deployed on the seabed and launched to a distant target. Such a
                        system would be highly sophisticated and would use new technology and new
                        methods of operation and control. The other type would consist of a nuclear
                        weapon emplaced on the seabed near its intended target to be exploded
                        without ejection from the water, in the nature of a mine. The
                        characteristics of any such systems would be much different from the
                        characteristics of those weapon systems upon which our past monitoring
                        experience is based. In this respect, any judgments which we make with
                        respect to our capability to monitor a seabed weapons agreement must
                        necessarily be tentative.</p>
                    <p>2. Our regular sources of intelligence information—SIGINT, overhead
                        photography, and human sources—would be a significant part of our detection
                        capabilities [<hi rend="italic">5 lines of source text not

                    <p rend="center">AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">DOBRYNIN</persName> OF
                        THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>In a relaxed and extensive informal talk with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on the evening of Thursday, August
                        15th, the following points emerged:</p>
                    <p>1. I pointed out that the alternatives which we had suggested as to the level
                        at which offensive-defensive missile talks might begin were for the purpose
                        of making a prompt reply by the Soviet Union somewhat easier if our original
                        suggestion had caused complications. The alternatives were given in a rough
                        order of priority as far as our own choices were concerned. The Ambassador
                        said that he might have a reply on the 16th or 17th because the Soviet
                        leadership has its meetings usually on Thursdays—similar to our Tuesday
                        luncheons at the White House. I told him that I thought there would be
                        advantage in our being able to announce the time and place of such talks
                        before the convening of the Non-Nuclear Weapons Conference later this month
                        in Geneva.<note n="2" xml:id="d272fn2">Regarding this conference, see <ref target="#d263fn3">footnote 3, Document 263</ref>, and <ref target="#d284">Documents 284</ref> and <ref target="#d286">286</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. On the substance of the offensive-defensive missile talks, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> reflected great earnestness in the
                        importance of the talks and the seriousness with which he considered the
                        subject. I told him that I thought that these talks might well be the most
                        important talks between our two countries since World War II—and he agreed.
                        He asked about our Poseidon and Minute Man Tests and I told him that it was
                        not possible for us to proceed on the basis that we already had an agreement
                        prior to reaching one. I said that these tests have been laid on for a long,
                        long time and that the timing was not connected in any way with the timing
                        of discussions. He seemed quite relaxed on this point.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of Vietnam, Czechoslovakia, and recent Soviet
                        contacts with Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> and

                    <p>6. I reminded the Ambassador that he had telephoned me last week expressing
                        concern about the Euratom countries entering a “reservation” at the time of
                        signing the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. I told him that my
                        information was that these countries did not intend to enter a “reservation
                        but were stating that the timing of the ratification of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> on their part would be related to an
                        agreement between Euratom and <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> on

                        discussion with the Soviets. The proposal has been unanimously agreed upon
                        by the Committee of Principals (<persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>,

                    <p>In the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> review, Generals <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>, Westmoreland, and McConnell
                        concurred in the proposal as submitted to you; however, Admiral Moore and
                        General Chapman recommended certain modifications favorable to the Navy that
                        were not acceptable to the other Chiefs. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Paul

                        intelligence capabilities to monitor such an agreement, which is a critical
                        issue in evaluating this proposal.</p>
                    <p>This proposal represents the coordinated effort of the community to define a
                        reasonable package, which might be negotiable with the Soviets, within the
                        following basic ground-rule: that the agreement be verifiable by external
                        means alone to the extent necessary to protect U.S. security interests; that
                        is, it goes as far as we can safely go without on-the-ground inspection.</p>
                    <p>Although there is now agreement that the proposal is in a form that can be
                        discussed with the Soviets, there are still certain important unresolved
                        features of the proposal and underlying issues of which you should be aware:</p>
                    <p>—The most important unresolved aspect of the proposal is the level of
                        limitations that would be placed on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        deployments. Our present position calls only for a “set and equivalent
                        number” of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> launchers, and we have not
                        yet agreed internally on a preferred number. Our final decision will be
                        influenced by the Soviet position on this subject.</p>
                    <p>—Closely related to this is the very difficult underlying intelligence
                        problem of how we should deal with the Tallinn <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> system in defining its present capabilities and controlling
                        future upgrading that might give it some <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        capability. While it is agreed that the relationship of radars to this
                        question will have to be studied further and discussed with the Soviets, it
                        is not yet agreed precisely how this should be handled and whether it should
                        be formally dealt with in an agreement.</p>
                    <p>—There are also difficult tactical problems yet to be resolved, such as how
                        to deal with “on-site inspections” in the proposal. Although the proposal
                        has been developed on the assumption that it could be monitored by external
                        means alone, there is no question that on-site inspection would be very
                        helpful in building mutual confidence and greatly help unresolved issues
                        such as those presented by the Tallinn system. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have asked that an effort be made to include on-site
                        inspection in the agreement we finally reach with the Soviets. How this can
                        be done effectively with any chance of success without jeopardizing the
                        prospects for the talks presents a major challenge to our negotiators. The
                        community is now working on basic instructions for the negotiating
                        delegation which will deal with this and other tactical problems.</p>
                    <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0725"/>
                    <p>As I noted earlier, I believe that the preparation of this proposal is an
                        example of intra-governmental cooperation at its best. If the talks prove
                        fruitful, we will face many difficult issues that can only be successfully
                        resolved if this cooperative attitude is sustained.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that you tentatively approve the proposal as a basis for
                        additional preparations for the talks, subject to a meeting with the
                        Principals as soon as we obtain agreement from the Soviets on the nature and

                    <p>During the summer months of 1968, U.S. and Soviet principals explored the
                        possibility of a summit meeting between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. Following the signing of the

                        privately explored the possibility and timing of such a meeting which, they
                        agreed, might focus particularly on the strategic missile talks. (Memorandum

                        leaders in Leningrad in early October and also suggested the text of the

                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> proposed that the missile talks
                        might open in Geneva on September 30 and suggested the text of an
                        announcement of the talks. (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>In a memorandum to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>,
                        August 20, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> wrote: “The
                        agreement announced this morning that the President will confer with leaders
                        within the Soviet Union in early October is the outcome <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0726"/>of a long process,” and he proceeded to
                        provide a detailed summary of the background of the steps leading to the
                        anticipated summit meeting between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. He provided all this information to <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> “for your and my backgrounders
                        tomorrow,” presumably to brief the press on the upcoming summit meeting.
                        (Johnson Library, National Security File, Rostow Files, “Trip to Soviet
                        Union,” Box 11) No announcement of a summit meeting on August 20 has been
                        found, but Rostow apparently meant a public announcement the following
                        morning.</p>
                    <p> Rostow concluded his August 20 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, as follows:</p>
                    <p>“Although the opening of the strategic missile talks was probably a catalyst
                        that led to this decision by the two Governments, the meeting of President
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> will undoubtedly be the occasion to
                        consult on:</p>
                    <p>—a variety of bilateral matters;</p>
                    <p>—next steps in the implementation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty;</p>
                    <p>—the possibilities of bringing our positions closer on the Middle East and on
                        Vietnam.”</p>
                    <p>With the military invasion of Czechoslovakia by Soviet and other Warsaw Pact
                        troops on the night of August 20-21, however, the proposed summit meeting
                        was put on hold. At a meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House at
                        8:15–8:42 p.m. on August 20, which Dobrynin requested, the Soviet Ambassador
                        informed President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> of the military
                        intervention. At this meeting nothing was said to indicate that the summit
                        would not be announced as planned. But at a hastily summoned meeting of the
                        National Security Council from 10:15–11:10 p.m., it was agreed that the
                        summit announcement would be delayed indefinitely and that Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> would summon <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> to his office to tell him about
                        the postponement of the summit announcement and to raise the
                        administration's concerns about the military incursion into Czechoslovakia.

                    <p>1. It was agreed that hereafter the term “national” means of verification
                        would be used in place of “unilateral” or “external.” An explanation of this
                        term should be prepared and consideration given as to informing the Soviets
                        of our understanding of its meaning.</p>
                    <p>2. Paragraph 7 on page 3 of the Basic Position Paper (<gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>-3009/Rev. 2, August 20, 1968, which was
                        attached to Reference 1 above) was revised as follows:</p>
                    <p>“7. After an exchange of initial views on <hi rend="italic">the proposed
                            force limitations</hi>, the Delegation should explore the problem of
                        verification. The U.S. proposal has been drawn up on the assumption that in
                        each instance we could agree to exclusive reliance on <hi rend="italic">national</hi> means of verification. We should first, however, make a
                        concerted effort to gain Soviet agreement to additional means of providing
                        reassurance. Specifically, we should propose that both sides agree to
                        arrangements for supplementary procedures involving agreed procedures for
                        selective direct observation on Soviet and U.S. territory for those
                        restrictions which cannot otherwise be verified with high confidence. The
                        delegation should concentrate its efforts on those items for which
                        supplementary procedures will be demonstrably useful in increasing the
                        confidence that the agreement is being complied with. <hi rend="italic">This
                            concept should be pursued during these portions of the negotiation, but
                            not to the extent of prejudicing the negotiations or precluding, if so
                            instructed, reliance solely on national means of verification</hi>. The
                            <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0728"/>delegation should also explore
                        other means of providing reassurance. (Studies are underway to define these
                        items and procedures, and the results will be made available to the
                        delegation.)”</p>
                    <p>3. Paragraph V-4 on page 14 was revised as follows:</p>
                    <p>“4. The Soviet Union has been widely deploying a strategic air defense system
                        called the SA-5 or Tallinn system. It is generally agreed in the U.S.
                        Intelligence Community that the Tallinn system does not at present have an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> (except possibly for a limited
                        self-defense capability, such as the Nike-Hercules or any other air-defense
                        missile). However, since it is conceivable that it could be augmented and
                        converted to acquire such a capability, a discussion of the capabilities and
                        purposes of this system would be in order. <hi rend="italic">The delegation
                            should seek to elicit information on the Tallinn system to assure us
                            that it is not and will not be upgraded into an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. Our main aim would be to satisfy ourselves that
                            the Tallinn system is not and will not be upgraded into an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system without our knowledge. If we
                            cannot satisfy ourselves on this matter, then Tallinn launchers must
                                be<note n="5" xml:id="d275fn5">Subsequent to the meeting, it was
                                agreed to insert “limited and” after “must be” in line 5. [Footnote
                                in the source text.]</note> included in the agreed Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> level</hi>. As a means of gaining
                        assurance regarding Tallinn, we should raise the question of radars and
                        attempt to obtain as part of an understanding that replacement of the
                        Tallinn site radars, for example, would be prohibited if Tallinn is to be
                        treated as air defense.”</p>
                    <p>4. The Secretary of State recommended that consideration be given to
                        modifying Paragraph X-1 on page 22 as follows:</p>
                    <p>“1. Discussion of the form that an agreement might take should be deferred
                        until we have a clearer picture of what such an agreement might cover. Any
                        agreement should be sufficiently explicit to minimize subsequent possible
                        misunderstandings. <hi rend="italic">Although it is normal practice to
                            embody disarmament agreements in treaty form, other forms of agreement
                            should not be excluded at this time</hi>.”<note n="6" xml:id="d275fn6">Subsequent to the meeting, it was agreed to delete second sentence of
                            proposed paragraph X-1 and insert the following sentence at the end:
                            “Should the Soviets raise the subject, the Delegation should seek
                            instructions.” [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>5. No comments were made on the other changes agreed and recommended by the
                        Working Group in its memorandum of August 22, 1968 (<gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>-3011).</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> opened the meeting by
                        pointing out that the question of going ahead with the talks and the timing
                        were now obviously uncertain as a result of the Czechoslovak situation.<note n="7" xml:id="d275fn7">See <ref target="#d274">Document
                        274</ref>.</note> However, it was not the purpose of the Executive Committee
                        meeting to consider that, but to give to the President the necessary
                        material to permit him to go ahead with the talks if and when he desired.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> reported that, as a result
                        of a suggestion by the Defense Department, the Working Group had met in the
                        morning and prepared <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0729"/>some revisions
                        to the draft Initial Presentation and Basic Position Paper previously
                        forwarded to the Executive Committee (Reference 1). With the exception of
                        the four items covered in the memorandum from the Working Group to the
                        Executive Committee (Reference 2), the Working Group agreed on all other
                        changes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> then discussed point No. 1
                        of Reference 2 dealing with what term to use to describe certain
                        verification methods. It was pointed out that in previous correspondence
                        with the Soviets the terms “unilateral” and “national” had been used, and
                        that there was some worry that inserting a new word might confuse the
                        Soviets. Mr. Rostow suggested that a word be picked, and then the delegation
                        establish a legislative record in the talks with the Soviets on the meaning
                        of the word, including reference to observations from satellites. Mr. Foster
                        pointed out that the Soviets might object to any formal understanding on
                        this point, although they had already agreed tacitly. Mr. Rostow thought
                        that in this critical case it might be desirable to get a formal
                        understanding. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>
                        stated a preference for either “unilateral” or “national” over the word
                        “external” which had been agreed upon at the last meeting. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he was quite willing to
                        return to the term “national” and that it might be useful to have an
                        explanation of the meaning of the term.</p>
                    <p>With reference to point No. 2 of Reference 2 relative to negotiating
                        instructions on the subject of verification, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> stated that discussion had centered on the degree to
                        which the delegation should push for supplementary inspection procedures.
                        With the exception of the Department of State representative, all members of
                        the Working Group had agreed with the underlined wording proposed in
                        paragraph No. 2 of Reference 2.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> stated that in his view
                        the negotiations might proceed as follows: First, a general discussion of
                        verification in which the desirability of supplementary verification
                        procedures would be placed in the record on a low-key basis. Secondly, the
                        discussions would then turn to the details of the items to be limited. After
                        these had been agreed upon, the discussion would proceed to verification
                        required for each of the specific items. He felt that to ensure
                        Congressional support for any agreement it would be necessary to make it
                        clear that we had pressed for that verification which we believed to be
                        useful, if not essential. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName>
                        pointed out that we would have to be careful not to give the impression to
                        the Senate that the Soviets had talked us out of something that was
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Brown felt we should not press vigorously for on-site inspection as
                        a principle, but push for specific cases (e.g., Tallinn) where one could
                        justify that supplementary procedures would significantly improve confidence
                        that the agreement was being complied with. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> thought that the inclusion of
                        the words “vigorously” <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0730"/>and
                        “fallback” in the proposed instruction might be too strong and suggested
                        deleting “vigorously” and modifying the final clause as follows:
                        “precluding, if so instructed, reliance solely on national means of
                        verification.” The Executive Committee agreed with this substitute
                        formulation.</p>
                    <p>With respect to paragraph No. 3 on instructions re the Tallinn system, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> pointed out that two
                        alternative formulations had been put forth by the representatives of <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> on
                        the one hand and by State and <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> on the
                        other. He pointed out that there were two basic differences of views: (1)
                        should we seek assurances that the Tallinn is not now an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system in view of the agreed intelligence
                        analysis which had already received considerable publicity that it was not
                        an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system; and (2) should we consider
                        the Tallinn launchers and missiles to be included in the agreed Soviet ABM
                        limitations if assurances could not be received that they would be upgraded,
                        or only at such a point as we believed they had been upgraded? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> stated that no one in the
                        Intelligence Community really thought that the Tallinn system was now an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system, but there were some who
                        thought it might be upgraded to become one. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> agreed that the present deployment
                        was against aircraft, but that it might have a self-defense capability
                        against missiles. Furthermore, if a Dog House were added, it could have
                        increased <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capabilities and was therefore
                        now an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> stated that if it were hooked up
                        to Hen-House, which would be impossible to determine, then they could have
                        some <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability today. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> asked whether the Soviets informing
                        us that it was not an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> would satisfy us.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said it might be
                        useful for them to tell us this, and Secretary Brown said there might be
                        some questions which could be answered which would give us increased
                        confidence.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> stated that he was not
                        in favor of an agreement which justified very large numbers of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s. One of the purposes of the discussions
                        was to try to limit <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s to a low value. He
                        did not like to see an agreement which allowed several thousand <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s on each side just because we could not
                        obtain any greater assurance than we have already that Tallinn was not an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> thought they might give us some
                        interesting information on radars, but Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> pointed out that, at the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>' recommendation, we were not limiting radars. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said we would have to if we
                        were to prevent upgrading. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked the status of the Working Group studies on radars,
                        and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> stated that the
                        Working Group had nothing to report at this time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> pointed out that page 15 of the
                        proposed instruction directed the delegation to raise the question of radars
                        and to attempt to obtain an understanding that replacement of the
                        Tallinn-type radars would be forbidden. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> said he understood that the Tallinn system was of
                        little value without new radars. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> agreed, but said we were not stopping radars. Secretary
                        Brown pointed out that it was not the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>'s
                        objective to have an agreement which <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0731"/>allowed large numbers of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s, but only
                        to provide a lever to get information from the Soviets which would increase
                        our confidence that the Tallinn system was not an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>. He also pointed out that since the Tallinn's effectiveness
                        as an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> would, in any case, be very low,
                        the equivalence between Tallinn missiles and Sentinel missiles would not
                        need to be on a one-for-one basis.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked whether we would
                        be in favor of an agreement that banned all <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s if the Soviets offered this. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> said not necessarily, since we had
                        to worry about China. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>
                        said it might be in our interest, but that was not obvious at this time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName> pointed out that we should
                        keep in mind that the Soviets are likely to raise Nike-Hercules as the
                        counterpart of the Tallinn system and that it might be difficult, even
                        though we were presumably willing to disclose information on Nike-H, to
                        prove to the Soviets that it was not tied in to the Sentinel system. There
                        was no intention to sweep the problems of the Tallinn system under the rug,
                        and he did not believe that any of the proposed wordings did this. Mr.
                        Rostow pointed out that the Tallinn problem would be the first test case of
                        our ability to obtain adequate assurances from the Soviets. Situations will
                        undoubtedly arise on many occasions during the negotiations and after any
                        agreement is in effect.</p>
                    <p>After considerable discussion of alternate language to follow the third
                        sentence of paragraph 4 on page 14 of the Basic Position Paper, it was
                        agreed that the following sentences would be inserted: “The delegation
                        should seek to elicit information on the Tallinn system to assure us that it
                        is not and will not be upgraded into an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        system. Our main aim would be to satisfy ourselves that the Tallinn system
                        is not and will not be upgraded into an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        system without our knowledge. If we cannot satisfy ourselves on this matter,
                        then Tallinn launchers must be<note n="8" xml:id="d275fn8">Subsequent to the
                            meeting, it was agreed to insert “limited and” after “must be”.
                            [Footnote in the source text.]</note> included in the agreed Soviet
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> level.”</p>
                    <p>With respect to item 4 on the Instructions re the form of the agreement,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> stated that he could
                        not accept any language which committed us to a formal treaty at this time,
                        even though this might turn out to be the form when the agreement had been
                        reached. He suggested that the following sentence be inserted at the end of
                        paragraph X-1 on page 22 of the Basic Position Paper: “Although it is normal
                        practice to embody disarmament agreements in treaty form, other forms of
                        agreement should not be excluded at this time.” There was only a limited
                        discussion of this suggestion, and it was agreed that the Working Group
                        would see if this suggestion would be satisfactory.</p>

                    <p>2. (S) The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed this draft “Interim Report”
                        and have concluded that:</p>
                    <p>a. It is impossible to determine by the systems analysis approach when and if
                        a cutoff would be to the net interest of the United States. The
                        uncertainties in parameters and multiple scenarios possible in a study of
                        this type do not permit conclusions of sufficient validity and certainty to
                        provide a basis for prudent national security decisions. Areas of these <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697" facs="0733"/>uncertainties in parameters include
                        30 to 40 percent possible error in intelligence estimates of Soviet
                        cumulative production, similar uncertainties as to the amount of fissionable
                        material that the Soviets plan to use in their weapons, effectiveness of the
                        Soviet's <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, yield and accuracy of their
                        offensive missiles, and which of many possible options they are likely to
                        select for weapon allocation. Examples of possible variations in scenarios
                        that have not yet been considered include pindown attacks, employment of
                        fractional orbit bombardment systems, and limitations on strategic offensive
                        and defensive systems.</p>
                    <p>b. The study highlights the tremendous complexity and uncertainties
                        associated with attempting to determine precise weapon requirements and
                        associated fissionable material. Because of this complexity and the
                        conservatism appropriate to decisions involving the national security of the
                        United States, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that the study be
                        terminated and the future primary criterion for determining the feasibility
                        of a cutoff be the adequacy of the fissionable material available at the
                        time of cutoff to meet the Nation's forecast weapon requirements.</p>
                    <p>3. (S) The Joint Chiefs of Staff have also reviewed the reference, which
                        proposes a revision of the US position on cutoff of production of
                        fissionable material and transfer to peaceful uses. Primarily, this proposed
                        revision would result in a changed US position on verification of adversary
                        nuclear production facilities. This proposed amendment would result in a
                        verification procedure similar to that of the Nonproliferation Treaty;
                        namely, International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards for verification of
                        declared production and operating facilities and unilateral intelligence for
                        the discovery and verification of undeclared facilities. Although the United
                        States has the capability to detect with high confidence any facilities
                        large enough or numerous enough to make a significant addition to the large
                        amounts of fissionable materials already in the Soviet stockpile, the type
                        and rate of production cannot be determined accurately. The Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff do not object to the procedure proposed in the reference, provided the
                        United States is prepared to exercise immediately its right of withdrawal
                        from the agreement in the event of detection of clandestine facilities and
                        without compromise of US detection methods. Acceptance of this modification
                        regarding verification is germane only if, at some future date, a decision
                        is reached that a cutoff would be in national security interests.</p>
                    <p>4. (S) The 2 July <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> proposal states, “The
                        other aspects of the U.S. position on this measure would remain as we have
                        previously described them in Geneva.” To assure a clear understanding by the
                            <gloss target="#t_COP1">COP</gloss> as to what the US position is on the
                        “other aspects,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that, if <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> desires to pursue any aspects of the
                        subject proposal, it develop a position paper for the <gloss target="#t_COP1">COP</gloss> which would consolidate and define all
                        aspects of this proposal. The remarks in the <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0734"/>Appendix hereto<note n="4" xml:id="d276fn4">Entitled

                        of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the US position that is reflected in

                    </p>
                    <p>5. (S) In summary, the Joint Chiefs of Staff:</p>
                    <p>a. Recommend that the study being performed by the interagency working group
                        to determine if and when a cutoff of production of fissionable material
                        would be to the net advantage of the United States be terminated and that in
                        the future the criterion for determining the feasibility of a cutoff be the
                        adequacy of the available fissionable material at the time of cutoff to meet
                        forecast weapon requirements.</p>
                    <p>b. Do not object to the changed US position on verification providing the
                        United States is prepared to exercise immediately its right of withdrawal
                        from the agreement in the event of detection of clandestine facilities and
                        without compromise of US detection methods, if at some time in the future a
                        cutoff is clearly in the US national interest.</p>
                    <p>c. Oppose a cutoff of the production of fissionable materials for weapons as
                        it would not be in the national interest of the United States at this time.
                        If a cutoff had been effected in 1965, there would have been some
                        uncertainty as to its relative implications, but, on balance, the degree of
                        such uncertainty was sufficiently limited to permit an assessment of US
                        advantage within a reasonable margin of risk. Such is not the case at
                        present nor can such be forecast for the coming 5- to 10-year period. The
                        magnitude of uncertainties both as to weapon requirements and material
                        availability for both sides makes it impossible to rule out, with reasonable
                        risk, a potential for significant disadvantage to US interests in a cutoff
                        proposal. These many basic uncertainties are further compounded by
                        uncertainty related to possible strategic nuclear arms limitations
                        discussions with the Soviets. Until the prospects for, general outlines of,
                        and possible implications of such talks become more clear in the months to
                        come, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that a cutoff proposal would, at
                        best, be imprudent and could involve major risks to US security.</p>
                    <p>d. Prefer the United States not enter into a transfer to peaceful purposes
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>e. Do not oppose a demonstrated destruction of nuclear weapons agreement
                        provided:</p>
                    <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0735"/>
                    <p>(1) US weapons design and construction would not be compromised.</p>
                    <p>(2) Procedures would guarantee that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        was positively destroying nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>(3) An inspection and verification system is tested to assure feasibility and
                        practicality.</p>
                    <p>(4) Only weapons scheduled for retirement are destroyed.</p>
                    <p>f. Oppose a plant-by-plant shutdown.</p>
                    <p>g. Recommend, if <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> desires to pursue any
                        aspects of the subject proposal, that it develop a position paper for the
                        COP which would consolidate and define all aspects of this proposal.</p>

                        on the specific proposal, which was previously submitted to you with the

                    <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0736"/>
                    <p>The preparation and agreement on these papers are a further example of the
                        excellent intra-governmental cooperation that has been achieved on this
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>In view of the great importance of this proposal, I urge you to read the two
                        papers in their entirety.</p>
                    <p>I call your particular attention to the manner in which the difficult
                        question of verification is dealt with in the Initial Presentation, pages
                        6-7 (para. 12-14) and in the Position Paper, page 2 (para. 7). The basic
                        proposal has been developed on the basis that we could agree to rely
                        exclusively on verification by “national” means, which is now the agreed
                        term to describe all intelligence resources that do not involve direct
                        access to Soviet territory. However, in keeping with the desire of <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                        that an effort be made to obtain some inspection, the Initial Presentation
                        calls for consideration of procedures for “selective direct observation on
                        US and Soviet territory,” which is the new term for “on-site inspection,” as
                        a desirable means of increasing the confidence of each side in the
                        agreement. In the Position Paper, the delegation is instructed that “This
                        concept should be pursued during these portions of the negotiation, but not
                        to the extent of prejudicing the negotiations or precluding, if so
                        instructed, reliance solely on national means of verification.”</p>
                    <p>I also call your attention to the instructions to the delegation in the
                        Position Paper, pages 8-9 (para. 4) on how to handle the extremely difficult
                        and important issue of the Tallinn <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>
                        system. The resolution of this problem in the negotiations to our
                        satisfaction is central to the acceptability of the agreement. Moreover,
                        this can establish the necessary precedent for a continuing dialogue on how
                        to deal with suspicious or controversial problems which arise under an
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>You should also be aware of the question of the form of the agreement in the
                        Position Paper, page 14 (para. 1). Although there is complete agreement on
                        the instructions to the delegation to defer this issue, this bypasses a
                        substantive issue since the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> believe that
                        any agreement should be in the form of a treaty while Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> wishes to maintain the option for
                        consideration of less formal understandings.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that you tentatively approve these two papers as the basis for
                        further preparations for the talks.</p>

                    <p rend="center">STRATEGIC MISSILE TALKS</p>
                    <p rend="center">INITIAL PRESENTATION OF US POSITION</p>
                    <p>1. On behalf of my Government, I wish to express deep satisfaction that
                        representatives of the United States and the Soviet Socialist Republics are
                        now meeting to discuss the limitation and eventual reduction of both
                        offensive strategic nuclear weapons delivery systems and systems of defense
                        against ballistic missiles.</p>
                    <p>2. There is perhaps no more important step in the field of foreign relations
                        which our two Governments might take than to reach an agreement of this
                        kind. Such an agreement would enhance the security of both sides, could
                        permit each side to devote to peaceful endeavors substantial resources which
                        could be saved from future military expenditures, and would contribute to
                        world stability overall. It would also constitute a most important step in
                        fulfillment of the obligations undertaken by our Government under Article VI
                        of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Thus, early agreement between our two
                        countries would be of great value in increasing the likelihood that other
                        countries would ratify and adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
                    <p>3. The United States has presented to the Soviet Union over the past year and
                        a half several messages relating to the subject of these talks. It remains
                        the position of the United States Government that our discussions should
                        include both offensive strategic nuclear missile delivery systems and
                        systems of defense against ballistic missiles.</p>
                    <p>4. We believe that it is important, and should be possible, to reach
                        agreement on limited measures curbing the strategic arms race, without
                        resolving all of the difficult problems inevitably involved in a program for
                        general and complete disarmament. We believe that the first step in
                        achieving meaningful strategic arms limitations should be to restrain
                        further increases of strategic missile forces. Such a step would be of value
                        in avoiding a further costly and possibly dangerous upward spiral of
                        strategic missile deployments, and would help pave the way for reduction of
                        strategic arms.</p>
                    <p>5. It should be possible for our two countries alone to agree on steps to
                        curtail the strategic arms race.</p>
                    <pb n="702" xml:id="pg_702" facs="0738"/>
                    <p>6. The problem we are facing is urgent. As each month goes by, armaments
                        increase and grow more complex on both sides. An agreement should be easier
                        to negotiate today before further deployments take place than it will in the
                        future, and it could result in important saving of resources.</p>
                    <p>7. We recognize that achieving strategic arms limitations which meet our
                        separately perceived requirements of national security is a complex task,
                        given the nature of contemporary strategic offensive and defensive missile
                        systems and the many factors affecting and determining military
                        capabilities. Our two nations have different levels and kinds of strategic
                        weapons systems and we may not necessarily share identical evaluations
                        regarding the utility and roles of these systems. Moreover, we recognize
                        that in reaching an agreement some adjustments from currently deployed
                        strategic forces may be necessary. However, we believe that equitable and
                        mutually beneficial strategic arms limitations can be attained.</p>
                    <p>8. We believe that the US and the Soviet Union have the following strategic
                        arms limitation objectives in common:</p>
                    <p>—To achieve and maintain a stable US-Soviet strategic deterrent relationship
                        by agreed limitations on the deployment of offensive and defensive strategic
                        missiles.</p>
                    <p>—To enhance the credibility and effectiveness of our efforts to prevent the
                        destabilizing actions of other nations by demonstrating US and Soviet
                        willingness to limit their strategic missile forces.</p>
                    <p>—To provide assurance to each of us that our security will be maintained, or
                        enhanced, while at the same time avoiding the tensions, uncertainties, and
                        costs of an unrestrained continuation of the strategic arms race.</p>
                    <p>—To improve US-Soviet understanding by establishing a continuing process of
                        meaningful discussion of issues arising from our strategic relationship.</p>
                    <p>9. With all of the above considerations in mind, the United States proposes
                        an agreement comprising the following basic elements. The U.S. Delegation
                        will be prepared to discuss these elements in greater detail at an
                        appropriate time after hearing the views of the Soviet Government.</p>
                    <p>10. The United States suggests cessation of the initiation of construction of
                        additional strategic offensive land-based ballistic missile launchers. This
                        weapon category should include launchers for offensive ballistic missiles of
                        intermediate and medium range (i.e., missiles with ranges greater than 1,000
                        km), as well as for longer-range intercontinental missiles. There should
                        also be a prohibition on the further construction and deployment of
                        strategic offensive missile-launching <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0739"/>submarines, and on installing on surface ships facilities
                        for firing offensive ballistic missiles. The difficulties in verifying
                        limitations on specific numbers of deployed mobile land-based strategic
                        offensive missiles and launchers are such that the United States proposes
                        that there be a complete ban on mobile, land-based strategic offensive
                        missile systems.</p>
                    <p>11. The situation with respect to strategic defensive anti-ballistic missile
                        systems is more complex. It would seem that the most feasible limitation on
                        strategic anti-missile defensive systems would be a set and equivalent
                        number of fixed anti-ballistic missile launchers and associated missiles
                        which each side could deploy. The U.S. also proposes that the deployment of
                        mobile <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> launchers and associated missiles
                        be totally prohibited.</p>
                    <p>12. There must, of course, be adequate verification of any agreement. In
                        previous discussions leading up to these talks, we have indicated that the
                        United States is prepared to rely to the maximum possible extent on
                        verification by national means available to the two governments in order to
                        verify an agreement limiting the deployment of strategic offensive and
                        strategic defensive weapons systems, and we indicated that major steps in
                        limiting the deployment of strategic missile systems should be possible on
                        that basis.</p>
                    <p>13. An agreement of the scope just outlined may, however, involve certain
                        aspects which will be difficult to verify with full confidence through
                        national means alone. To meet these potential problems the United States
                        believes that consideration should be given to supplementing national means
                        of verification by some mutually arrived at arrangements for reassurance.
                        Such agreed procedures would increase the confidence of each government in
                        the other's compliance with the agreement and could permit a more
                        comprehensive agreement. Therefore, we should explore at an early stage of
                        our discussions what supplementary means of reassurance could be agreed.</p>
                    <p>14. It would appear that arrangements involving agreed procedures for
                        selective direct observation on U.S. and Soviet territory are the best way
                        of providing this reassurance; there may be other means of contributing to
                        reassurance. The essential point is that each state needs to be able to
                        satisfy itself that the other state is living up to the agreement.</p>
                    <p>15. The United States Government believes these talks can lead to an
                        agreement beneficial to both sides. By our agreement, we could demonstrate
                        to the world at large that our two nations, each endowed with great military
                        power, can act to limit that power. The U.S. Delegation would welcome
                        hearing your comments on the U.S. proposal and any other views the Soviet
                        Delegation is prepared to advance. We hope the Soviet Delegation will agree
                        that the position we have outlined today provides a sound basis for an
                        agreement.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Introduction</p>
                    <p>1. This paper presents guidelines governing the U.S. position during the
                        first phase of U.S.-Soviet talks on strategic missile limitations.</p>
                    <p>2. It is not possible to draw up a detailed scenario covering the talks; much
                        will depend on initial Soviet reaction and how we choose to respond to it.
                        It is also for this reason that, with few exceptions, no attempt has been
                        made to spell out alternate U.S. positions, which will have to be developed
                        later through normal U.S. Government procedures.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Tactics</p>
                    <p>3. This paper deals with the major issues likely to arise in connection with
                        the presentation of our proposal. A certain amount of discussion and
                        clarification of individual features, in isolation from other factors, will
                        be necessary. However, we wish to stress in the discussions that the U.S.
                        proposal should be viewed as a comprehensive entity. We wish to avoid
                        conceding to the Soviets the advantage of concentrating on the inequities of
                        this or that measure. We should point out that, because of the asymmetries
                        in the respective strategic postures of the U.S. and USSR, it would be
                        unrealistic and unnecessary to strive for equality in each category of
                        strategic weapons. Rather we should accept existing asymmetries as a point
                        of departure and strive for an agreement which, in its overall effect, would
                        satisfy the security interests of each side.</p>
                    <p>4. The Delegation should proceed with due caution in presenting the U.S.
                        position. We do not wish to engage in a protracted discussion of
                        generalities, but neither do we wish to show our entire hand without having
                        first obtained at least a general impression of the Soviet approach.</p>
                    <p>5. After settling on formalities, the Delegation should give the “Initial
                        Presentation of U.S. Position” (see separate paper) which contains, in
                        general skeleton form, the outlines of the U.S. proposal.</p>
                    <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0741"/>
                    <p>6. It should be emphasized that, in the ensuing discussion of the U.S.
                        position, the Delegation is not required to present the totality of the
                        position as it is written below for a particular category of weapons in its
                        initial presentation. It may wish to withhold some of the details,
                        particularly on highly technical matters, until later stages in the
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>7. After an exchange of initial views on the proposed force limitations, the
                        Delegation should explore the problem of verification. The U.S. proposal has
                        been drawn up on the assumption that in each instance we could agree to
                        exclusive reliance on national means of verification. We should first,
                        however, make a concerted effort to gain Soviet agreement to additional
                        means of providing reassurance. Specifically, we should propose that both
                        sides agree to arrangements for supplementary procedures involving agreed
                        procedures for selective direct observation on Soviet and U.S. territory for
                        those restrictions which cannot otherwise be verified with high confidence.
                        The Delegation should concentrate its efforts on those items for which
                        supplementary procedures will be demonstrably useful in increasing the
                        confidence that the agreement is being complied with. This concept should be
                        pursued during these portions of the negotiation, but not to the extent of
                        prejudicing the negotiations or precluding, if so instructed, reliance
                        solely on national means of verification. The Delegation should also explore
                        other means of providing reassurance. (Studies are underway to define these
                        items and procedures, and the results will be made available to the
                        Delegation.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Verification Capability</p>
                    <p>8. The judgments of the Intelligence Community on our ability to monitor
                        Soviet compliance with the proposed agreement are contained in <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>-13-68 and various supplementary documents
                        which are available to the Delegation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. and Soviet Forces</p>
                    <p>9. The Delegation has available to it a series of Intelligence Community
                        reports and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> official documents showing
                        the currently existing and possible future Soviet and U.S. strategic
                        systems.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Specific Items in Proposal</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Fixed Land-Based <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> Launchers</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Position</p>
                    <p>1. The proposal would require cessation of the initiation of construction of
                        any additional strategic offensive land-based missile launchers as of
                        September 1, 1968. The Soviet Union would be permitted to complete the
                        launchers which it is constructing as of that date. Beyond that date,
                        however, it would not be allowed to initiate further deployment of fixed
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers. Under no circumstances
                        would either side be permitted to deploy more that 1,200 ICBM launchers.
                        Building of <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0742"/>additional silos,
                        enlarging of existing silos, changing basic external configuration of silos
                        and other launchers, and the relocation of launchers would be prohibited. No
                        additional restrictions would be imposed upon technological improvements of
                        launchers or missiles already deployed, including increasing the hardness of
                        existing silos and deployment of <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>'s, or
                        the retrofitting of existing launchers with new missiles.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Development of U.S. Position</p>
                    <p>2. In presenting this position, the Delegation will probably wish to withhold
                        discussion of the technical details concerning the issue of technological
                        improvements until a general understanding is reached on the basic
                        proposition.</p>
                    <p>3. At some point it should be made clear to the Soviets that the prohibition
                        on additional deployments applies to the deployment of new launchers for
                        partial or multiple orbit strategic missile systems.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Fixed Land-Based IRBM/<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> Launchers</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Position</p>
                    <p>1. Further construction of fixed land-based launchers for IRBM/<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> (ranges greater than 1,000 km.) would be
                        prohibited. The retrofitting of existing IRBM/<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> launchers to accommodate <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        missiles would be prohibited. The installation of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> missiles on IRBM/<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>
                        launchers would be prohibited as would the conversion of IRBM/<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> missiles to <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> missiles. Building of additional silos, enlarging of existing
                        silos, changing basic external configuration of silos and other launchers,
                        further hardening of launchers, and the relocation of launchers would be
                        prohibited. No additional restrictions would be imposed upon technological
                        improvements of launchers or missiles already deployed or the retrofitting
                        of existing launchers with new missiles or intermediate or medium range.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Development of U.S. Position</p>
                    <p>2. As in the case of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers, the
                        Delegation will probably wish to withhold discussion of technological
                        improvements until a general understanding is reached on the basic
                        proposition set forth in the first sentence of the above paragraph.</p>
                    <p>3. The U.S. Delegation may, at its discretion, point out that the Soviet
                        Union at the present time has deployed a large number of this type of
                        missile which presumably are targeted at Western Europe. The United States
                        has no such missiles at its disposal. Thus, the inclusion of this category
                        of missiles in a mutual “freeze” agreement would concede to the Soviet side
                        a certain advantage. This is one of the asymmetries in the Soviet and U.S.
                        strategic forces which an arms limitation agreement must take into account.
                        If we are willing to concede an advantage to the Soviets in this category of
                        weapons, they should be prepared to tolerate a certain advantage to the U.S.
                        in another category.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Mobile Land-Based Strategic Offensive Missile
                        Systems</p>
                    <p>1. The proposal would impose a complete ban on mobile land-based, strategic
                        offensive missile systems (ranges greater than 1,000 km.). Missile systems
                        with such ranges carried by water-borne vehicles on inland waterways would
                        also be prohibited. Any such existing systems would be destroyed.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Development of U.S. Position</p>
                    <p>2. The Delegation should stress that prohibition should be placed on mobile
                        land-based offensive systems, since under conditions of a ban on further
                        deployment of fixed <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers, the
                        arms race could be diverted to the deployment of mobile systems, thus
                        negating the value of the agreement.</p>
                    <p>3. In justifying a total ban, the Delegation should point out that
                        verification by external means of an agreement limiting mobile missile
                        systems to a specific number would be difficult. The possibilities of
                        concealment and redeployment are obvious. However, verification of a total
                        ban would be very much simpler, as the detection of any such system or part
                        thereof clandestinely produced or deployed would be more likely and thus
                        establish a violation.</p>
                    <p>4. The Delegation should point out, at some appropriate stage, that the ban,
                        in addition to prohibiting production and deployment, also would prohibit
                        the testing of missiles in a mobile system configuration. This ban would
                        otherwise not extend to <gloss target="#t_R1">R</gloss>&amp;D.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Mobile Sea-Based Strategic Offensive Missile
                        Systems</p>
                    <p>1. The proposal would ban the construction of additional strategic offensive
                        missile launching submarines or of additional launchers in existing
                        submarines. This prohibition should apply to all submarines with ballistic
                        missile or cruise missile launchers. Such submarines under construction as
                        of September 1, 1968, could be completed, subject to agreement on their
                        number. There would be no limitation on the characteristics of SLBM's or
                        SLCM's, or on retrofitting missile submarines with new or larger missiles of
                        the type with which they are equipped, i.e., ballistic or cruise missiles.
                        The fitting out of surface ships with facilities for firing offensive
                        ballistic missiles would be prohibited.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Development of U.S. Position</p>
                    <p>2. In initially presenting the above position, the Delegation should omit any
                        reference to the completion of the construction of submarine starts
                        underway, and refer simply to a “prohibition on the further construction and
                        deployment of strategic offensive missile-launching submarines,” as stated
                        in the Initial U.S. Presentation. The reason for this caution is the
                        uncertainty concerning the exact number of such submarines the Soviets have
                        under construction; we wish to avoid leaving them <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0744"/>an open field for their making exaggerated
                        claims in this regard which would be difficult to refute with hard evidence.</p>
                    <p>3. The U.S. can accept the completion of the ballistic missile submarines the
                        Soviets have under construction as of September 1, 1968, provided a
                        satisfactory understanding were reached on the exact number. If the Soviets
                        raise the issue of completing submarines under construction, the U.S.
                        Delegation should ask the Soviets to indicate the number of submarines under
                        construction. The Delegation should seek instructions based on the number
                        indicated by the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>4. Even with this understanding, Soviet negotiators would almost certainly
                        object to the U.S. proposal on the grounds that it preserved a distinct
                        advantage for the U.S. and cut short a major Soviet weapons expansion
                        program. Our response should be that certain asymmetries are inevitable in
                        an arms limitation agreement of this sort. Just as we accept the
                        preponderance of Soviet IRBM/<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>
                        launchers, they should accept the imbalance of SLBM forces. We should also
                        point to the substantial Soviet force of submarine-based cruise-type
                        missiles which can be directed at land targets and which have no U.S.
                        equivalent.</p>
                    <p>5. The proposal contemplates an understanding concerning the problem of the
                        growing obsolescence of existing submarines over an extended period of time.
                        The proposed form of such an understanding would be to provide that there
                        would be no initiation of construction for replacement of ballistic or
                        cruise missile submarines within the first five years of the agreement.
                        During that period, the two sides would undertake to reach agreement on
                        rules governing subsequent replacement of submarines. In the absence of a
                        supplementary agreement on such rules, each side may replace submarines
                        after five years from the date of the initiation of the agreement provided
                        that replacement does not increase the total number of submarines or of
                        launchers for submarine-launched ballistic missiles or cruise missiles.</p>
                    <p>6. The Soviets may raise this issue themselves as, over the short run at
                        least, they would benefit more from a replacement program (many of their
                        missile-launching submarines are obsolescent) than would the U.S. The
                        Delegation, therefore, should not initially raise the issue but should await
                        a Soviet initiative. But the Delegation should raise the issue at some point
                        if the Soviets do not.</p>
                    <p>7. In presenting the U.S. proposal, the Delegation should make clear that we
                        consider strategic ballistic and cruise missiles (launched from submarines)
                        of any range as falling within the definition of offensive strategic weapons
                        whose launchers are subject to the limitation. Antisubmarine weapons would
                        not be considered strategic missiles. New ballistic missiles may be
                        retrofitted in ballistic missile submarines and new cruise missiles but not
                        ballistic missiles in cruise missile submarines.</p>
                    <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0745"/>
                    <p>8. While cruise missiles carried on submarines can be defined as having
                        strategic capabilities, those on surface vessels are more difficult to use
                        for strategic purposes. Therefore, no restrictions would be imposed on
                        cruise missiles aboard surface vessels. The proposal would, however,
                        prohibit the installation of facilities for firing offensive ballistic
                        missiles on surface ships.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Position</p>
                    <p>1. The proposal would ban the deployment of more than a set and equivalent
                        number of fixed, land-based anti-ballistic missile launchers and associated
                        anti-ballistic missiles, including reload missiles.</p>
                    <p>A total prohibition on deployment of mobile <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems, both land-based and sea-based, would be imposed. There
                        would be no other constraints on the characteristics of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems deployed.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Development of U.S. Position</p>
                    <p>2. For your information, with regard to the numerical limit on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> launchers, we do not yet have a position.
                        We wish to see if the Soviets accept our proposal in principle, or if they
                        present an alternative proposal. If an understanding is reached on the
                        principle of set and equivalent numbers of anti-ballistic missile launchers
                        and missiles, we would then discuss the precise numerical limit.</p>
                    <p>3. There are two reasons why we believe this to be the most feasible
                        approach. On the one hand, each side has announced plans to deploy, or is
                        deploying <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s. These circumstances, as well
                        as the nuclear forces of third countries, must be taken into account. On the
                        other hand, it must be acknowledged that an unchecked race between our two
                        countries in the deployment of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s would
                        create pressures on both sides to increase their strategic offensive forces,
                        thus making meaningless or impossible any arms limitations in this latter
                        respect.</p>
                    <p>4. The Soviet Union has been widely deploying a strategic air defense system
                        called the SA-5 or Tallinn system. It is generally agreed in the US
                        Intelligence Community that the Tallinn system does not at present have an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability (except possibly for a
                        limited self-defense capability, such as the Nike-Hercules or any other
                        air-defense missile). However, since it is conceivable that it could be
                        augmented and converted to acquire such a capability, a discussion of the
                        capabilities and purposes of this system would be in order. The Delegation
                        should seek to elicit information on the Tallinn system to assure us that it
                        is not and will not be upgraded into an ABM system. Our main aim would be to
                        satisfy ourselves that the Tallinn system is not and will not be upgraded
                        into an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system without our knowledge. If
                        we cannot satisfy ourselves on this matter, then Tallinn systems must be
                        limited and included in the agreed Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> level. As a means of gaining assurance regarding <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0746"/>Tallinn, we should raise the question of
                        radars and attempt to obtain as part of an understanding that replacement of
                        the Tallinn site radars, for example, would be prohibited if Tallinn is to
                        be treated as air defense.</p>
                    <p>5. In discussing the equivalence of the U.S. and Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> limitations, the question of reload would
                        have to be considered. If the Soviets deployed Moscow-type <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> launchers having one reload, they might be
                        limited to a lesser number of launchers than we would deploy. On the other
                        hand, the Soviets could agree to deploy an equal number of non-reloadable
                        launchers.</p>
                    <p>6. Although we consider that radars for <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        systems are a significant item in dealing with the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> question, the present proposal does not provide any such
                        limitation because of concern over possible erroneous categorization of
                        radars. The problems of limitations on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        radars and the relationship of radars to preventing the upgrading of the
                        Tallinn anti-aircraft system to provide it with a significant <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability must be studied further and will
                        have to be among the subjects discussed with the Soviets during the
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. Aircraft and Anti-Aircraft Systems</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The U.S. Position</p>
                    <p>1. The proposal would not include limitations on aircraft or anti-aircraft
                        systems.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Development of U.S. Position</p>
                    <p>2. Both President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> have described the
                        subject of the discussions as concerning both offensive strategic nuclear
                        weapons delivery systems and systems of defense against ballistic missiles.
                        Thus, we cannot exclude a discussion of strategic bombers if the Soviets
                        raise the subject.</p>
                    <p>3. The U.S. Delegation should not refer to bombers unless the Soviets do so.
                        If they raise the issue, the Delegation should say that the U.S. does not
                        believe that bombers should be limited at this time. The Delegation should
                        explain that there is a wide variety of performance characteristics of the
                        aircraft at the disposal of the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and it would be difficult to agree on a definition of
                        “strategic” aircraft. Moreover, the strategic effect of these aircraft
                        depends to a large degree on the missions assigned to them. This is a
                        variable factor, subject to change within a very short period of time, and
                        hence less susceptible to a formal agreement.</p>
                    <p>4. Bombers have not figured importantly in the increase of either side in
                        strategic nuclear delivery capabilities in recent years. In fact, both US
                        and Soviet intercontinental bombers forces have been decreasing in size even
                        without any agreement or limitation on reduction of bombers. Consideration
                        of bomber limitations would also raise the complex issue of air defense.</p>
                    <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0747"/>
                    <p>5. Thus, the US should seek to persuade the Soviets to restrict initial
                        discussion to land and seabased missile and anti-ballistic missile
                        limitations, excluding or if not, possibly deferring, the question of
                        possible aircraft (including air to surface missiles) limitations. If the
                        Soviets present a specific proposal on bomber limitation, the Delegation
                        should say that it will refer the proposal to Washington for consideration.</p>
                    <p>6. Upgrading of Air Defense systems to give them an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability would be prohibited.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VII. Technological Improvements</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The U.S. Position</p>
                    <p>1. There would be no prohibition of technological improvements within the
                        constraints of the agreement.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Development of U.S. Position</p>
                    <p>2. Technological improvements in the characteristics of ballistic missiles
                        and launchers have—and will have—an effect on the strategic balance. These
                        include, for example, the size of warheads or throw weight of launchers, the
                        accuracy of missiles, the number of warheads carried by a missile,
                        penetration aids, and the hardening of missile warheads.</p>
                    <p>3. The Soviets may well raise the question of the announced U.S. <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> programs. They are likely to cite
                        American sources in support of the argument that <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s will give the U.S. an advantage, and that they should be
                        prohibited. The Soviets probably will refer to the commencement of U.S.
                            <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> testing and may demand that the
                        U.S. stop testing immediately. The U.S. should note that this testing was
                        part of a continuing development program which had been planned for a long
                        time and which would continue for several years before the development was
                        complete. Since the Soviets had continued their development and testing of
                        new systems during the year and a half since President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had proposed the talks, we saw no
                        reason why the U.S. should have altered its plans in anticipation of these
                        discussions. Should the Soviets press this issue, the U.S. should respond by
                        inquiring whether the Soviet Union sees a practical way to provide
                        verification for any limitations on <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s
                        and other technological improvements. Any specific Soviet proposal that the
                        U.S. halt <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> testing or deployment must
                        be referred to Washington for consideration.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VIII. Provisions for Revision and Withdrawal</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The U.S. Position</p>
                    <p>1. Either party may propose revision of the agreement if it believes that
                        conditions affecting the agreement have changed. The two parties shall meet
                        from time to time to discuss the operation of the agreement and possible
                        revisions.</p>
                    <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0748"/>
                    <p>2. Nine years after entry into force of this agreement the two parties shall
                        meet for a formal review of the operation of the agreement with a view to
                        assuring that the purposes of the agreement, with any revisions that may
                        have been made during the period, are being realized. In the absence of
                        agreement by the two parties on the continued operation of the agreement
                        with necessary revisions, either party may withdraw by giving six months'
                        notice prior to 10 years from the day of entry into force of the agreement.
                        Otherwise, the agreement shall be automatically renewed for another ten
                        years, at which time this review procedure shall be repeated.</p>
                    <p>3. Either party shall, in exercising its national sovereignty, have the right
                        to withdraw from the agreement at any time if it decides that extraordinary
                        events related to the subject matter of the agreement have jeopardized the
                        supreme interests of its country.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Development of U.S. Position</p>
                    <p>4. The U.S. Delegation should at an early stage in the discussion indicate
                        that the agreement will have to include provision for revision and
                        withdrawal procedures. The presentation of our specific proposal can await
                        progress in determining areas of agreement on limitations.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. Delegation should indicate to the Soviets that either side would
                        have the right to withdraw from the agreement unless adequate revisions can
                        be negotiated, and in the absence of such revisions the United States must
                        be prepared to exercise its right of withdrawal from the agreement. The
                        following are illustrative grounds for revision or withdrawal from the
                        agreement:</p>
                    <p>(1) if the capability of any third country reaches the point where either
                        party to the agreement believes that its security is threatened;</p>
                    <p>(2) if either side believes that extraordinary events have undermined the
                        stability of the agreement;</p>
                    <p>(3) if there is evidence of evasion of the terms of the agreement;</p>
                    <p>(4) if either party takes action which interferes significantly with the
                        other's verification capability or otherwise adversely affects the
                        capability of the other party to verify compliance with the agreement.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">IX. Reductions</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The U.S. Position</p>
                    <p>1. The proposal is not designed to achieve reductions in existing strategic
                        forces.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Development of U.S. Position</p>
                    <p>2. The U.S. Delegation should, in its opening statement, express its
                        conviction that agreement now on measures to curb the strategic arms race
                        not only could lead to substantial savings of national resources to both
                        sides in terms of avoidance of future expenditures but also would help pave
                        the way for substantial reductions of forces in being. The U.S. would be
                        prepared, at an appropriate stage, to discuss such reductions. <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0749"/>But we must acknowledge that an agreement
                        designed to achieve reductions in strategic forces, involving as it would
                        great uncertainties for both sides, would be more difficult to achieve than
                        an agreement on leveling off the strength of these forces, which we now
                        propose. The U.S. is convinced that the necessary first step is an agreement
                        on restricting the present arms race.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">X. Modalities</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The U.S. Position</p>
                    <p>1. Discussion of the form that an agreement might take should be deferred
                        until we have a clearer picture of what such an agreement might cover.
                        Although it is normal practice to embody disarmament agreements in treaty
                        form, other forms of agreement should not be excluded at this time. Should
                        the Soviets raise the subject, the Delegation should seek instructions.</p>
                    <p>2. The Soviets have already agreed to bilateral discussions, and presumably
                        they will stick to this formula. We should oppose any effort they might make
                        to include British or French forces in an agreement, to shift the
                        discussions into the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>, or otherwise to
                        broaden the bilateral discussions and eventual agreement.</p>
                    <p>3. In addition to the provisions for revision and withdrawal discussed in
                        Section VIII above, the Delegation should make clear the right to call for
                        consultations with respect to developments which may raise the question of
                        possible violation by the other party. Some organizational arrangement such
                        as a standing US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> commission would be
                        desirable to provide consultation on a continuous basis.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>I have rather hurriedly examined the position papers and instructions for the
                        strategic missile talks<note n="2" xml:id="d278fn2">See Tab A and Tab B,
                                <ref target="#d277">Document 277</ref>.</note> and submit the
                        following observations.</p>
                    <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0750"/>
                    <p>Although I realize that because of the vital security interest involved,
                        there cannot be much give in our position, the Soviets will recognize that
                        our initial position is loaded in our favor. In general, it will permit us
                        to continue with our own plans while restricting them in carrying out some
                        of their own programs.</p>
                    <p>I am troubled by the position which prohibits hardening of medium range
                        launchers but allows hardening of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s.
                        Not only will this inconsistent position be hard to defend, but it would not
                        seem to be in our interest since the Soviets have a number of soft <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers, whereas we do not. Since at
                        best it would be some time before any agreement could go into effect, it
                        would seem to me far preferable for us to do any additional hardening we
                        wish to do now and work for an agreement which would prevent any hardening
                        of either <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s or <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s.</p>
                    <p>I am particularly troubled by the position on the Tallinn system. It will
                        probably be impossible to get any satisfactory evidence from the Soviets on
                        what this system is. They are already suspicious that our purpose in
                        starting these talks is simply to elicit information.</p>
                    <p>I would anticipate that the Soviets would press hard for the inclusion of
                        bombers on the ground that they constitute a delivery system with a range
                        greater than 1,000 kilometers.</p>
                    <p>The instructions provide no argumentation for handling a Soviet move to
                        include the French and British in any agreement reached. I suggest that we
                        should have a clear position on this matter before the talks begin.</p>

                        concluded its work at a meeting in Rio de Janeiro which ended August
                            30.<note n="2" xml:id="d279fn2">Regarding the formation and early work

                        done by the Ad Hoc Committee has thrown basic issues into sharp relief and
                        has educated Committee members on the hard conflicts of interest which must
                        be resolved before comprehensive international cooperation on the seabed can
                        become a reality.</p>
                    <p>The major accomplishments of the Rio Session were as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. Utilizing the formula you worked out with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d279fn3">See
                                <ref target="#d270">Document 270</ref>.</note> we were able to join
                        all other members in affirming the principle that the deep seabed should be
                        reserved exclusively for peaceful purposes. We made it clear that it was for
                        the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> to take up specific deep seabed
                        arms control measures such as our denuclearization proposal.</p>
                    <p>2. Through intensive effort we did much to overcome underdeveloped country
                        suspicion of our motives in proposing an International Decade of Ocean
                        Exploration. The Committee welcomed and generally supported the Decade, as
                        an element in long-term <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> programs.</p>
                    <p>3. With unusually solid cooperation from a Western Group, including Japan and
                        Australia, we succeeded in obtaining the support of a number of Asians and
                        Africans for a statement of bedrock legal principles which might govern the
                        exploration and use of the deep seabed. Nevertheless the Latin Americans
                        remained immovable in the light of their fears that their 200-mile claims
                        would be adversely affected, and the Soviet Bloc was unexpectedly rigid in
                        refusing to endorse any principles. The Western formulation will be a
                        starting point for future <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> work in this
                        area.</p>
                    <p>4. There was virtually complete consensus for a Standing Committee to work
                        toward internationally agreed arrangements which will permit the orderly
                        development of the seabed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction in the
                        interest of the international community.</p>
                    <p>We are now preparing for General Assembly discussion of the Seabed Committee
                        report. We will attempt to persuade Assembly members that real progress can
                        only be made in this matter by proceeding through consensus rather than
                        numerical majorities. We will stress that this is the only alternative to an
                        open split between underdeveloped and advanced countries, which would
                        frustrate the whole exercise.</p>

                    <p>Although the Soviet Union's military incursion into Czechoslovakia in late
                        August 1968 abruptly undermined the prospect for an early summit meeting and

                        conditions and proposals for a summit. At his meeting with Rostow, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> took down these points and
                        repeated them several times to make sure he understood them. The first of
                        these points was, “The President does not wish to launch the missile talks
                        at a meeting lower than the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>-Johnson level.” Concerning the missile talks, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said early in their conversation:</p>
                    <p>“He said, as he had said several times to <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>, that he had seen the position papers of the Soviet
                        Union. They were detailed and highly technical. Moreover, he said that as a
                        diplomat he must report to me in candor that they represented not a final
                        position but a bargaining position. He assumed that our papers would be
                        similar in character. To complete the negotiation on the missile question
                        would, in his judgment, take considerable time. Therefore, if concrete
                        results were to emerge from a first meeting between <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and the President, he thought we
                        should consider two possible steps: </p>
                    <p>“—an early exchange of papers at the Ambassadorial level: via <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> in Moscow and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> in Washington. This could be done
                        quietly and would give each side a chance to see what elements in them could
                        be the subject for an interim agreement in principle at the Summit meeting; </p>
                    <p>“—an effort be made, before a Summit meeting, to agree on these matters of
                        broad principle which would guide the negotiations in the wake of a Summit
                        meeting.” (Memorandum from Rostow to the President, September 10; ibid.) </p>
                    <p>The remainder of their long conversation covered the problems in the Middle
                        East, Vietnam, and Czechoslovakia and their relationship to <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717" facs="0753"/>the proposed summit. The six points are
                        contained in an unsigned paper, September 7; ibid. </p>
                    <p>Discussions on a proposed summit and preparations for the opening of the
                        missile talks continued to the end of 1968. <ref target="#d281">See

                            delivered the contents of the note to Rostow just before 1 p.m. on
                            September 13, and also left with him <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s “handwritten translation from which we typed
                            up his communication, literally.” The handwritten text is ibid. Rostow
                            also summarized the points he raised with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> following the latter's presentation, as they
                            might pertain to a prospective summit meeting. None of Rostow's points
                            involved the strategic missile talks or arms control. <p> Rostow offered
                                his “very tentative first thoughts” on the Soviet message in a
                                memorandum to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, September 13, 3 p.m. Concerning strategic
                                missiles, Rostow wrote: “The formula on missile talks is probably as
                                far as one could go unless one were immediately to exchange position
                                papers and try to get a bit more substance into the communique.”
                                Later in the same memorandum, he called this formula “promising.”

                                Rostow related his just completed conversation with Secretary

                    <p>1. As before the attitude in Moscow is positive to the idea of meeting with
                        the President of the United States for an exchange of opinions on questions
                        of mutual interest. The wish of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> to have some degree of certitude in the positive
                        outcome of his possible visit to the Soviet Union is understandable to us.
                        It is also far from being indifferent to us what will be the result of such
                        an exchange of opinions, though it is obvious that efforts from both sides
                        will be needed to gain a success. </p>
                    <p>There is no objection in Moscow as to a discussion during such a meeting of
                        questions named by the American side: curbing of strategic armaments race,
                        question of Viet-Nam and the situation in the Middle <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0754"/>East; this, of course, does not exclude the
                        possibility of an exchange of opinion on other questions too. </p>
                    <p>2. So far as the question of strategic armaments is concerned, our point of
                        view is that an exchange of opinions on this question during the meeting
                        could result in an agreement that fulfilment of certain restraining measures
                        in this field would answer to the interests of both our countries as well as
                        to the task of strengthening international security. It would be possible to
                        agree further on certain basic principles of limitation and then reduction
                        in complex of both the offensive strategic nuclear weapons delivery systems
                        and the systems of defense against ballistic missiles, having in mind that
                        this would constitute a directive of the two Governments to their
                        delegations to engage then in working out of an agreement on the concrete
                        aspects of this problem. </p>

                            the understanding that Rostow would hand the text of the message to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, and revised
                            by Rostow (memorandum from Rostow to <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, September 15; ibid.). Rostow forwarded the revised

                            under cover of a memorandum, September 16. Also attached were “rough

                            President's attitude as I've perceived it, with no trace of ultimatum,”
                            and a “paper of issues and actions that lie down the line if you decide
                            to proceed.” (Ibid.) The message forwarded to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> is identical to the text
                            printed here. <p>In a September 16 memorandum for President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, Rostow reported that he
                                handed this memorandum to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, with whom he met from 6-7:30 p.m. that
                                evening, noting that it had the same status as <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s September 13 “oral
                                communication.” After reading the memorandum carefully, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> “said in general that the
                                communication was 'positive and clear.'” Concerning the missile
                                talks, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> made the
                                following observations: “He understood our objective in proposing an
                                amplification of the principles. He wanted to know, simply, whether
                                the response of the Soviet government should come back through his
                                channel to me or through normal diplomatic exchanges. I said that
                                until we were clearer as to whether the conditions for a Summit were
                                mutually understood and agreed, he might let their response come
                                back to me. I then went through the points that it was agreed that I
                                should make on a 'personal basis' as reflecting the attitude of the
                                President, as he had indicated it to Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and myself.” (Ibid.) </p>

                    <p>The President has considered very carefully the observations made by
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on September
                            13.<note n="2" xml:id="d282fn2">

                        importance <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0755"/>to the understanding of
                        Soviet leaders that a positive outcome of a highest level meeting between
                        the two sides is essential to a success; and he agrees that this requires
                        efforts from both sides. </p>
                    <p>The President wishes the Soviet leadership to have his further reflections
                        about how such a success could be achieved. </p>
                    <p>With respect to offensive and defensive missiles, the President agrees that
                        it ought to be possible to establish certain common basic principles
                        affecting the limitation and subsequent reduction in such nuclear weapons
                        systems. He further agrees that, following an accord on general principles
                        at the highest level, representatives of the two sides would have to address
                        themselves to the translation of general principles into the more concrete
                        aspects of the problem. </p>
                    <p>It would, however, be desirable to go beyond a general statement that
                        “restraining measures in this field would answer to the interests of both
                        our countries as well as to the task of strengthening international
                        security.” With this in mind, the President would be glad to know whether
                        the Soviet leaders could accept the following general objectives as guidance
                        for our respective delegations or would wish to suggest any amendments for
                        his consideration: </p>
                    <p>—To achieve and maintain a stable U.S.-Soviet strategic deterrence by agreed
                        limitations on the deployment of offensive and defensive strategic missiles. </p>
                    <p>—To enhance the credibility of our efforts to prevent the destabilizing

                            Relations Committee recommended, by a vote of 13-3-3, that the Senate
                            give its advice and consent to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. For text of
                            the Committee's report, September 26, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on
                                Disarmament, 1968</hi>, pp. 642-667. </note> I gave him the details
                        of the vote as we knew it, in which he was interested. I said this was
                        favorable, and had been done in spite of the action of the Soviet Union in
                        connection with Czechoslovakia. However, it had been very difficult to
                        achieve because of the question of their intentions. I said that if there
                        were further similar events in Romania and Yugoslavia, the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and other arrangements between us might
                        just as well be forgotten. He asked why I felt there would be such other
                        events, and I said certainly that there were rumors on a broad enough scale
                        to raise question. He said that he had officially informed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> there would be no further action and he
                        reiterated that assurance to me. It was impossible, he said, to conceive of
                        additional action in connection with Romania and Yugoslavia where conditions
                        were completely different. He was interested as to further appraisal of
                        chances for floor passage of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, which
                        I said were good in my opinion, although the brief period for the remaining
                        weeks of the session made it difficult to be sure as to the passage of any
                        floor bills. I said we continued, however, to be hopeful now that a major
                        hurdle had been overcome in the committee. </p>
                    <p>We then talked about other disarmament items including a possible expansion
                        of the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>, which he felt was dangerous
                        since opening the doors to include the Japanese, who were likely candidates,
                        would mean pressure from other nations. We discussed the <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss>,<note n="3" xml:id="d283fn3">Regarding this

                        we did, particularly as to the request for greater assurances, free gifts of
                        nuclear equipment, fuels and <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0757"/>know-how, and the possibility of regular continuing sessions of a
                        fundamentally irresponsible body. </p>
                    <p>He asked as to our plans for the General Assembly on disarmament. I responded
                        that we would, of course, be prepared to talk on the Report of the ENDC
                        including further discussions on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>,
                        the seabed, and <gloss target="#t_CBW1">CBW</gloss>, with particular
                        reference on this latter to a Secretary General's study of effects. He
                        informed me that the Soviet delegation to the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> would not arrive until September 30 and he was already
                        attempting to make arrangements for the arrival of the special plane for
                        their delegation. He didn't know whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would be coming or perhaps Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName>, in view of his intimate
                        knowledge of the situation in Prague. </p>
                    <p>He told me of the Soviet inscription in the General Assembly of an item of
                        urgency to stop the arms race and achieve disarmament. </p>
                    <p>I emphasized throughout the responsibility which his government had if
                        further advances in arms control were to take place since events such as
                        Czechoslovakia would prevent any progress whatsoever. He again attempted to
                        reassure me that things would be much better rather than worse. </p>
                    <p>It was clear from his conversation that he had had no advance notice of the
                        intrusion into Czechoslovakia. </p>

                            <ref target="#d263fn3">See footnote 3, Document 263</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. A primary concern at <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> is likelihood
                        that resolution will be passed either calling for permanent machinery to
                        carry on tasks of <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> or calling for
                        periodic meetings—or both. In view of possible disruptive <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0758"/>effects of continuing activity of the sort
                        transpiring at <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss>, we believe we should
                        make every reasonable effort to forestall or water down proposals for <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> perpetuation.</p>
                    <p>2. Unless you see overriding objection, action addressees should approach
                        FonOffs <gloss target="#t_ASAP1">ASAP</gloss> at most effective level to
                        explain US position as follows. Subjects being discussed at <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> are matters which in one form or another
                        already are being considered constructively in other bodies—security issues
                        in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>; disarmament in <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>, as well as in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>; peaceful uses in <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>, General
                        Conference and Atoms for Peace Conference. These bodies will continue to
                        consider and have responsibility for these questions regardless of what the
                            <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> may accomplish. In some cases, such
                        as in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, such consideration will begin
                        promptly after <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> concludes. It would be
                        relatively meaningless for <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> to carry over
                        what some may consider unfinished business to a later session, since in the
                        meantime these subjects will be actively dealt with elsewhere. Moreover,
                        fact that nuclear powers are not voting participants in <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> is in itself argument for conducting
                        further discussions in existing forums where virtually all interested
                        parties are represented, on equal basis. </p>
                    <p>3. In view above, you should state that USG does not plan participate in
                        further meetings of bodies organized along lines <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> and cannot support fixing any date for future conferences of
                        this sort. We would not be able to support establishment of any permanent
                        machinery to carry on tasks of <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> because
                        of existence of various organs and agencies charged with responsibility for
                        matters under discussion of <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss>. You should
                        accordingly strongly urge that host Govt not support <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> perpetuation. </p>
                    <p>4. You may also say that one acceptable alternative to <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> perpetuation would be for <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> to recommend putting item on agenda of
                        early GA session (e.g., 24th) which would provide opportunity to re-examine
                        conclusions of <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> in light of progress made
                        in interim by the responsible organs and agencies. You should emphasize we
                        will continue our intensive efforts in these existing agencies and bodies
                        for promotion peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to work towards
                        disarmament objectives. We are convinced that existing organs and agencies
                        provide most practical and realistic vehicle for concrete progress in these
                        fields. </p>
                    <p>5. Addresses, in case of governments not attending <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss>, may at their discretion make above demarche if it would
                        favorably influence position host Govt at <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>.</p>

                        He said that the idea of the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> meeting on this subject had been at the US initiative, that
                        the US thought it would be useful with the non-nuclear conference in Geneva
                        and that the Soviets were now prepared to go ahead with the talks on October
                        7, as suggested by the US. The Secretary asked whether this subject had been

                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that they had just

                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> did not wish to discuss
                        the PNEDS talks.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he would have to discuss this question with the
                        President and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, and
                        that he would let <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> know
                        later. He observed that there were complications. </p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the Executive Branch, as the Ambassador knew, was
                        attempting to move the non-proliferation treaty through the Senate. In
                        response to the Ambassador's question, he said he thought the matter would

                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> (Karl Lahusen, third-ranking member
                        of the German Embassy here, spoke to me approvingly about this action); </p>
                    <p>3. Supported also by such other US Allies as the entire Latin American bloc,
                        Korea, Vietnam, and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>; and</p>
                    <p>4. Supported by Yugoslavia and Romania. </p>
                    <p>With the exception of Thailand, none of the five abstaining countries
                        (Thailand, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia) plays a significant role in
                        international affairs. The abstentions of Tanzania and Zambia presumably
                        reflect Chinese influence. </p>
                    <p>In sum, there would appear to be overwhelming international support for an
                        early beginning of these talks. None of our Allies which are most concerned
                        about the consequences of Czechoslovakia or are generally leery about signs
                        of US-Soviet collaboration either opposed or abstained on the resolution. </p>
                    <p>You may wish to bring this development to the attention of the Secretary, if
                        that has not already been done.<note n="3" xml:id="d286fn3">In a September

                        considered in Moscow. In this connection we, for our part, should also like
                        to express some ideas. </p>
                    <p>I. It has been noted in Moscow that the President has reacted favorably to
                        our suggestion that in the course of the meeting there should be established
                        basic principles affecting the limitation and subsequent reduction in
                        strategic armaments. We, for our part, agree that simultaneously the general
                        objectives of our two countries in this field should be formulated in a more
                        detailed form.</p>
                    <p>On the whole as a result of the exchange of views on the question of
                        restraining the strategic arms race it could, in our opinion, be stated that
                        the two sides had arrived at a conclusion on the expediency and feasibility
                        of achieving a mutually acceptable understanding on this question, and that
                        the implementation of measures to restrain the strategic arms race would
                        answer to the interests of both our countries as well as to the interests of
                        strengthening international security, and that this would also generate more
                        favorable conditions for solving other major issues in the field of
                        disarmament.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, it could be agreed that the two sides would be guided by the
                        following general objectives: </p>
                    <p>—To achieve and maintain a stable U.S.-Soviet strategic deterrence by agreed
                        limitations on the deployment of offensive and defensive strategic
                        armaments. </p>
                    <p>—To enhance the credibility of our efforts to prevent the destabilizing
                        actions of other nations by demonstrating Soviet and U.S. willingness to
                        limit their strategic armaments. </p>
                    <p>—To provide mutual assurance to each of us that our security will be
                        maintained, while at the same time avoiding the tensions, uncertainties, and
                        costs of an unrestrained continuation of the strategic arms race. </p>
                    <p>—To improve U.S.-Soviet understanding by establishing a continuing process of
                        discussion of issues arising from the strategic situation. </p>
                    <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0762"/>
                    <p>At the same time it could be agreed that the task of limiting and
                        subsequently reducing strategic armaments should be resolved in compliance
                        with the following basic principles: </p>
                    <p>(1) The limitation and reduction in strategic armaments should be carried out
                        with due regard for the integral interconnection of the two principal
                        components of such armaments, i.e. offensive and defensive weapons systems. </p>
                    <p>(2) The limitation and reduction in strategic armaments should be carried out
                        as a complex including both offensive strategic nuclear weapons delivery
                        systems and anti-ballistic missile systems. </p>
                    <p>(3) The limitation and reduction in strategic armaments should be so balanced
                        that neither side could obtain any military advantages and that equal
                        security should be assured for both sides. </p>
                    <p>There could also be registered an agreement of the two sides, along with
                        implementation of measures to limit and reduce strategic armaments, to study
                        the question of taking steps to rule out the accidental appearance of
                        conflict-fraught situations involving the use of strategic armaments. </p>
                    <p>In conclusion it could be agreed that special delegations of the two
                        governments, guided by the above-mentioned objectives and principles, would
                        promptly address themselves to devising an agreement on the concrete aspects
                        of the problem of limiting and reducing strategic armaments. </p>
                    <p>Agreement, reached during the meeting, on the above-listed aspects of the
                        problem of limiting and reducing strategic armaments could, in our view,
                        then be set forth either in the final communique of the meeting or in the
                        form of a joint statement of our two governments. </p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The Soviet memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d288fn2">
                            <ref target="#d287">Document 287</ref>.</note> is, in general substance,
                        consistent with the US proposal which has been developed for presentation to
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The memorandum sets forth certain
                        “general objectives” and also the “basic principles” which would be utilized
                        in seeking to reach these objectives. It is contemplated that these
                        objectives and principles would be set forth in a communique or joint
                        statement following an initial meeting. In our view, any such agreed
                        statement should embody the following changes: </p>
                    <p>(1) The first proposed general objective, at the top of page 2, is “to
                        achieve and maintain a stable US-Soviet strategic deterrence.” The word
                        “achieve” may be intended to suggest that some adjustment of the present
                        nuclear balance is required to bring about numerical equality in some
                        respects. We should take the position that effective deterrence now exists
                        and that the proper objective is to “maintain a stable US-Soviet strategic
                        deterrence.” </p>
                    <p>(2) The first two “basic principles,” at the bottom of page 2 and the top of
                        page 3, phrase differently the subject matter of the proposed arms
                        limitation agreement. The first of these refers to “offensive and defensive
                        weapons systems” and thus would include manned bombers and missile systems
                        designed to defend against manned bombers. The subsequent paragraph refers
                        to the limitation and reduction of “offensive strategic nuclear weapons
                        delivery systems and anti-ballistic missile systems.” This would appear to
                        cover manned bombers, but not bomber defenses. Our proposal does not include
                        limitations either on aircraft or on anti-aircraft systems. In view of the
                        fact that the two paragraphs cover essentially the same subject matter, we
                        should propose dropping the second and leaving the first with its general
                        language about “offensive and defensive weapons systems.” This would leave
                        us free in the course of negotiations to determine the advisability of
                        including or excluding bombers and bomber defenses. </p>
                    <p>(3) The third basic principle, contained in the second paragraph on page 3,
                        talks of assuring “equal security” for both sides. Here again, the <pb n="728" xml:id="pg_728" facs="0764"/>intent may be to provide for an
                        adjustment in the existing nuclear balance to achieve numerical equality in
                        one or more areas. US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> forces are
                        not symmetrical at the present time and our security needs differ in some
                        respects. We should point out that the word “equal” is tautological as a
                        qualifier of “security” and should be deleted. </p>
                    <p>(4) The third paragraph on page 3 does not clearly convey the thought that
                        the two sides should study means for preventing the development of
                        situations which pose the risk of escalation to nuclear war. The word
                        “minimize” might be substituted for the words “rule out” in line 3 of
                        paragraph 3. The word “possible” might be added at the beginning of line 5
                        of paragraph 3. </p>
                    <p>(5) It is our understanding that the last two paragraphs of the memorandum
                        contemplate that there will be an initial high-level meeting at which
                        agreement will be reached on the “general objectives” and “basic principles”
                        which will then be recorded in a communique or joint statement. Thereafter,
                        special delegations will meet to develop a final agreement, guided by these
                        objectives and principles. The memorandum thus apparently does not foreclose
                        the possibility of a formal treaty although it does not specify the form
                        that a final agreement is to take. </p>

                    <p>Ambassador Malik inquired as to the prospects of Japan, Brazil and Argentina
                        signing the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> replied that it was his opinion that Japan would sign
                        the Treaty; it would take some time, but he thought Japan would sign before
                        the end of the current year. As for Brazil, he wanted to say in strictest
                        confidence that it was really a matter of their Foreign Minister having some
                        strange ideas to the effect that Brazil needed to retain the right of
                        developing its own nuclear capability for the purpose of carrying out
                        peaceful nuclear explosions. But, in the end, he was confident that the
                        Foreign Minister would not present any obstacles to Brazil's signing the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. The main problem, though, was that
                        Brazil's delay created problems for its neighbor, Argentina, and Argentina's
                        delay, in turn, created problems for Chile; it was in the nature of a chain
                        reaction. Ambassador Malik said the situation resembled that of India and
                        Pakistan. The Secretary agreed and said the Foreign Minister of Pakistan had
                        told him he could not sign unless India signed as well. He hoped that the
                        Soviet Union would influence India in the direction of signing the Treaty.
                        To Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s question as to when
                        the US Senate could be expected to take up the ratification of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, the Secretary replied that he hoped it
                        would be this week. We had a count on the Democratic Senators in this
                        respect and had no problem here. Tomorrow morning he was going to see Mr.
                        Nixon and hoped that he could persuade him privately to press Republican
                        Senators for ratification now. In reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s question the Secretary said that he hoped Mr.
                        Nixon would approach the problem with proper understanding. </p>

                    <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName>:</p>
                    <p>Events in Czechoslovakia seemed to have overtaken any urgency for the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> speech proposed in your memorandum of
                        August 16, 1968<note n="2" xml:id="d290fn2">
                            <ref target="#d276fn3">See footnote 3, Document 276</ref>.</note> and
                        thus, the need for my immediate reply. I believe, however, that you would be
                        interested in our general views on the subject of an agreement for a cutoff
                        of production of fissionable material for use in weapons. </p>
                    <p>From the standpoint of <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>'s
                        responsibilities, we are principally concerned with the effect that a cutoff
                        would have on the ability of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> to meet
                        possible weapon production requirements. To that end, we plan to make a
                        study of our ability to meet foreseeable requirements for fissionable
                        material and tritium under conditions of a cutoff, and will be happy to make
                        the results of that study available to the agencies represented on the
                        Committee of Principals. </p>
                    <p>Changes in US requirements for fissionable material and tritium for weapons,
                        in projected demands for fissionable material for non-weapons use, and in
                            <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>'s production operations have
                        occurred since the Committee of Principals last reviewed the US position on
                        a cutoff, several years ago. We believe that another review by the Committee
                        of Principals would be very useful in terms of over-all perspective
                        concerning the desirability of a cutoff. </p>
                    <p>We are also concerned about the present adequacy of the inspection procedures
                        which were outlined in 1964 (<gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>/134)<note n="3" xml:id="d290fn3">
                            <ref target="#d251fn2">See footnote 2, Document 251</ref>.</note> to
                        apply to nuclear-weapon states under a cutoff agreement. In particular,
                        demands for uranium enriching services to provide fuel for nuclear power
                        reactors have expanded at a much greater rate than foreseen in 1964, and
                        this raises a question as to the suitability of the monitoring procedures
                        provided for in <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>/134. Progress in the
                        development of the technology of uranium enrichment by gas centrifuge has
                        also been substantial. The procedures for monitoring operating uranium
                        enrichment plants were based on the premise that such plants would continue
                        operation at low production rates to meet demands for enriched uranium for
                        non-weapons <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0767"/>use, and that those
                        demands would be small relative to existing stocks of fissionable material.
                            <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>/134 recognized that the monitoring
                        procedures will have to be reviewed “as peaceful uses grow and involve
                        substantially larger quantities of fissionable material.” We believe that it
                        would be desirable to consider whether the monitoring procedures outlined in
                            <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>/134 are still appropriate in the
                        changed circumstances. Accordingly, we intend to study this question and
                        will make the results of our study available to the agencies represented on
                        the Committee of Principals. </p>
                    <p>In order that our studies may be most useful, we would appreciate your
                        providing us with the specific language of the cutoff proposal you would
                        like to have considered for possible use at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the existing alternate proposal of plant-by-plant shutdowns,
                        we believe that US actions since 1964 require that such a proposal be
                        reformulated. We now have completely shut down two production reactors and
                        have placed five others in standby. The reactors in standby are available
                        for our use, given adequate lead time, for the production of plutonium or
                        tritium for use in weapons or, alternatively, for production of materials
                        for non-weapons use. Furthermore, some of the reactors still in operation
                        are being used entirely for the production of materials for uses other than
                        weapons. Accordingly, we believe that if and when any plant-by-plant offer
                        is restated, consideration should be given to phrasing it in such a manner
                        that it comprehends the following alternative actions: (1) shutting down
                        permanently, under verification, of an operating reactor; (2) placing in
                        standby under verification (for possible subsequent verified operation for
                        permitted uses) of a currently operating reactor; (3) placing under
                        verification a reactor already shut down or in standby, which had previously
                        been a source of fissionable material for use in weapons; or (4) placing a
                        currently operating reactor under verification to assure that the material
                        being produced is only for permitted uses. </p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Background </p>
                    <p>1. Traditionally, the Soviets have appeared to view arms control and
                        disarmament primarily as a field of political warfare. While such
                        considerations have continued to color much of the Soviet attitude during
                        the past few years, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> did enter into
                        agreements on nuclear testing in 1963, on weapons in outer space in 1967,
                        and this year on nuclear nonproliferation. There were advantages to Soviet
                        foreign policy in doing so, and in addition, the progress which was being
                        made in their strategic programs gave the Soviet leaders confidence that
                        their relative position would not be disadvantaged by these limited
                        agreements. The willingness of the Soviets to entertain more far-reaching
                        agreements with the West will obviously depend on a very complex interplay
                        of military, political, and economic considerations. </p>
                    <p>2. The Soviet nine-point disarmament memorandum publicly issued on 1 July
                        1968 was primarily a propaganda document. With various points addressed to
                        different potential forums, the memorandum was evidently not intended as a
                        package proposal. Probably it was aimed mainly at claiming the initiative
                        for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and obscuring the <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733" facs="0769"/>fact that it was the US which, for more
                        than 18 months, had pressed for a new effort to negotiate limitations on
                        strategic weapons. Most of the proposals contained in the memorandum are old
                        standbys which have been used in a propaganda context for many years (e.g.,
                        calls for banning the use of nuclear, chemical, and bacteriological weapons,
                        for abolishing foreign military bases, and for prohibiting nuclear armed
                        bomber flights outside national frontiers). But a few of them concern
                        matters on which Moscow has expressed interest in other ways, and on which
                        it may see advantage in serious negotiation. Such proposals concern
                        limitation of strategic weapons systems, peaceful uses of the seabed,
                        banning underground nuclear testing, and some measures for regional arms
                        control. None of these is fundamentally new either; all are items that have
                        been periodically promoted by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> at
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and elsewhere. Clearly, the first of
                        these is the most basic in its implications for the relationship between the
                        two powers and the only one now contemplated for bilateral negotiations. </p>
                    <p>3. The Soviets had, of course, agreed to have talks with the US on strategic
                        arms limitations several days prior to the issuance of the nine-point
                        memorandum, which was released in connection with a Kosygin speech made at
                        the Moscow signing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The moment
                        chosen for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s belated acceptance of
                        the US proposal suggests that the motives which underlay the decision must
                        have been complex. The response came during a period when there seemed to be
                        no noticeable relaxation in Soviet propaganda attacks against the West; it
                        coincided with the buildup of heavy military and political pressures against
                        Czechoslovakia; and it was announced only months before a change of
                        administrations in Washington. Moreover, the Soviets had long maintained
                        that major steps toward improving relations with the US were impossible
                        during the Vietnam War. While on the face of things the moment chosen may
                        seem improbable, some of these circumstances may actually have given the
                        Soviets incentives to move when they did. </p>
                    <p>4. Both political and military factors probably figured in the long delay of
                        the Soviet response. For one thing, the Soviets have customarily responded
                        to US arms control initiatives with a great measure of caution and
                        suspicion. On so complex and sensitive an issue as strategic arms
                        limitations, the misgivings—probably, in fact, the resistance—of certain
                        elements both within and outside the Soviet political leadership must have
                        been considerable. The period of delay permitted a further narrowing of the
                        gap between Soviet and American strategic forces; the Soviets are now
                        approaching the US in numbers of operational inter-continental ballistic
                        missile (<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>) launchers and are also
                        building a submarine force similar to the Polaris. They must now have
                        strengthened confidence in their possession of an assured destruction
                        capability, and considering <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734" facs="0770"/>qualitative differences in weapon systems such as warhead yield, the
                        target system to be attacked, and damage-limiting capabilities, they may
                        actually consider that they have now achieved rough strategic parity with
                        the U.S. Thus, they must believe that their bargaining position in
                        negotiations has become stronger. </p>
                    <p>5. The Soviet military intervention in Czechoslovakia has complicated the
                        political environment bearing on arms control. It indicated that Moscow's
                        determination to preserve a secure position in Eastern Europe outweighed
                        other considerations, including its interest in early negotiation on
                        strategic arms control. It is still too soon to evaluate the full
                        implications of the Czech crisis for Soviet policy, and specifically for
                        Soviet attitudes toward arms control. The move toward new disarmament
                        negotiations was probably calculated to help offset the opprobrium the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> suffered from the Czech
                        intervention. How Moscow's attitude toward strategic arms talks now develops
                        will also depend on the impact of recent events on attitudes and policies in
                        Washington. The Soviets have maintained that the Czech crisis is no one's
                        business except their own and Eastern Europe's and a matter quite apart from
                        questions of mutual interest to both East and West. It was in this spirit,
                        at least, that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> recently
                        reaffirmed Soviet desires to begin talks with the US.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Considerations Affecting the Soviet Approach to
                        Negotiations The Strategic Relationship </p>
                    <p>6. Having significantly improved their relative position in strategic forces
                        in recent years, the Soviets probably believe that a considerable sustained
                        effort will be necessary to maintain the position they have now achieved;
                        the Soviets must recognize that the competition in this field will not stand
                        still. They probably fear that projected US programs will once again
                        increase the US relative advantage considerably, unless the Soviets
                        themselves undertake strenuous new efforts. The choices posed for the Soviet
                        leaders at present are: (a) to attempt to keep pace by making the indicated
                        effort; (b) to permit the US to move out far ahead once more; or (c) to
                        attempt by agreement to stabilize the strategic relationship at a point less
                        unfavorable to the USSR than it ever has been. </p>
                    <p>7. It seems likely that, after the effort they have made and the resources
                        they have expended, the Soviet leaders would find it intolerable to see
                        their improved position degraded. No doubt there would be some who would
                        argue that the forces the Soviets will have under current programs would
                        give them an assured destruction capability for many years to come,
                        regardless of what the US did. But it is unlikely that the pressures of
                        military leaders and the play of Kremlin politics would permit resigned
                        acceptance of a widening gap. The argument for staying in the race, for
                        political as well as security reasons, would probably prevail in the end. </p>
                    <pb n="735" xml:id="pg_735" facs="0771"/>
                    <p>8. Faced, however, with the oncoming US programs—Poseidon and Minuteman III
                        (with multiple independently-targeted reentry vehicles), and Sentinel—the
                        Soviets must recognize that, if they want to stay in the race, they have
                        their work cut out for them. Not only would there be enormous economic
                        costs, but the Soviets would inevitably have some doubts of their ability to
                        match the US over the whole range of technological development for more
                        advanced systems. Moreover, further large allocations of resources to
                        strategic forces would tighten the squeeze on other military programs. This
                        would be particularly troubling to those military leaders who feel that the
                        general purpose forces are now in pressing need of refurbishing and perhaps
                        enlargement. </p>
                    <p>9. The outlook for the competition between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the field of ballistic missile defense
                        probably offers the Soviets grounds for concern. They have a system of
                        limited effectiveness deployed at Moscow, but they evidently realize that
                        more development work is needed before extensive deployment would be
                            worthwhile.<note n="4" xml:id="d291fn4">For a full discussion of the
                            status and prospects of the Soviet antiballistic missile program, see

                        in this field is still at an early stage and will not affect the balance of
                        strategic power for some years, but they know that development work is going
                        forward in the US and that deployment is planned. While the Soviets, on the
                        basis of the extensive work they have already done, are probably confident
                        that they can sustain the competition in this field, they may also come to
                        believe that the net result would be a vast expenditure of economic
                        resources without any effective return in increased security. </p>
                    <p>10. Thus, there are incentives for the Soviets to consider more seriously now
                        the option of negotiations to limit strategic forces. They could calculate
                        that an agreement to stabilize the strategic relationship, or at least to
                        slow down the competition, if achieved in the next year or two, would be the
                        best means of preserving the improved relative position the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has been acquiring. They might further
                        think that, even if no agreement was finally reached, the process of
                        negotiation itself, because of the expectations it would arouse in the US
                        and elsewhere, would act to slow the pace of the competition for a time. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Factors </p>
                    <p>11. Economic considerations doubtless contributed also to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s decision to discuss strategic arms
                        control. To the extent that the Soviets had been motivated by the desire to
                        limit over-all military costs and free resources for other purposes, they
                        would presumably continue to want to avoid provoking a new surge in arms
                        competition. Soviet <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0772"/>spokesmen have,
                        over the past year, repeatedly pointed to the high level of defense
                        expenditures in the US. Though some of these statements were probably
                        intended as arguments for, or justification of, increases in Soviet defense
                        outlays, others almost certainly reflected the Soviets' concern over similar
                        rising costs in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>12. Over the past several years, the Soviets have been following a policy of
                        expanding strategic programs and increasing investment in the consumer goods
                        and services sectors of the economy while allowing rates of growth of
                        investment in heavy industry to decline. This policy limits the output of
                        producers goods and will ultimately retard the over-all rate of economic
                        growth. Thus, the Soviet leaders probably must divert resources to the
                        producers goods sector of the economy in the near future or risk seriously
                        impairing future capacity for satisfying military as well as civilian
                        objectives. The important question is which claimant is going to yield—the
                        consumer or the military—and when? In the past, the Soviet decision would
                        have been quite predictable: the consumer has traditionally borne the brunt
                        of any resource bind. The Soviet leaders probably recognize that the
                        political cost of this course is greater in their society now than it used
                        to be. Therefore, as certain strategic programs approach planned levels,
                        some Soviet leaders might prefer to avoid heavy new expenditures for
                        follow-on military programs. An arms control agreement could reduce the
                        pressures for such programs. </p>
                    <p>13. It is conceivable that the new military requirements generated by the
                        Czech crisis may aggravate the resource allocations problem and thus add to
                        Soviet incentives to seek strategic arms limitations. The Soviets may
                        consider that their occupation of Czechoslovakia and new uncertainties about
                        the contributions of their allies will require further strengthening of
                        Soviet forces in the European forward area and the reinforcement of their
                        general purpose forces in the western <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                        These requirements, in addition to the ongoing buildup of military forces
                        along the Chinese border, will probably lead to substantial increases in
                        Soviet theater forces in general. The cost of meeting these demands will add
                        to the current record high level of defense spending that already appears to
                        be generating potentially serious economic problems. The Soviets may thus at
                        this time be interested in strategic arms control as a way of conserving
                        some economic resources for other military programs and also as a way of
                        relieving strains in the economy generally. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Factors Affecting the Course of Negotiations </p>
                    <p>14. Soviet willingness to enter into arms control talks with the US does not,
                        of course, signify a firm commitment to strive for an agreement. In the
                        early phases, the Soviets would probably concentrate on probing the US
                        position. Should they decide to get down to serious business, the
                        negotiations would inevitably be hard and prolonged. </p>
                    <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0773"/>
                    <p>15. The political climate at the time of talks, and developments on the
                        international scene which might affect it for better or worse, would have a
                        considerable bearing on success or failure. There will be the usual
                        suspicion and mistrust on the Soviet side, and the problem of breaking
                        through resisting layers of bureaucracy to get decisions will be
                        particularly formidable in view of the complexity of the issues. It is
                        likely also that there will be divisions among the top leaders, and that
                        politicking for future place and power will figure in the positions they
                        adopt. Thus, the obstacles to actual achievement of an agreement will be
                        great, especially in the absence of some simultaneous advance toward
                        resolution of the more basic East-West issues and the improved political
                        climate so generated. </p>
                    <p>16. The Soviets will approach negotiations with one basic criterion in mind:
                        they will want their right to equality in strategic forces acknowledged in
                        principle. In fact, one motive they had for accepting the US invitation to
                        negotiate was probably the belief that the US move tacitly conceded this
                        right, or at least could be so construed by them. Acknowledgment of the
                        claim to equality would be valued not merely on security grounds, but also
                        because of the implication it would carry that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was entitled to a political role in world affairs
                        equivalent to that of the US. Thus, the Soviets would be sensitive to any
                        attempt from the US side to “negotiate from strength” or to claim a
                        permanent advantage in strategic forces. </p>
                    <p>17. What in fact constitutes equality—in view of the different composition of
                        strategic forces on the two sides and their different geopolitical
                        situations—would be recognized by the Soviets as a proper subject of
                        negotiation. They would surely bargain hard and take every advantage, but
                        would probably be willing in working out the problems of equivalence to
                        consider trade-offs between different weapons systems of the two sides.
                        Their view of the nature of power would lead them to weigh other ingredients
                        than numbers of strategic weapons alone—other kinds of forces, political
                        strengths and influence—in measuring the relative power of the two sides.
                        Once involved in the negotiations, therefore, they would probably not be
                        disposed to break off merely because of difficulties encountered, and they
                        would also recognize the political costs of doing so. </p>
                    <p>18. The problem of verification which has dogged all previous disarmament
                        negotiations will persist. The Soviets will probably continue to resist
                        verification procedures which require the presence of foreign inspectors in
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Traditionally, the Soviets have
                        regarded such inspection arrangements as militarily disadvantageous and
                        politically harmful. If anything, their fear of ideological contagion is
                        currently heightened. Thus, Moscow is still unlikely to accept an arms
                        control agreement which cannot be verified primarily through national means. </p>
                    <pb n="738" xml:id="pg_738" facs="0774"/>
                    <p>19. In sum, we believe that Moscow's incentives to try for strategic arms
                        limitations and for stabilizing the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                        strategic relationship with the US are stronger now than they have been.
                        Nevertheless, the forces and institutions in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> with a vested interest in stalling and even blocking
                        movement toward arms control continue to be strong, and will weigh heavily
                        against the prospects for achieving an agreement. Moreover, the absence of a
                        political climate of mutual trust between the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could strengthen the case of those forces
                        in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> opposed to serious negotiation
                        and, in general, hamper efforts to achieve agreement. </p>

                    <p>Mr. President: </p>
                    <p>Herewith an initial comment on <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s position at the lunch he initiated.<note n="2" xml:id="d292fn2">No other record of this luncheon has been found.
                        </note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Moscow is clearly ready to go—and eager—if you can work it out. </p>
                    <p>2. Their reasons are quite similar to our own: to create a good backdrop for
                        the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> in January; to keep the momentum of
                        the work on missiles going into the next Administration; and, therefore, to
                        avoid a long delay in both the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and the
                        missile affairs. </p>
                    <p>3. Reading over the proposed joint communique statement on the missile
                            talks,<note n="3" xml:id="d292fn3">Presumably a reference to <ref target="#d287">Document 287</ref> or to an early U.S. draft joint
                            statement; not found. </note> I have two reflections: </p>
                    <p>—first, they need some staffing out by Sect. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and a few others; </p>
                    <p>—basically, they represent the kind of public commitment that might emerge;
                        although the heart of the matter will lie not in the public statement of
                        principles, but rather in the simple fact that initial positions have been
                        exchanged between the two governments and that further rational negotiation
                        can proceed early in the next Administration. </p>
                    <p>4. The heart of the matter, then, is not so much in the refinement of the
                        principles, but in persuading Nixon that this is the right course for him,
                        for the President, and for the nation. </p>
                    <pb n="739" xml:id="pg_739" facs="0775"/>
                    <p>5. With respect to a rationale for Nixon, these are key points: </p>
                    <p>—we have been working on this since January 1964, and working intensively
                        since the Glassboro sessions; </p>
                    <p>—we start with a position which is fully acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and all civilian authorities in the
                        government; </p>
                    <p>—any modifications and negotiations from that position will lie in the hands
                        of the next Administration; </p>
                    <p>—a coming to grips with this matter at an early date would make it easier to
                        get the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> through the Senate in January; </p>
                    <p>—equally important, if Nixon encourages the President to go forward with
                        this, it will virtually guarantee Soviet restraint on Berlin and Eastern
                        Europe in the first phase of his Administration because once the talks are
                        started, the Soviet Union will have a major interest in not creating
                        circumstances which would require that they be broken off. We have been
                        clear with them about both Berlin and Czechoslovakia. </p>
                    <p>6. I have no doubt that there will be those who argue to Nixon that he should
                        wait and take this matter in hand himself. I understand very well the
                        leverage we had on him on the Vietnam matter; but I am not clear what
                        leverage the President will have on this issue except: </p>
                    <p>—his power of initiative even without Nixon's assent; </p>
                    <p>—an appeal to statesmanship and self-interest. </p>

                        Disarmament—The issue now is the continuation of the conference of
                        non-nuclear powers.<note n="2" xml:id="d293fn2">
                            <ref target="#d284">See Documents 284</ref> and <ref target="#d286">286</ref>.</note> Our position is to oppose a permanent body to deal
                        with this issue. As to the talks on strategic arms limitations, the Soviets
                        have made mention of these talks but we have been non-responsive. </p>
                    <p>The President: What should we do about conducting talks on strategic arms
                        limitation? We have the Czech situation, a new Administration coming in and
                        there is uncertainty as to the possibility of achieving anything in such
                        talks. </p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJR1">Wiggins</persName>: We should proceed
                        with the talks. There is no problem about conducting a parallel
                        policy—attacking the Russians for their invasion of Czechoslovakia each
                        morning and each afternoon talking about strategic arms limitations. </p>
                    <p>The President: The President-elect has slowed down Senate ratification of the
                        non-proliferation treaty. Can we accomplish anything in strategic arms talks
                        if we do not have the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> ratified? </p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJR1">Wiggins</persName>: We can accomplish
                        something because the Russians are eager to undertake the arms talks. The
                        Russians are embarrassed by criticism of the Czech invasion. They want to
                        undertake arms talks in order to draw attention away from the Czech issue.
                        However, we should not propose a special Senate session to ratify the
                        non-proliferation treaty. </p>
                    <p>The President: Ratification to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> has a
                        bearing on the strategic arms talks. The Congressional leaders will be
                        coming here this evening to discuss whether or not to hold a special
                            session.<note n="3" xml:id="d293fn3">No record of this conversation has
                            been found. However, in a memorandum to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, November 25 at 11 p.m., Rostow
                            proposed talking points for a message to President-elect Nixon. Among
                            other things, Rostow's draft message indicated President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had decided to “leave the
                                <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> to the opening days of the next
                            session of Congress in January, at the earliest. (Both <persName corresp="#p_DEMK1">Dirksen</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> think this would be wiser than calling a
                            special session.)” (Johnson Library, National Security File, Memos to
                            the President, Rostow, Vol. 108, Box 43R)</note> The Germans have been
                        softened up by recent actions in the monetary crisis but we have no leverage
                        on them to ratify the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> because we have
                        not yet ratified. The same situation is involved with Israel. We have given
                        them the Phantom airplanes but this may not be useful in getting them to
                        accept the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> unless we have already
                        ratified. In India and Japan, those opposing the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> can argue that their countries should not act on the treaty
                        before we do. </p>
                    <p>Delaying ratification until the new Senate arrives may mean that the
                        ratification of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> is in doubt. The
                        composition of the Senate will be different. Senators <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clark</persName> and Morse will be out and Goldwater
                        will be in. <pb n="741" xml:id="pg_741" facs="0777"/>Senator <persName corresp="#p_WJR1">Russell</persName> is in doubt about the treaty and
                        his doubts may grow. Unless we act in December, we may run into trouble. </p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJR1">Wiggins</persName>: It is embarrassing
                        in the United Nations to be able to say only that we think we will ratify
                        the treaty. It would be wonderful if the treaty were ratified. </p>
                    <p>The President: Asked for a paper summarizing the attitudes in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as reported by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJR1">Wiggins</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d293fn4">Not

                            Nixon had designated Robert D. Murphy, former Deputy Under Secretary of
                            State for Political Affairs, to serve as his liaison with the White
                            House and as observer at the Department of State. See <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1968-69</hi>,
                            Book II, p. 1126. </note> It is true the Senators didn't want to come
                        back for a special session. The Czech invasion blew up earlier plans for the
                        arms talks. We should get started even if we handle the talks so as not to
                        bind a successor. It is our hope that Mr. Nixon will agree to our going
                        ahead and we have offered to have Bob Murphy as an observer on the
                        delegation. </p>

                        at Brussels changed the thinking of Europeans. The European situation is
                        different after the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting as regards
                        their doubt about bilateral or US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> arms
                        talks. </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>: It is clear that
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members do not want to return to
                        the cold war. Their concern was that a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        arms buildup might upset the movement toward detente. The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting was delayed almost to the point
                        where the Soviet invasion could not be fully exploited in an effort to get
                        them to increase their defense contribution. Most of the Soviet divisions
                        are now out of Czechoslovakia and the threat to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members is, in their minds, less than it was a few weeks
                        ago. However, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members would welcome
                            US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> arms talks. </p>
                    <p>The President: State Department officials had told him the arms talks would
                        cause trouble with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members. Secretary
                        Rusk believed that talks would trouble our allies. President-elect Nixon
                        said we should delay the talks because of the Czech invasion. A paper was
                        requested giving all the reasons why the talks should or should not be held
                        which he could use in a conversation with Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEMK1">Dirksen</persName>.<note n="7" xml:id="d293fn7">Not

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>: The Germans and
                        British want us to go ahead with the arms talk. They are prepared to have us
                        take the calculated risk that things will quiet down in Czechoslovakia. The
                        rest of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members want us to go
                        ahead but they do not want us to ask them whether we should go ahead. </p>

                    <p>The President: Bob Murphy has been told that a meeting with the Russians
                        might persuade the Soviets to pressure Egypt on the Middle East problem and
                        Hanoi on the Vietnam problem. </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>: As to whether a
                        special session on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> should be called,
                        we must make a very careful nose count before deciding. There is real
                        concern that the Senate might refuse to ratify the treaty. Senators would
                        resent a special session whereas to the arms talks, such talks would help
                        advance in the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> here and abroad. </p>
                    <p>The President: We should tell the new Administration the facts of life and
                        then they will have to take responsibility. </p>

                    <p>I. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> called me to the foreign
                        office at 11:30 a.m. this morning and made following oral statements: </p>
                    <p>“Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> in a
                        conversation with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Ambassador in
                        Washington, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, on November 25
                        of this year<note n="2" xml:id="d294fn2">At this meeting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> explored a wide range of issues. Memoranda of
                            their conversation are ibid., Country File, Europe and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>
                            Conversations, Box 227. Regarding the relationship between the issue of
                            strategic missiles and a summit, “Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> remarked that he thought in regard to the
                                <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> matter that this whole thing had
                            been agreed in principle and there would be no need to redefine the
                            question. The Secretary said that he agreed as far as the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> was concerned, but he thought that what
                            was involved was a judgment by both of them as to whether or not at this
                            particular time a meeting would be useful.” (Ibid.) A memorandum of
                            their conversation on the nonproliferation treaty is in Department of
                            State, Central Files, DEF 18-6.</note> touched on a number of questions
                        which, in the opinion of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, could be discussed in the event of his meeting with
                        Soviet leaders. </p>
                    <p>“In conformity with the desire expressed by <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> to learn the opinion of the Soviet side with respect to
                        these questions, we would like to report the following for transmission to
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>:</p>
                    <pb n="743" xml:id="pg_743" facs="0779"/>
                    <p>1. We proceed from the fact that, concerning the limitation of the strategic
                        arms race, there was agreement in the course of the preceding exchange of
                        opinions between us, on a sufficient number of concrete propositions
                        regarding common goals and basic principles for limiting and subsequently
                        reducing strategic weapons, the approval of which would be completed by a
                        discussion of this question at a possible meeting. As far as we understand,
                        our detailed considerations on this subject, handed to the Secretary of
                        State on October 2 of this year,<note n="3" xml:id="d294fn3">
                            <ref target="#d287">Document 287</ref>.</note> were positively received
                        on the American side. For our part we are ready as before to review the
                        stated considerations as a basis for the achievement of an initial,
                        principled agreement on this subject. </p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of the Middle East and Vietnam.] </p>
                    <p>In the event the American side has any other additional considerations which
                        it would like to express in connection with the consideration of the
                        question of the possible arranging of a meeting between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and the Soviet leaders, we are
                        ready of course to hear them and to take such considerations into account
                        before final decision on this question.”</p>
                    <p>II. I said that you were sending me the exchange of correspondence on missile
                        talks, but I had not yet received it. I asked if it was Soviet idea that at
                        possible meeting an agreement on principles to guide missile talks would be
                        reached and embodied in some sort of declaration or communique and that this
                        would then be followed by detailed negotiations. He said that was his
                        understanding. </p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of the Middle East.] </p>
                    <p>IV. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> has not been able to
                        reach Moscow because of bad weather here. I therefore told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> for his background that I
                        understood we were thinking of December 16 and 17 in Geneva. He said he was
                        not in a position to comment. </p>
                    <p>V. Indicating I was speaking without instructions I said that a two-day
                        meeting would leave little time for any consultation by the principles with
                        their government and that it seemed to me that the more advance preparation
                        the better. He nodded, but did not comment. </p>
                    <p>VI. You will note statement referred to Soviet leaders in the plural. I will
                        try to find out from <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> whom
                        they have in mind. </p>

                                memorandum to the President under cover of a December 2 note, which
                                noted <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>'s “strong case
                                for beginning strategic talks with the Soviets at the heads of
                                government level, followed by working level talks,” and continued:
                                “If I may say so, the problem with working level talks (as opposed
                                to simply exchanging positions and asking some initial clarifying
                                questions) is: </p>
                            <p>“—We will have to take some time to study throughout the government
                                the Soviet paper; </p>
                            <p>“—We are pretty well committed not to negotiate off our initial

                            <p>“Perhaps <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clark</persName>'s point could

                            <p>“—On the second day working sessions were held to clarify the

                        <item>Strategic Talks with the Soviets </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Now that Saigon has agreed to come to Paris, I believe that the time is ripe
                        for a re-evaluation of our position on the question of holding Strategic
                        Arms Limitations Talks with the Soviet Union. In my judgment, we should move
                        forward on this matter at this time, beginning with a meeting at the heads
                        of government level, followed by working level talks. </p>
                    <p>1. If the Soviets were to accept an agreement along the lines of the one
                        unanimously recommended to you, we would maintain a substantial part of our
                        present strategic advantage; a year from now it will be much more difficult
                        to devise a proposal which takes account of existing strategic forces and is
                        in our interest. Over the next year or two, as the Soviets continue their
                        build-up of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s beyond 1200 and begin to
                        approach parity with us in Polaris-type submarines, our edge in these areas
                        will be eroded and a freeze at a later date could leave us without any
                        significant advantage. Furthermore, the Soviets may well begin to deploy
                        land-mobile systems which would greatly complicate the verification issues
                        associated with a future agreement. </p>
                    <p>2. If US-Soviet discussions have not yet begun, it is improbable that a new
                        Administration would initiate them immediately; but if Talks were already
                        underway, it is unlikely to call off the negotiations. If we do not move
                        forward <pb n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0781"/>now, I believe that it is
                        almost certain that there will be a delay of a year or more while the new
                        Administration examines this question and makes its own determination on
                        strategic policies and force procurements. </p>
                    <p>3. If we do not initiate Talks now, any future movement on this issue might
                        have to be over the objections of the Joint Chiefs rather than with their
                        concurrence. The Joint Chiefs of Staff's concurrence in the proposal stems
                        from a number of factors, including the freezing of our strategic advantage,
                        which are unlikely to be repeated at any time in the future. Moreover, under
                        a new Administration there is almost sure to be military opposition to a
                        freeze in our strategic arms until it can be seen what forces the new
                        Administration is prepared to buy in the absence of an agreement. </p>
                    <p>4. The Russian invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia need no longer delay
                        our going forward with the Strategic Talks. </p>
                    <p>a. Indications from our allies have been that they want the Talks to go
                        forward; we should, of course, inform them before any public announcement of
                        our decision to begin the Talks. The Non-Nuclear Conference which ended in
                        Geneva on September 28 unanimously passed a resolution calling upon the U.S.
                        and the Soviet Union to begin Strategic Talks. Both the FRG and Italy voted
                        in favor of this resolution. And at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Disarmament Experts Meeting during the first week of October,
                        representatives from several countries reaffirmed their Government's support
                        of this resolution, with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        representatives urging that such Talks begin “at an early date.” Denis
                        Healey of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> raised the subject with me
                        at the time of the <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss> Meeting in October,
                        expressing his belief that we should go ahead with Talks. My conversations
                        with <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> over the past two months persuade
                        me that the Germans would not object if we went ahead. Foreign Minister
                        Brandt, at the meeting of the SPD Executive Board in Bonn on November 22, is
                        reported to have said that direct Talks between the great powers should
                        continue on such matters as the limitation of strategic nuclear weapons. In
                        my report to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Nuclear Defense
                        Affairs Committee on November 14, I referred again to the importance of
                        strategic arms limitations. None of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Defense Ministers indicated any objection to the initiation of
                        Talks. Their comments stressed only the desirability of advance notice and
                        continued consultation with our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies
                        as such Talks progress. While these discussions did not focus specifically
                        on a heads of government meeting, I do not believe that our allies would
                        object to a businesslike working meeting at that level. </p>
                    <p>b. If the Talks were underway, we could use our continued participation in
                        them as a lever against further Soviet repressive measures in
                        Czechoslovakia, or as a way of deterring Soviet moves against other Eastern
                        European nations. The apparent eagerness of the Soviets for these Talks
                        makes this kind of threat seem plausible. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s remarks in his meeting with Bob McNamara <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0782"/>two weeks ago confirmed their
                        strong desire that such Talks be initiated. </p>
                    <p>5. Mr. Nixon's public statements after his meeting with you make it difficult
                        for him to object to the Talks.<note n="2" xml:id="d295fn2">For texts of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s and
                            President-elect Nixon's remarks to the press following their November 11
                            meeting at the White House, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the
                                Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon
                                    B. Johnson</persName>, 1968-69</hi>, Book II, pp. 1119-1120.
                        </note> After his meeting with you on November 11, Mr. Nixon asserted his
                        recognition of the need for continuity “on matters like Vietnam, the current
                        possible crisis in the Middle East, the relations between the United States
                        and the Soviet Union with regard to certain outstanding matters.” He said
                        that in each of these three instances “I gave assurances … to the Secretary
                        of State, and of course to the President, that they could speak not just for
                        this Administration, but for the Nation, and that meant for the next
                        Administration as well.” Accordingly, it seems likely that he would not
                        object to the opening of discussions. </p>
                    <p>6. The Heads of Government Talks should be held in Geneva and should aim at
                        political agreement on the great importance of limiting and then reducing
                        strategic forces. Opening the Talks at the summit will provide a momentum
                        which will make it difficult for either side to call off Talks without first
                        making a serious effort to reach an agreement. Moreover, agreement in
                        principle between heads of government on the urgent need to control the
                        strategic arms race will greatly facilitate discussions at the working
                        level. You might want to seek agreement with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> on a statement along the following lines: </p>
                    <p>“The President and the Prime Minister discussed their common interest in
                        reaching an agreement on the limitation and subsequent reduction of
                        strategic offensive missile systems and systems of defense against ballistic
                        missiles. They concluded that agreement on this question would be of great
                        value not only for the people of their two countries but for all mankind.
                        They directed representatives of their two governments to begin meeting
                        immediately to exchange views and proposals on this question.” </p>
                    <p>7. Talks at the Foreign Minister or Head of Delegation level should begin
                        immediately following the heads of government discussion of this issue. At
                        these talks the U.S. side would deliver the approved initial presentation of
                        our proposal and proceed to explain the proposal following the agreed set of
                        Instructions to the Delegation. The Soviets would presumably table their own
                        proposal. We could then decide how to proceed, but in any event the
                        discussions would be well launched and the prospects for an agreement
                        clearly established. </p>
                    <p>8. There now exists an appropriate occasion for moving ahead with missile
                        Talks as a means of reaffirming your undiminished interest in seeking to
                        control <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0783"/>the nuclear arms race. In
                        the present climate, criticism of this action, here and abroad, would be
                        difficult to imagine. Coupled with your decision to end the bombing of North
                        Vietnam and the start of substantive negotiations in Paris, the beginning of
                        Strategic Talks with the Soviet Union would create a momentum towards world
                        peace that would last for years to come. </p>

                                particular, I endorse the argument—which I have advanced on a number
                                of previous occasions—that the consensus within the Soviet
                                Government in favor of holding talks could well fall apart if the
                                talks are not held soon, and that this possibility partly explains
                                the eagerness of apparently committed Soviet leaders such as

                        </note> This was one of a number <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0784"/>of
                        official and unofficial Soviet attempts since the intervention in
                        Czechoslovakia to assure the US that the position of the Soviet government
                        on arms talks has not changed. Each of these attempts has stressed the
                        Soviet wish to begin talks at the earliest possible date. </p>
                    <p>The Soviets appear to have several reasons for favoring an early start on the
                        talks. One of them probably is their estimate of the strategic relationship
                        with the US—what it is now and what, in the absence of an agreement, it is
                        likely to be. Without an agreement, the Soviets will be faced with the
                        prospect of another round of rapid increases in arms spending just to keep
                        up with the US. Their alternative would be to lose some of the gains in the
                        strategic relationship recently achieved at great cost. </p>
                    <p>The Soviets, moreover, may doubt that they would be able to match the timing
                        of US technological developments in a new cycle of strategic arms increases.
                        Some leaders may believe that the longer negotiations are delayed the more
                        difficult it will be for the Soviet Union to affect the US deployment of new
                        systems at the levels called for in current US planning. </p>
                    <p>The economic arguments for avoiding a new round in the strategic arms race
                        probably have particular appeal to a Soviet leader who understands the
                        economic realities of the situation as well as <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. It is unlikely that the Soviets would be able to
                        cut other elements of defense spending sufficiently to finance large new
                        strategic programs. Substantial investment in military research and
                        development probably is considered mandatory, and the Czech crisis, the
                        Arab-Israeli war, and Sino-Soviet border tensions have created pressure to
                        beef up Soviet conventional forces. </p>
                    <p>If the Soviets set out to offset fully the impact of new US programs without
                        making compensating cuts elsewhere, annual military spending could rise 25
                        percent or more by the mid-1970's. This would force a cutback in the rate of
                        growth of consumer programs and could seriously impede long-term economic
                        growth as well. </p>
                    <p>An agreement with the US on strategic arms control could make it possible for
                        Moscow to feel that it could maintain its present strategic position without
                        going beyond current levels of military spending. The Soviets could then
                        continue recently expanded consumer programs and free some of the gains in
                        future production for the badly needed modernization of the economy. At the
                        same time, more resources could be made available for the conventional
                        forces, a vigorous research and development program could be continued, and
                        existing strategic weapons systems could be improved within the provisions
                        of an arms limitation agreement. </p>
                    <p>There are, however, some signs that the consensus within the leadership that
                        led to the decision to agree to US proposals for arms talks was <pb n="749" xml:id="pg_749" facs="0785"/>not a particularly strong one. If so,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> may have an additional
                        reason to wish to get the talks under way as soon as possible. He may
                        believe that if there is no progress on this subject in the near future,
                        other factors at home and abroad may intervene and prevent negotiations. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Soviet Initiatives </p>
                    <p>1. In a number of recent private contacts with US officials and private
                        citizens with official contacts, spokesmen for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> have emphasized that the Czechoslovak crisis should not
                        obscure the desirability of discussing strategic arms limitation or unduly
                        delay the initiation of the talks. Publicly, the Soviets have stated in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> their willingness to begin talks at
                        once. </p>
                    <p>2. The recent Soviet initiatives might be interpreted as reflecting no more
                        than a general desire to normalize relations with the US in the wake of the
                        invasion of Czechoslovakia. The frequency—there have been about half a dozen
                        contacts since September—and general tone of urgency, however, suggest that
                        there may be more specific reasons. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Shaky Consensus </p>
                    <p>3. It was not easy for Moscow to clear away its doubts about achieving
                        security objectives through diplomatic means, and it apparently continues to
                        have trouble in resolving all the diverse issues which underlie its position
                        on arms limitation discussions. The consensus that culminated in <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s June announcement of Soviet
                        willingness to talk probably was shaky at best and recent events, notably
                        the Czech crisis, may have subjected it to additional strains. </p>
                    <p>4. Externally, most signs point to continuity of the official position
                        expressed in the early summer. These signs are coming primarily from
                        officials and organs responsible to the government apparatus—principally
                        from the foreign ministry and from <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> himself. Other signs from internal Soviet political and
                        military forums suggest some continuing opposition to the idea of arms talks
                        or to the scope of the talks as they were defined earlier this year.
                        Lingering misgivings almost certainly remain in the minds of some Soviet
                        political leaders and interest groups—especially the military-industrial
                        complex and the ideological apparatus—about the desirability of achieving a
                        strategic arms agreement with the US.</p>
                    <p>5. Since Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s
                        announcement in June of the Soviet agreement to discuss strategic arms
                        limitations, the Soviet military press has frequently handled references to
                        arms talks differently than the government and party press. The most recent
                        example was Red Star's deletion of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s 3 October remarks in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on strategic arms limitations. Such editorial selectivity
                        demonstrates the military's lack of enthusiasm for the talks, but may also
                        reflect an attempt on the part of some in the military establishment to
                        reopen the issue for reconsideration <pb n="750" xml:id="pg_750" facs="0786"/>in Moscow's highest policy-making councils, now that the Czechoslovak
                        crisis has held up the talks. </p>
                    <p>6. The treatment given in the Soviet press to Politburo member Mazurov's 6
                        November anniversary speech may also indicate that the talks—or some aspect
                        of the scope of the negotiations—remain a sensitive issue. The party,
                        government, and military press all deleted a statement in the broadcast
                        version of Mazurov's speech which expressed readiness “to negotiate with the
                        United States on the whole complex of these questions.” </p>
                    <p>7. The offer to “negotiate” the basic issues was diluted by Soviet <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representative <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName> on 28 November<note n="3" xml:id="d296fn3">Text of
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAA4">Roshchin</persName>'s statement to the
                            First Committee of the U.N. General Assembly, November 28, is in
                                <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1968</hi>, pp. 739-747. </note> when he reaffirmed
                        Soviet readiness to “start a serious exchange of opinions on this question.”
                        This weaker formulation was reported in Pravda on 29 November. Mazurov's
                        speech had already represented a step backward in that it merely referred to
                        “the strategic means of delivering nuclear weapons” and omitted the phrase
                        “both offensive and defensive, including antimissile systems” found in
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s statements in June and
                        October. </p>
                    <p>8. Although Soviet <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representative Malik
                        repeated the more inclusive <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        formulation in his <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> address on 13 November,
                        the Moscow press failed to report the fact. The Kremlin's public posture on
                        the scope of the talks, insofar as the domestic audience is concerned, has
                        therefore shifted back to that which prevailed before the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had indicated its readiness to discuss
                        the subject of strategic arms limitation. </p>
                    <p>9. Evidence of high-level byplay at a time when the official government
                        policy is to push the talks suggests that the decision taken in Moscow six
                        months ago to explore the US position is by no means a firm one. If so, it
                        would explain in part the sense of urgency that Kosygin and other Soviet
                        officials have been communicating to their US audiences. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> may believe that if there is no
                        progress on this subject soon, other factors at home and abroad may
                        intervene and prevent negotiations. </p>
                    <p>10. However fragile the consensus may be, there appear to be good reasons,
                        both military and economic, for diverse elements of the Soviet leadership to
                        see potential advantages in an arms limitation agreement at this juncture. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The US-Soviet Strategic Balance </p>
                    <p>11. The prospect of a decline in the Soviet strategic position relative to
                        the US probably was a major consideration in Moscow's decision to enter into
                        the talks. </p>
                    <p>12. As a result of concerted efforts since 1965, the relative strategic
                        position of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has improved
                        significantly and Soviet leaders are <pb n="751" xml:id="pg_751" facs="0787"/>probably confident that they now possess a secure deterrent. Programmed
                        improvements to US strategic forces, however, threaten to increase the
                        relative US advantage once again, a prospect which Soviet leaders probably
                        find difficult to accept. Those favoring arms talks may consider that they
                        have come close to strategic equality with the US and that now is the most
                        propitious time to explore the possibility of negotiating a halt or a pause
                        in the competition for strategic arms. </p>
                    <p>13. Should arms limitation talks fail, decisions on new programs must be made
                        soon. Soviet leaders are aware that the US is actively developing new
                        strategic weapons systems at a time when the major Soviet strategic
                        deployment programs are nearing completion. The new US systems—the Minuteman
                        III <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, the Poseidon SLBM,and the
                        Sentinel <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>—are programmed for deployment
                        over the next few years. If they wish to offset the impact of these
                        programs, the Soviets probably would conclude that they must deploy costly
                        new strategic systems such as <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>'s and
                        mobile <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s and undertake a large <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> program.</p>
                    <p>14. The Soviets may doubt their ability to match the US over the whole range
                        of technological development for advanced systems—<gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, etc.—if they do
                        choose to compete. They might also believe that continued delays in
                        initiating the negotiations—while US weapons testing is continuing—could
                        impair their ability to negotiate effectively on future levels of deployment
                        of advanced systems. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Arms and the Economy </p>
                    <p>15. Economic considerations undoubtedly provided another of the major
                        incentives that led the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to agree in
                        June to discuss strategic arms limitation with the US, and also probably lie
                        behind its current interest in initiating the talks in the near future. It
                        seems clear that major decisions on basic economic policy must be made soon
                        and translated into specific plans for directing the course of the economy
                        through the mid-1970's. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Resource Allocation Issues </p>
                    <p>16. For the past several years, the Soviets have been following a policy of
                        expanding strategic military programs and increasing investment in the
                        consumer sector of the economy while allowing the rate of growth of
                        investment in heavy industry to decline. </p>
                    <p>17. Following three years of relative stability in defense spending in
                        1963-65, military outlays began to rise sharply. Total expenditures for
                        military and space programs increased at an average annual rate of 7 percent
                        during 1966 and 1967. More important from the standpoint of resource
                        allocations, most of this increase reflected growth in advanced weapons and
                        space programs which absorb the highest quality manpower and machinery. As a
                        result, military hardware purchases and <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0788"/>spending for military R&amp;D and space grew an average
                        of 10 percent per year. </p>
                    <p>18. At the same time, investment in the consumer sector of the economy has
                        also accelerated markedly. Since 1964, total consumer-oriented
                        investment—including agriculture—has grown at an average rate of more than 9
                        percent, more than double the rate of the previous five years. </p>
                    <p>19. The expansion of consumer and strategic programs have come at the expense
                        of investment in the heavy industry sector—i.e. at some cost to future
                        economic growth. The average annual growth of investment in heavy industry
                        fell to about 5 percent in the 1965-67 period, even below the low rates
                        experienced in the early 1960's. </p>
                    <p>20. Preliminary information on the performance of the Soviet economy in 1968
                        suggests that the effects of this policy are beginning to show up in a
                        decline in the rate of growth of heavy industry output. If this decline is a
                        direct result of the slighting of investment rather than a short-term
                        phenomenon, then the pressure on industrial growth rates could become more
                        acute during the next year or two as the full effects of the recent
                        investment policy take hold. In either case, the current performance would
                        give the Soviet economic planners reason for concern. </p>
                    <p>21. The Soviet leaders now appear to be faced with this prospect: they must
                        restore a higher rate of growth of investment in heavy industry in the near
                        future or risk impairing future capacity for satisfying military as well as
                        civilian objectives. The important question is which claimant is going to
                        yield—the consumer or the military—and by how much and when? In the past the
                        choice would have been easier to predict: the Soviet consumer has
                        traditionally borne the brunt of any resource squeeze. Now, however, the
                        political cost of cutting back consumer programs could be greater. </p>
                    <p>22. These issues are apparently very much on the mind of Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in particular. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> emphasized his concern for the
                        economic aspects of the arms race in a meeting with the president of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Board of Trade in June, and he was
                        apparently eager to convey a similar message to former Defense Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and to Senators
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAE2">Gore</persName> and Pell in Moscow last

                    </p>
                    <p>23. As leader of the government, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> is responsible for the performance of the Soviet
                        economy. His experience and the approach he appears to take on the issues of
                        the day would probably predispose him, more than most Soviet military
                        planners or Communist Party leaders, to weigh military programs against
                        long-term economic growth prospects <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0789"/>and to look to diplomatic means to avoid unnecessary sacrifice of future
                        strength to present power. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Outlook </p>
                    <p>24. Soviet leaders undoubtedly realize that an arms limitation agreement
                        would not result in large immediate savings or relief from present military
                        spending levels. They probably hope, however, that it would obviate the need
                        for the large annual increments in outlays that a new round in the arms race
                        would surely entail. If military expenditures could be stabilized at their
                        current level, the entire annual growth in production would be available for
                        other objectives. This relaxation of the military's claim on the growth in
                        output would probably be enough to allow the Soviets to continue their
                        increased consumer-oriented investment programs and at the same time
                        maintain the minimum adequate investment in heavy industry. </p>
                    <p>25. The economic effects of an agreement cannot be calculated precisely under
                        present uncertainties concerning future Soviet military programs, both with
                        and without an agreement. A general appreciation of the magnitude of
                        resources involved can be obtained, however, by comparing present levels of
                        spending against what would be required if they seek to establish
                        across-the-board equality with the US on a priority basis. Such an objective
                        could easily raise annual Soviet defense spending by about 25 percent or 5
                        billion rubles by the mid-1970's. </p>
                    <p>26. Annual increases of about a billion rubles a year for 5 years would
                        represent an annual growth in defense outlays comparable to that of 1966 and
                        1967. Such allocations would almost certainly force cutbacks in the rate of
                        growth of consumer programs. Should the Soviets choose instead to continue
                        to neglect the heavy industry sector over the next several years, they would
                        be doing so at the cost of seriously impairing capacity for satisfying the
                        whole range of national objectives several years hence. </p>
                    <p>27. The resources represented by 5 billion rubles are large in relation to
                        the Soviet economic activity. For example, 5 billion rubles compares with
                        current investment programs as follows: </p>
                    <p>—It is nearly equal to current annual expenditures for construction of
                        weapons systems sites plus purchases of all military weapons and equipment. </p>
                    <p>—It is about three times as much as 1967 fixed investment in the iron and
                        steel industry. </p>
                    <p>—It is twice as much as 1967 investment in all consumer goods industries. </p>
                    <p>—It is about as much as recent annual expenditures for plant and equipment
                        for the rapidly expanding chemical and machinery sectors combined. </p>
                    <p>—It equals about one-third of 1967 fixed investment in heavy industry. </p>
                    <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0790"/>
                    <p>28. The Soviets probably would not feel that they could cut other elements of
                        defense spending sufficiently to finance the required new strategic
                        programs. A continuation of their large military research and development
                        program probably is considered mandatory to maintaining strategic strength,
                        and recent events indicate that expenditures for general purpose forces are
                        more likely to increase than decrease. The Czech crisis, the Arab-Israeli
                        war, and Sino-Soviet border tensions have all created pressure for enhancing
                        the Soviet conventional warfare capability. </p>
                    <p>29. Stabilization of defense expenditures at the current level—the highest in
                        Soviet history—would imply a continued major commitment of economic
                        resources to military programs. It probably would provide an adequate base
                        for maintaining a large military research and development program,
                        modernizing the general purpose forces, and—within the provisions of an arms
                        limitation agreement—improving strategic weapons systems. </p>
                    <p>30. The Soviets are now drafting the next five-year economic plan, which will
                        cover the 1971-75 period. They probably hope to have a preliminary version
                        completed in 1969 and a final version ready by mid-1970. It will be
                        difficult for the Soviets to proceed very far in the planning process until
                        they have established a fairly firm view of the nature of their future
                        strategic weapons programs. The Soviets probably believe that it will take
                        considerable time for the substance of a final agreement to emerge, and
                        consequently they have a strong incentive to get the talks under way
                    soon.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Dear <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Glenn</persName>:</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your views regarding the cutoff of production of fissionable
                        materials for use in weapons.<note n="2" xml:id="d298fn2">
                            <ref target="#d290">Document 290</ref>.</note> We will be most
                        interested in seeing the terms of reference and the results of the study
                        which the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> is undertaking of the ability
                        of the U.S. to meet foreseeable requirements for fissionable material and
                        tritium under conditions of a cutoff.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> is looking at this problem and has
                        also requested that a review of the present U.S. position on cutoff and
                        transfer proposals be made by the Committee of Principals. To this end, I
                        have requested my staff to prepare an updated paper that sets forth the
                        present U.S. position and our proposed modification of the verification
                        aspects. In this connection, the intelligence community is preparing an
                        evaluation of our ability to detect, by unilateral means, clandestine plants
                        in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which could produce significant
                        additions to the existing Soviet stockpiles of fissionable material. I have
                        delayed answering your letter of October 9, 1968, because I had hoped to
                        have data from this evaluation which I could send on for your use. I will
                        forward it to you, along with other material which we are assembling, at a
                        later date.</p>
                    <p>We will consider the range of alternative actions which you outlined in the
                        last paragraph of your letter in reformulating our alternative proposal of a
                        plant-by-plant “shutdown.” Our draft will emphasize the efforts already
                        taken by the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> in cutting back on
                        production. My staff representatives will coordinate with yours on this

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I gather from Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> that both you
                        and he are now cool to the possibility of a Summit on missiles; and I would
                        guess that Moscow is also cool.</p>
                    <p>The reasons are ample:</p>
                    <p>—time is short;</p>
                    <p>—we could not go far beyond the exchange of positions and papers;</p>
                    <p>—we would have to brief in Rogers and Laird;</p>
                    <p>—we would have <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consultation problems</p>
                    <p>Every normal argument is for leaving it to Nixon. And that may be the correct
                        course.</p>
                    <p>But it may also be a decision we shall regret more than any other in the
                        years ahead.<note n="2" xml:id="d299fn2">The President has circled the words
                            “we shall regret more” and drawn an arrow to the margin where he wrote,
                            “I agree.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Nuclear agreements are always marginal and tough. If we do not hold the
                        meeting, the new administration may let the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and missiles slip in priority. Time will pass. Men and
                        situations will change. And mankind may move down the wrong fork in the road
                        for what will, with hindsight, look like relatively trivial reasons.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I suggest that the President and Secretary of State make one more
                        assessment of <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and missile talk prospects
                        in the Nixon administration, before abandoning the concept finally.<note n="3" xml:id="d299fn3">The President has also circled much of this
                            sentence and drawn a line down to the same “I agree” referenced

                        draft which we recently received but has been cast in the form of a Joint
                        Statement and has been altered to the minimum extent necessary to meet the
                        five points made in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>'s memorandum concerning it.<note n="3" xml:id="d300fn3">
                            <ref target="#d288">Document 288</ref>.</note> The draft and this
                        memorandum have been discussed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Four of these five points have been met completely; one has been met in
                        substance. This latter point is that the first and second principles in the
                        Soviet draft phrase the scope of projected arrangements somewhat
                        differently, the first indicating that they should deal with “offensive and
                        defensive weapons systems" and the second indicating they should deal with
                        “offensive strategic nuclear weapons delivery systems and anti-ballistic
                        missile systems.” The point is made that the second principle would cover
                        manned bombers but not bomber defenses and the suggestion is made that the
                        second principle be dropped. This point is well taken but, consistent with
                        the principle of minimum changes, it has been met by melding the two
                        principles together and using the phrase “offensive and defensive weapons
                        systems" throughout. You should be aware, however, that the phrase being
                        eliminated, “offensive strategic nuclear weapons delivery systems and
                        anti-ballistic missile systems" was used in your July 1 statement as well as
                        the resolutions of the Conference of Non-Nuclear Weapon States and of the
                        General Assembly of the United Nations on this subject.</p>
                    <p>One point made in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>'s
                        memorandum and incorporated in the attached draft has implications of which
                        you should be aware. This is the point that focuses on the fact that the
                        third principle in <pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0795"/>the Soviet draft
                        contains the statement that “… equal security should be assured for both
                        sides.” The point is made (which closely relates to the first point in the
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> memorandum) that the intent may be
                        to provide for substantial adjustments in the strategic arms balance. The
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> memorandum takes the position that,
                        in view of the fact that our forces are not symmetrical and that our
                        security needs differ, we should eliminate the word “equal" on the grounds
                        that it is tautological because the notion of security being “equal" is
                        involved in the very concept of security itself. Perhaps a related reason
                        for the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> objection is a general objection
                        to the word “equal" because of overtones of “equality" or “parity.”</p>
                    <p>Based on a conversation he has had with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> is concerned that the Soviets are
                        attempting to use this principle in order to obtain agreement, in principle,

                    <p>In putting the language back up to the Soviets with the “equal" eliminated,
                        we might be running a risk that the Soviets would reply by pointing out that
                        paragraph 5 of the McCloy-<persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> Joint
                        Statement of Agreed Principles for Disarmament Negotiations, September 20,
                        1961, states that “all measures of general and complete disarmament should
                        be balanced so that at no stage in the treaty could any State or group of
                        States gain military advantage and that security is ensured equally for
                        all.” This might weaken somewhat the argument based on tautology or
                        redundancy. But read in its entirety, the phrase “so balanced that neither
                        side could obtain any military advantage" is sufficiently comprehensive so
                        that the Soviets might be trying to get something else with the concept of
                        “equal security”, and I am not at all sure that we should regard a 1961
                        formulation as controlling.</p>

                        agreement that special delegations should meet promptly to work out an
                        agreement, has been put in brackets. This is to bring to your attention the
                        concern that some have felt that it might be difficult to live up to such an
                        agreement in light of the limited time available between now and January
                        20th, 1969. This is a matter on which I would, of course, defer to your
                        judgment.</p>

                        THE LIMITATION AND SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN STRATEGIC ARMAMENTS</p>
                    <p>The President of the United States of America and the Chairman of the Council
                        of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have exchanged views
                        during the last few years on the question of restraining the strategic arms
                        race. </p>
                    <p>In the last few months of this exchange they took note of the action of the
                        Conference of Non-Nuclear Weapon States and of the XXIIId General Assembly
                        of the United Nations urging the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist
                        Republics and of the United States of America to enter into bilateral
                        discussions on the limitation of offensive and defensive strategic armaments
                        at an early date. </p>
                    <p>As a result of the exchange of views on this subject, the two sides have
                        arrived at a conclusion on the desirability and feasibility of achieving a
                        mutually acceptable understanding on this question. They have also arrived
                        at a conclusion that the implementation of measures to restrain the
                        strategic arms race would serve the interests of both countries as well as
                        the interests of strengthening international security, and that this would
                        also generate more favorable conditions for solving other major issues in
                        the field of disarmament.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that there should be established basic principles affecting the
                        limitation and subsequent reduction in strategic armaments and that the
                        general objectives of our two countries in this field should be formulated.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, it was agreed that the two sides would be guided by the
                        following general objectives:</p>
                    <p>—To maintain a stable U.S.-Soviet strategic deterrence by agreed limitations
                        on the deployment of offensive and defensive strategic armaments.</p>
                    <p>—To enhance the credibility of our efforts to prevent the destabilizing
                        actions of other nations by demonstrating Soviet and U.S. willingness to
                        limit their strategic armaments.</p>
                    <pb n="761" xml:id="pg_761" facs="0797"/>
                    <p>—To provide mutual assurance to each of us that our security will be
                        maintained, while at the same time avoiding the tensions, uncertainties, and
                        costs of an unrestrained continuation of the strategic arms race.</p>
                    <p>—To improve U.S.-Soviet understanding by establishing a continuing process of
                        discussion of issues arising from the strategic situation.</p>
                    <p>At the same time it was agreed that the task of limiting and subsequently
                        reducing strategic armaments should be resolved in compliance with the
                        following basic principles:</p>
                    <p>(1) Giving due regard for the integral inter-connection of the two principal
                        components of strategic armaments, i.e., offensive and defensive weapons
                        systems, the limitation and reduction in strategic armaments should be
                        carried out as a complex including both offensive and defensive weapons
                        systems.</p>
                    <p>(2) The limitation and reduction in strategic armaments should be so balanced
                        that neither side could obtain any military advantage and that security
                        should be assured equally for both sides.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that [special delegations of]<note n="2" xml:id="d301fn2">Regarding the brackets in this paragraph, which appear in the source
                            text, see the last paragraph of <ref target="#d300">Document
                        300</ref>.2</note> the two governments, guided by the above-mentioned
                        objectives and principles, would promptly address themselves to [devising an
                        agreement on] the concrete aspects of the problem of limiting and reducing
                        strategic armaments.</p>
                    <p>It was also agreed that the two governments, along with the development of
                        measures to limit and reduce strategic armaments, would study the question
                        of taking steps to minimize the possible accidental appearance of
                        conflict-fraught situations involving the use of strategic armaments.</p>

                        judgment a significant accomplishment for those who support the
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty (<gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>). This
                        resolution incorporates the essential points of the U.S. position on <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> follow-up. It will not cause complications
                        for the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, and in effect, constitutes an

                        work together rather than in opposition on nuclear problems. This <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> session was also outstanding in demonstrating

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Resume of Negotiations on the <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> Resolution.</p>
                    <p>Early in the session, the Italian Delegation, strongly supported by Brazil,
                        Yugoslavia, and Pakistan, took the initiative in organizing a prestigious
                        group of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> delegations in order to formulate
                        a <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> resolution on the <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> which would establish a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> ad hoc committee to pursue <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> recommendations in the fields of peaceful
                        uses of nuclear energy and security assurances. Other invitees were Mexico,
                        Chile, <pb n="763" xml:id="pg_763" facs="0799"/>Argentina, India, Kenya,
                        Nigeria and Japan. Initial reactions suggested that the Italian effort would
                        be difficult to stop, particularly since many delegations (including the
                        Netherlands) were reluctant to oppose the Italian plan and thereby risk
                        exclusion from whatever committee might be established. The Japanese had
                        initially intended to suggest a resolution establishing a new committee to
                        focus on assurance, but they were dissuaded by the US from pursuing this
                        within the Italian group.</p>
                    <p>The idea of a counter-resolution effort and the first draft of the counter
                        resolution were developed by the US Delegation, which encouraged the
                        Japanese and Netherlands Delegations to establish a counter-resolution group
                        which ultimately also included Finland, Canada, Austria and Australia. At
                        the same time, the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> took an
                        extremely stiff position in the First Committee against the creation of any
                        new body. The efforts of the Italian Mission group then shifted to seeking
                        an early meeting next year of the United Nations Disarmament Commission
                            (<gloss target="#t_UNDC1">UNDC</gloss>) (an existing body) to consider
                        peaceful uses and security assurances.</p>
                    <p>The counter-resolution group, which held most of its meetings at the Finnish
                        Mission, advocated positions acceptable to the US, i.e., that no decision to
                        convene a <gloss target="#t_UNDC1">UNDC</gloss> session should be taken
                        before the XXIV <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and that there should be
                        no revision of the <gloss target="#t_UNDC1">UNDC</gloss>'s terms of
                        reference explicitly to include peaceful uses. The group accepted virtually
                        all of the recommendations of the US regarding the counter resolution and
                        disagreed on only one point. Despite US opposition, the Finnish group
                        maintained that it was essential in order to increase the chances of success
                        for the counter resolution that it “endorse" rather than “note" the
                        declaration adopted by the <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> in Geneva.
                        During a series of lengthy meetings between the Italian and Finnish groups,
                        the latter several times appeared on the verge of collapse but was propped
                        up by frequent reminders that the Italian group would have clear sailing if
                        no counter resolution survived.</p>
                    <p>The crucial turning point came on December 3 when negotiations broke down
                        between the two groups and the Finnish group tabled its draft resolution
                            (A/C.1/L.450),<note n="4" xml:id="d302fn4">Text in Documents on
                            Disarmament, 1968, pp. 761-762.</note> thus gaining the tactical
                        advantage of priority in the First Committee voting. Shortly thereafter the
                        Italian group tabled its resolution (A/C.1/L.451). Further negotiations
                        between the two groups resulted in a “compromise" resolution essentially the
                        same as that of the Finnish group and, in general, in accordance with US
                            desires.<note n="5" xml:id="d302fn5">A/C.1/L.458, December 13, which

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Relationship to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the session, the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        stressed that the establishment of a new body or a 1969 meeting of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UNDC1">UNDC</gloss> would, as a practical matter,
                        complicate and delay the acceptance and entry into force of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. Although this argument was not welcomed by
                        some of the prominent <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> abstainers, those
                        who strongly support the Treaty, e.g., the Netherlands, Finland and Canada,
                        shared our concern that the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> could be
                        prejudiced by procedural steps being pushed by the Italian group. (The
                        Italians professed throughout that only their proposals could “save" the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> by restoring the confidence of the
                        non-nuclear- weapon states that the nuclear powers would in fact live up to
                        their obligations under the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.)</p>
                    <p>The conflict between the groups regarding the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> was symbolized by the fact that the Italian Mission resolution
                        was co-sponsored by five non-signers of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Italy, and Pakistan) and only one
                        signer (Yugoslavia), a fact alluded to publicly in particularly heavy-handed
                        fashion by the Byelorussian representative. In contrast, the Finnish
                        Mission's resolution was co-sponsored by four <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> signatories (Austria, Canada, Finland, and the Netherlands),
                        and only two non-signers (Australia and Japan).</p>
                    <p>The effectiveness of the argument of the need to protect the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> was finally demonstrated when Ambassador
                        Shahi (Pakistan), an original member of the Italian groups, stated in his
                        speech introducing the final compromise resolution: “Let me give the
                        assurance, if any assurance is required, that there is no desire that the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Disarmament Commission, if it is
                        convened, should weaken the positive results which have been achieved in the
                        field of disarmament by way of the conclusion of the Non-Proliferation
                        Treaty or any other.”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Failure of Efforts to Provoke Confrontation
                        Between Nuclear and Non-Nuclear Weapon States.</p>
                    <p>When the session began, there was considerable talk, particularly among
                            non-<gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> signatories, about forcing a
                        confrontation between the nuclear and non-nuclear-weapon states. Several
                        non-nuclears insisted in the corridors that the nuclears would have no
                        choice but to join a new ad <pb n="765" xml:id="pg_765" facs="0801"/>hoc
                        committee if one was formed. However, members of the Finnish Mission group,
                        particularly the Japanese, insisted that the cooperation of the nuclear
                        powers was essential to achieve any worthwhile results in the nuclear field.
                        Throughout the lengthy negotiations between the two groups, the Finnish
                        group often rejected proposals solely on the grounds they would be
                        unacceptable to the nuclear powers, i.e., the U.S., since the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had by then taken a completely negative
                        stance. The acceptance of the final compromise resolution, which most
                        members knew the U.S. had helped develop, thus represents a recognition that
                        the cooperation of the nuclear powers is essential to progress in the fields
                        of peaceful uses and disarmament.</p>
                    <p>One of the most significant results of this session would appear to be a
                        setback for, and possibly even the burial of, the idea that the non-nuclears
                        can or should organize themselves as a political force, as some attempted at
                        the <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss>, for the purpose of confrontation
                        with the nuclear powers. It is also significant that the stress on the need
                        to protect the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, in the end, contributed
                        to unifying, rather than dividing, the members of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> who overwhelmingly supported the final compromise
                        resolution.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Role of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The United States effort was fundamentally assisted by our ability early in
                        Committee deliberations to propose an attractive compromise position which
                        we could then stand by. (The U.S. Delegation appreciates the efforts in
                        Washington which resulted in timely and helpful instructions.) The U.S.
                        Delegation's corridor activities were, unavoidably, conspicuously visible.
                        Nevertheless, the members of the Finnish group appeared to welcome the
                        frequency and frankness of their contacts with the U.S. Delegation. Although
                        initially disagreements between the U.S. and a few other delegations,
                        particularly the Italian, appeared fairly sharp, when the final compromise
                        resolution was adopted, there were no appearances of resentment against the
                        U.S. by the Italian group. Members of the Brazilian and Italian Delegations
                        said they were satisfied with the final result.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Role of the Non-Nuclears.</p>
                    <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>. The Italians invested considerable effort
                        in promoting a new ad hoc body, as evidenced in part by the heavy
                        reinforcement of their Delegation with senior officials from Rome and
                        Geneva. Because the Italians pursued their aims in company with a number of
                        other prestigious delegations, failure to achieve their main objective, the
                        establishment of a new committee, did not stand out as a purely Italian
                        failure (in contrast to the picture perceived by all in the Italian attempt
                        to amend the Outer Space Treaty).</p>
                    <pb n="766" xml:id="pg_766" facs="0802"/>
                    <p>(b) <hi rend="italic">Pakistan</hi>. The Pakistanis made a strong effort to
                        preserve their image as the promoters of the <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss>. They volunteered to be the rapporteurs for the Italian Mission
                        group and introduced the final <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss>
                        compromise resolution even though this resolution was largely the product of
                        the Finnish group.</p>
                    <p>(c) Brazil. Castro, though widely understood to be strongly sympathetic to
                        the Italian group's efforts, did not permit himself to be identified as a
                        leader of the group. His behavior contrasts sharply with what we understand
                        was a heavy-handed performance by da Silveira at the <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> in Geneva.</p>
                    <p>(d) <hi rend="italic">Yugoslavia</hi>. The Yugoslavs expressed discomfort at
                        participating in the Italian Mission group with so many prominent
                        non-signatories of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. They hung on,
                        however, in an effort to make some mark on the question of security
                        assurances.</p>
                    <p>(e) <hi rend="italic">India</hi>. The Indian Delegation worked actively on
                        both sides of the street. It remained in the Italian group, but allowed the
                        impression to develop that it would welcome the success of the Finnish
                        group's efforts, providing there was no mention of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> in the preamble of the Finnish resolution.
                        (Members of the Finnish group felt considerable annoyance when, after
                        deleting all references to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, they did
                        not wind up with Indian co-sponsorship for the final compromise resolution.)</p>
                    <p>The initial Indian concern focused on Pakistan's role. India had considerable
                        misgivings about the creation of any ad hoc committee since this would
                        clearly give Pakistan a major role; but India was even more strongly
                        determined to be on any committee that might be set up and therefore stayed
                        with the Italian group until its failure was assured. A Pakistani delegate
                        delivered himself of several pronouncements to others that India had again
                        played its traditional game of deceit.</p>
                    <p>(f) <hi rend="italic">Mexico</hi>. Garcia Robles kept his eyes riveted
                        throughout on objectives of primary concern to Mexico, i.e., the endorsement
                        by the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> of the <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> resolution on the Latin American Nuclear Free Zone and
                        authorization for a <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> study on <gloss target="#t_PNE1">PNE</gloss> services. Both of these ideas were
                        initially embedded in the Italian Mission draft resolution. When it became
                        apparent that the Italian resolution might not be the one finally adopted,
                        Garcia Robles lost no time in launching separate initiatives to achieve his
                        aims. Although he was successful, we heard a number of expressions of
                        irritation at his performance. Garcia Robles' position appeared particularly
                        strong because of his traditional hold on Latin American votes. Mexico's
                        participation in the Italian group, along with Brazil, Argentina, and Chile,
                        gave the impression that the Latin Americans would vote as a bloc for any
                        product of the Italian group.</p>
                    <p>(g) <hi rend="italic">The Netherlands</hi>. Eschauzier played an active and
                        constructive role in the Finnish group, despite the fact that he clearly
                        felt vulnerable to pressures from the Italians because of his Government's
                        desire to maintain <pb n="767" xml:id="pg_767" facs="0803"/>the cooperation
                        of the Italian Government in various European projects.</p>
                    <p>(h) <hi rend="italic">Finland</hi>. Jakobson was a strong member of his
                        group's negotiating team; he was unquestionably inhibited, however, by the
                        fact that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might not support (and
                        in the event did not support) his group's compromise resolution.</p>
                    <p>(i)<hi rend="italic"> Australia</hi>. The Australians (<persName corresp="#p_SJP2">Shaw</persName> and Evans) played a vigorous and
                        effective role in stiffening the spine of the Finnish group. We have the
                        impression from several conversations that the Australian <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Delegation wished to turn in a helpful
                        performance in order to compensate somewhat for Australia's failure so far
                        to sign the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>(j) <hi rend="italic">Japan</hi>. Ogiso played a key role, in very close
                        contact with the U.S. Delegation, in developing the counter-resolution
                        effort. This was a particularly ticklish task because the Japanese <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mission, before Ogiso's arrival in New York,
                        had accepted an invitation to participate in the effort of the Italian
                        Mission group. (<gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> believes it would be
                        warranted, assuming Embassy Tokyo thinks it appropriate, for the Embassy to
                        express to Ogiso, and perhaps also to his superiors, the U.S. Delegation's
                        appreciation for the most constructive and skillful role played by the
                        Japanese Delegation and particularly Ogiso.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Role of the Developing Countries (<gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s).</p>
                    <p>A curious feature of the struggle over the <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> resolution was that the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s,
                        and particularly the Africans, remained almost totally on the sidelines
                        while two groups of relatively advanced countries argued privately about
                        formulation of their resolutions. Although a number of influential and
                        responsible <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s were courted, especially
                        by the Finnish group, they refrained from active participation.</p>
                    <p>An interesting insight was provided when Pinera (Chile), an activist within
                        the Italian Mission group, was overheard to tell Kolo (Nigeria) that the
                        Italian group was attempting to promote the interests of the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s. Kolo responded tartly that in fact the
                        Italian group was telling the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s what
                        ought to be good for them rather than actually obtaining their
                        participation. Kolo's remark is less than fair, however, since both the
                        Nigerian and Kenyan Delegations were initially invited to participate in the
                        Italian Mission deliberations. The Kenyan Delegation never showed up and the
                        Nigerian Delegation only appeared for the first few meetings. The Ethiopians
                        were completely inactive.</p>
                    <p>The great mass of <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s were, in fact,
                        content to accept in total the results ironed out by the Italian and Finnish
                        groups. We are virtually certain that the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s would have accepted any result achieved by the two groups.
                        The <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s disinterest probably was equally a
                        mixture of their desire to avoid making a difficult choice and their feeling
                        that the details <pb n="768" xml:id="pg_768" facs="0804"/>of nuclear issues
                        are much more remote from them than are many other matters with which they

                        apparently took an extremely negative and tough stance against any <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> resolution that gave stature to <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> results. Moreover, it eventually became
                        clear that the Soviets, who had resorted to the transparent maneuver of

                        and to other international organizations concerned.” The compromise
                        resolution uses the formula “to the Governments of States Members of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and members of its specialized

                        international bodies concerned.”) This probably explains why the Hungarians,
                        joined by the Soviets, felt compelled to insist on voting, which they lost,
                        on the question of priority between their resolution and the final
                        compromise resolution.</p>
                    <p>When the session was concluded, the Soviets and their allies, who voted
                        against the compromise resolution, were completely isolated. (The other
                        nuclear powers, including specifically France, voted in favor of the
                        compromise resolution.) The introduction of the Soviet-inspired resolution
                        was tactically useful, however, in that it permitted the U.S. and others to
                        argue that the Finnish Mission resolution was a genuine compromise between
                        the extreme positions staked out by the Italian and the Bulgarian-Hungarian
                        resolutions.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Absence of Pressure for Further Assurances.</p>
                    <p>Despite the attention it received at the <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss>,
                        the issue of security assurances did not come to life at the XXIII <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. There was, of course, considerable grumbling
                        that the security situation is far from satisfactory. However, we were not
                        confronted by proposals of new formulas for positive assurances or for
                        non-use of nuclear weapons, and virtually no interest at all was shown in
                        introducing or adopting the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> resolution on the non-use of force.</p>
                    <p>The desire to have the proposed ad hoc committee or the <gloss target="#t_UNDC1">UNDC</gloss> take up this question was pressed only by
                        Yugoslavia and Brazil. Although at the outset of the session the Brazilian
                        Foreign Minister had proposed a special conference on security, the
                        Brazilian Delegation displayed <pb n="769" xml:id="pg_769" facs="0805"/>no
                        initiative whatever in pursuing this idea which thereafter was quietly
                        buried. The security issue was reduced to a passing reference in the final

                    <p>The US views on security assurances appear to have gained some ground.

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Reasons for Less Interest in Assurances.</p>
                    <p>There are several probable reasons for this lessened interest in assurances:</p>
                    <p>(a) The Czech invasion demonstrated that nuclear weapons are not the only or
                        necessarily the most relevant element of military power that can affect the
                        security and independence of smaller states.</p>
                    <p>(b) Many countries appreciate our point that the time is not propitious for
                        further efforts with the Soviets towards additional assurances.</p>
                    <p>(c) The Soviets did not pursue vigorously their non-use proposal, partly to
                        avoid trouble for the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, partly to keep
                        the Czech situation from being dragged into the disarmament debate, and
                        partly to avoid the possibility of ending up with a <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> resolution that would be some variant of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> resolution on non-use of force.</p>
                    <p>(d) The states traditionally concerned with assurances, such as Yugoslavia,
                        appeared to be more interested in keeping this issue in front of the public
                        than in coming up with new formulas or arrangements—thus the emphasis was on
                        procedural initiatives such as handing the problem to an ad hoc committee or
                        the <gloss target="#t_UNDC1">UNDC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>(e) There appears to be wider understanding of the fact that the assurances
                        question is difficult and complex (and properly a matter for Security
                        Council consideration) and that the principal nuclear powers have gone as
                        far as they can in SC resolution 255<note n="7" xml:id="d302fn7">Submitted

                    <p>(f) Many <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members appear to appreciate that
                        greater security lies in a gradual strengthening of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the achievement of further <pb n="770" xml:id="pg_770" facs="0806"/>measures of disarmament and arms control.
                        (A member of the Yugoslav Delegation readily conceded that a pledge not to
                        use nuclear weapons would have had no relevance in deterring the Soviet
                        aggression against Czechoslovakia.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Conclusion.</p>
                    <p>It seems clear that SC resolution 255 has not put us on a “slippery slope”
                        leading to greater demands for assurances. It is equally clear that we face
                        no urgent pressure to alter our position on the assurances issue.</p>

                        without opposition (Cuba and France abstained).</p>

                    <p>A noteworthy aspect of the disarmament debate was the decision by the Soviets

                        cooperative in the wake of the invasion of Czechoslovakia, (b) to preserve

                        demonstrating that the proposals the U.S. does not like have been carefully
                        evaluated and proved impractical. Even if concrete results are not
                        extensive, evidence of efforts by the U.S. to respond to the issues
                        highlighted at the <gloss target="#t_NNC1">NNC</gloss> and active
                        participation by the U.S. in existing bodies will prevent charges that the
                        U.S. is disinterested in problems of great importance to others.</p>
