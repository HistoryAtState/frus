                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts which contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is edited by the
                    Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of State. The
                    editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in accordance
                    with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925.</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in
                    the text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                    concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons: <list type="simple">

                                destroy the effectiveness of the Communist apparatus in free world
                                countries vulnerable to Communist subversion.</p>

                        </quote></p>
                    <p>In connection with the above, I am unable to learn the basis for the
                        reference to “the current program to develop constabulary forces to maintain
                        internal security and to destroy the effectiveness of the Communist
                        apparatus in free world countries vulnerable to Communist subversion.”
                        Insofar as I know, there is no such current program.</p>
                    <p>However, I do recall that prior to General Collins’ departure for Saigon we
                        gave consideration in the Department to the formation of a constabulary as a
                        means of giving the Vietnamese Government control over security forces
                        because of the Diem–Minh conflict, Collins, however, came up with a concept
                        on the mission of the Vietnamese forces which we all thought was much
                        better. Namely, that while these forces would serve as a small blocking
                        force of “couverture” in the event of aggression, they would also have the
                            <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0034"/>basic responsibility for
                        pacification of Free Vietnam territory and the internal security of such
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>I do not think the problem can be attacked on the basis that constabulatory
                        forces per se can be the answer to internal security. What we should be
                        talking about are effective forces to maintain security whether they be
                        regular armed forces, police, special security forces, or constabulary, or a
                        combination thereof. In effect, it seems to me that the <gloss

                    <p>Our discussions in the Manila Pact Working Group have been quite interesting
                        in respect to this general subject.<note n="6" xml:id="d1fn6">The Manila
                            Pact Working Group was established in November 1954 to arrange an agenda
                            for the Bangkok Conference of February 23–25, 1955. Representatives of
                            the nations that signed the Manila Pact, September 8, 1954, later known
                            as the South East Asia Treaty Organization (<gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss>), were included in the working group and attended the
                            February conference.</note> The general consensus of the eight
                        participating countries has been that subversion, generally speaking, takes
                        the following two forms, or a combination thereof: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>

                            <item>Continued penetration into every sector of the national life
                                (government ministries such as Interior, Defense, Information; trade
                                union movements; intellectual movements; etc.) with a view to taking
                                over the country without insurrection (i.e., Czechoslovakia) or to
                                support an insurrection if it should be called, (This form includes
                                fomenting local disturbances, strikes, etc.)</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>With respect to overt insurrection, the strong consensus of the Manila Pact
                        Working Group has been that the regularly constituted armed forces of the
                        nations are in the first instance the instrument which must be relied upon
                        to deal with open insurrection. To deal with it, such forces must be
                        effectively organized, trained, and equipped for this very important
                        mission. In most cases (the Philippines is an exception), this would
                        probably require a substantial change in their training doctrines and
                        possibly additional equipment to enable such forces to have a high degree of
                        mobility and <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0035"/>effectiveness (armored
                        cars, recoilless weapons, communications equipment, etc.). If National
                        forces are really well trained and well equipped to deal with insurrection,
                        they will exercise some deterrent against it, since if the Communists
                        believe that such national forces have the ability to crush insurrection in
                        the bud with consequent loss of Communist prestige, they will probably think
                        twice before launching an effort which would be abortive. If nonetheless the
                        Communists resort to insurrection, such armed forces would be primarily
                        relied upon to cope with it effectively.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the second type of subversion mentioned above, which involves
                        penetration, propaganda, and boring from within, the general consensus of
                        the Manila Pact countries (with the exception of the Philippines which
                        handles all these matters largely through the Army) is that this is best
                        dealt with by the police and special security services, which can be much
                        more effective in this mission if they are knowledgeable about modern police
                        techniques and have the necessary facilities, including communications
                        equipment. But, in the case of both regular armed forces and special service
                        forces, a high degree of training and technical proficiency will be
                        meaningless <hi rend="italic">unless the government in question has the will
                            and determination to use such forces effectively and in time</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Another aspect of the problem we face in most countries which are threatened
                        with subversion is the very limited resources which can be devoted to their
                        over-all security forces, both armed forces and police (including special
                        service units). I believe we would meet with strong resistance from any
                        country we might approach if we told them they should cut substantially
                        their armed forces and transfer the resources thus saved to form a
                        constabulary. Human nature plus prestige considerations in the numerical
                        strength of their armed forces, often in comparison with neighboring armed
                        forces, makes any government reluctant in the extreme to chop down
                        substantially its regular national military establishment to create a
                        constabulary or special police units. Although I have not sufficient
                        information to make a judgment, I am sure in my own mind that there are
                        countries that might usefully devote some of the resources which they now
                        spend on their armed forces to special service units to deal with subversion
                        (whether they be called constabulary or not) and yet such countries are
                        often the most reluctant for reasons of prestige to embark on such a policy.
                        If, on the other hand, the US deemed a supplementary constabulary-type force
                        necessary and were willing to underwrite the entire cost of the formation
                        and maintenance of such a body, many countries would probably be very happy
                        to go along. This, however, except possibly in exceptional cases, would,
                        because of the cost, probably be unacceptable to the <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4"
                            facs="0036"/>US in view of the very heavy nature of our existing
                        commitments to support armed forces.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the immediate problem, which is a study called for by the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, I believe that <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action 1290d is inappropriately phrased and
                        does not address itself to the problem, which should not be a report on
                        development of constabulary forces per se but rather a report on the
                        development of adequate security forces whatever they may be. That is,
                        regular armed forces, police, special service units, constabular-type
                        forces, or a combination thereof, to produce maximum internal security,
                        taking into account political, psychological, and economic considerations. I
                        do not see how this problem can be tackled on other than a
                        country-by-country basis, for the various internal considerations and
                        possibilities vary by country. Furthermore, the degree of urgency and
                        priority also varies. By this I mean that rather than try to develop
                        generalized conclusions for all countries, it would probably be most
                        profitable first to draw up a list of those countries which we feel are most
                        seriously threatened and where the need is greatest. Generally speaking,
                        this would probably relate to their proximity to the Communist orbit,
                        although in the case of Latin America, as the experience in Guatamala
                        proved, we cannot even generalize on this.</p>
                    <p>Before calling a meeting of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Working
                        Group, I believe we should have if possible a meeting of the four geographic

                        State draw up a priority list of countries which we think are seriously
                        threatened. I would then call a meeting of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"

                    <p>This may seem to be a slow process, but there is no way that I can see for an

                    <p>To formulate a concept for U.S. assistance in the development of forces
                        adequate to provide internal security in countries vulnerable to Communist
                        subversion.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Nature of Communist
                        Subversion</hi></p>
                    <p>1. Communist subversion takes forms which range from political penetration to
                        armed insurrection. Communist penetration is directed against every facet of
                        national life; government, labor unions, newspapers, educational
                        institutions and intellectual movements. Local strikes and disturbances are
                        fomented when they will further communist objectives. The principal
                        objective of communist penetration is to build the capability of seizing
                        control of a country without insurrection and at least to reduce the
                        capacity of the local governments to oppose insurrection if the communists
                        resort to it.</p>
                    <p>2. Armed insurrection ranges from small-scale guerrilla activity to
                        large-scale national rebellion. The communist tactics vary from country to
                        country. They may attempt to weaken the political and economic system in
                        order to discredit the local government and force <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6"
                            facs="0038"/>it to accept communist participation; or they may attempt
                        to seize control by armed force.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Requirements of Internal
                        Security</hi></p>
                    <p>3. The general political and economic well-being of the country concerned is
                        an important factor contributing to success in controlling communist
                        subversion. In particular, the success of preventive measures depends upon
                        development of that type of public opinion which will lead the local
                        citizenry to identify itself with the local government and the security
                        forces in dealing with subversion, and which will assist in inducing
                        defections from the Communist side.</p>
                    <p>4. In the internal security field the prevention and control of communist
                        subversion requires for the most part preventive, police-type activity
                        including the application of limited force. Such activity includes: <list>
                            <label>a.</label>
                            <item>The detection of communist agents, fellow-travellers, front
                                organizations and other components of the communist
                                apparatus.</item>
                            <label>b.</label>
                            <item>The detention of communist personalities or groups.</item>
                            <label>c.</label>
                            <item>The execution of judicial measures against these persons or
                                groups.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>5. In countries where communist subversion has reached a stage of actual or
                        potential insurrection its control and reduction normally involves the use
                        of greater force than is at the disposition of the normal preventive
                        police-type services. Military-type action is therefore required in certain
                        instances to supplement police-type action.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Internal Security Forces</hi></p>
                    <p>6. The functions of detection, arrest and judicial action are normally vested
                        in the civil arm of government—police, investigative services, and the
                        courts. It is the function of these forces to discover and destroy the
                        communist subversive apparatus before it is able to achieve important
                        penetration. In countries where the control of subversion requires limited
                        application of force, police-type forces are usually organized to include
                        armed police, gendarmérie or constabulary. Such forces are generally under
                        the direction of a civilian branch of the government and are distinct from
                        the regular national armed forces.</p>
                    <p>7. Where police-type operations, including limited applications of force, are
                        not adequate to cope with communist subversion the regular military forces
                        must take action. The suppression of organized insurrection requires in
                        addition to police-type action military-type action which can be effectively
                        conducted only by regular military forces.</p>

                    <p>10. <hi rend="italic">General Considerations</hi>. The U.S. has a vital
                        interest in assisting free world countries to defend themselves against
                        communist subversion. Since for most of these countries the U.S. is an
                        important potential source of external assistance, it is in the U.S.
                        interest that the internal security forces of these countries be able to
                        deal with all forms of subversive penetration and insurrection both
                        effectively and economically. In general it will be neither efficient nor
                        economical for the U.S., initially at least, to press for sweeping changes
                        in the general structure of the internal security forces of these countries.
                        U.S. efforts, therefore, should be directed primarily toward improving the
                        over-all effectiveness of existing forces.</p>

                    <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Military-type forces</hi>. In those countries where
                        communist subversion has reached the stage of actual or potential
                        large-scale insurrection U.S. assistance should include, in addition to the
                        measures outlined in paragraph 11, primary emphasis upon coping with the
                        threat of armed insurrection. In most of these countries the U.S. does not
                        expect that in cases of external armed aggression the regular military
                        forces alone can deal with large scale attacks. The regular military forces
                        could perform little more than a covering or delaying role. In some of these
                        countries, moreover, the U.S. would not expect to use its own armed forces
                        locally in case of external aggression but would plan to counter such
                        aggression with military operations directed against the aggressor
                        elsewhere. The U.S. should therefore be prepared where necessary to see some
                        sacrifice of the capability of the local regular military forces to meet
                        external armed aggression in order to achieve the required capability to
                        deal with internal insurrection. For political and morale reasons these
                        forces must have a dual mission: (a) protecting the frontiers of the country
                        against external attack, and (b) suppressing internal insurrection. The
                        latter mission, however, should in practice be conceived by the U.S. as
                        primary and in these countries the U.S. should direct its military
                        assistance towards providing that type of training, equipment and deployment
                        of the regular military forces which will best fit them for dealing with
                        insurrection. The U.S. could then better deal with pressure for the
                        provision of that type of modern heavy military equipment which is useful
                        only for meeting overt aggression by encouraging local governments to
                        conceive of their regular forces as primarily an instrument for dealing with
                        subversion. To the degree that the local leaders can be brought to recognize
                        and accept the importance of this mission, U.S. assistance can be more
                        effectively utilized, and pressure on the U.S. for assistance in unrealistic
                        types of equipment and organization would be relaxed.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation</hi></p>
                    <p>13. The U.S. should adopt the following general concept for U.S. assistance
                        in development of foreign forces for internal security: <list>
                            <label>a.</label>
                            <item>It is in the U.S. national interest to assist free world countries
                                to defend themselves against communist subversion. In general the
                                U.S. should seek more effective use of forces and agencies in being
                                rather than the creation of new types of security forces. Where
                                communist subversion is in a relatively early stage of development
                                and consists primarily of efforts at penetration, U.S. assistance
                                for internal security should be directed primarily toward the
                                development of effective preventive forces—police, investigative
                                services, <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0041"/>and judicial
                                systems—and the development of public support for these forces. In
                                countries where communist subversion has matured to the stage of
                                actual or potential insurrection the U.S. should, in addition,
                                direct its military assistance primarily toward developing the
                                capability of the military forces of the country to take military
                                action against insurrection. In doing so the U.S. should encourage
                                the acceptance of action against internal insurrection as one of the
                                primary missions of the regular military forces of the local
                                country. The U.S. should recognize that the assignment of this
                                mission will reduce their capability to conduct large scale military
                                operations.</item>

                    <p>But the votes on a number of issues were rather close in the Committee, and
                        there will be difficulty on the floor. Strong Democratic support can be
                        counted, and I have personally checked with Speaker <persName

                            corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName>. Thus, the key question is whether
                        the Republicans in the House will be mobilized in sufficient numbers to
                        uphold the Committee and to uphold the President’s recommendations.</p>
                    <p>It is anticipated that the most difficult issues on the floor will be these: <list>

                                            and sovereign, and this is very much more in the United

                                        <item>The United States has scored a real success in Western
                                            Europe. It took seven or eight years to do it, but it is
                                            now evident to all. The Communists are now concentrating
                                            on the Asian nations. We are beginning to show success
                                            in this area. It is extremely important in the United
                                            States national interests that we follow through to a
                                            successful program that gives Japan and India and other
                                            Asian nations a chance to earn a living, to remain
                                            non-Communist, and to establish reasonable defense
                                            capabilities.</item>

                                            and opportunities for private investment, we will work

                        between our Mutual Security Program, recent developments in Russia, and the
                        Geneva Conference of the Big Four<note n="2" xml:id="d5fn2">The Geneva
                            Summit Conference, held July 18–23, brought together President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName> of the United Kingdom,
                            Premier Edgar Faure of France, and Premier Nikolai Bulganin of the
                            Soviet Union. For documentation, see <ref target="frus1955-57v05#pg_119"

                    <p>He believed the Soviet leaders were anxious to get some relief from the
                        strains that beset them. Trying to keep up with our pace was one such
                        strain, he said, for they can only hope to do so in the short run, not over
                        a long term. We have, he continued, shown thus far in this Administration
                        our determination to pursue a steady policy, at a level of preparedness much
                        higher than when we came <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0046"/>in. The
                        Russians, on the other hand, are now experiencing political weakness—in the
                        absence of a dictator—hence their anxiety to obtain some relief. As a
                        result, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> thought, we should
                        obtain something very worthwhile from our discussions either in terms of
                        Germany, or the satellite states, or some cessation of their international
                        subversive effort—the Cominform.</p>
                    <p>At this immediate time, he asserted, we should maintain the pressure rather
                        than show any signs of softening, hence we ought to get this Mutual Security
                        Program through. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed
                        out how much of the program would be devoted to loans—necessarily soft
                        ones.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_Sen1">Sen.</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KW1">Knowland</persName> and Rep. <persName
                            corresp="#p_VJM1">Vorys</persName> both stressed the desirability of
                        having a Congressional stipulation as to a required percentage of loans,
                        otherwise the funds might be overweighted on the grants side. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> felt that a stipulation acted more
                        as a limit rather than a requirement, for the foreign countries expected all
                        to be grants after the Congressional requirement should be met. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> pointed out that we are
                        making more loans rather than grants to the Coal and Steel Community than
                        Congress had stipulated.</p>
                    <p>Turning to Yugoslavia, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        stressed that it was the best leverage we had for getting an increased
                        independence of the satellites. Russia seemed to have eaten humble pie at
                        Belgrade, he said, and we should not risk any action that would tend to
                        drive the Yugoslavs back to their Russian connections.</p>
                    <p>As regards India, he thought that if that vast population should lean towards
                        Communism, there would be a great and serious impact on all of Asia. We are
                        not awarding gifts for policies we dislike, he explained, we are simply
                        trying to prevent India from moving towards Communism.</p>
                    <p>As regards the Geneva meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> said we are going there with a feeling that we may be
                        able to set up processes that may lead to improving the security of the free
                        world and the United States. There is some basis for hope that the Soviet
                        frontiers can go back in such a way as to leave independent “cushion” states
                        between Russia and free Europe.</p>
                    <p>Questioned by <gloss target="#t_Sen1">Sen.</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Saltonstall</persName> about <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>’s attitude at San Francisco, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> professed ignorance of
                        international activities. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        added that he did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> expect Russia to admit that
                        these questions could be open to discussion, but he thought that they might
                        in fact take some steps that we would see as desirable.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_Sen1">Sen.</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KW1">Knowland</persName> agreed that neither
                        Yugoslavia nor India should be cut out of the program, but he felt it
                        important to carry through the equipment inspection regularly required. He
                        said that if we let Yugoslavia get away with this denial of what we should
                        be able to <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0047"/>do, it would be
                        discriminatory against our allies. Also, as regards India, it would be bad
                        if the impression got established around the world that we reward
                        neutralism. <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> agreed that we should continue to press Tito for some
                        arrangement on this, and we are currently negotiating with him about it;
                        indeed, it helps our negotiators to have Congress take this position. As for
                        India, we give much more assistance to the other nations who are willing to
                        stand up and be counted.</p>
                    <p>Rep. <persName corresp="#p_VJM1">Vorys</persName> asked about the communiqué
                        issued after the Belgrade visit of the Russians—was it as satisfying as it
                        appeared to be? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that
                        was uncertain.</p>

                        <p>Defense-supporting economic assistance is being furnished or is
                            contemplated to carefully selected and strategically located free world
                            countries in a wide arc which virtually surrounds the Soviet Bloc. These
                            countries are united with the US in a common cause: to resist Communist
                            penetration or domination of the free world. US assistance is designed
                            to render their joint defensive strength more effective, and to help
                            them achieve the economic strength which will, in the long run, enable
                            them to maintain without further aid the forces which the US believes to
                            be required.</p>
                        <p>Each of these countries faces three main demands upon its resources:
                            defense, current consumption, and investment—the latter to provide a
                            growing base for increasing productive capacity to meet the future needs
                            of defense, consumption needs of expanding population, and tangible
                            increase in living standards. Few free world countries—outside of Europe
                            and North America—possess indigenous resources in sufficient volume to
                            maintain a tolerable standard of living for their people and at the same
                            time commit the human and capital resources necessary for adequate
                            defense and investment. They are, in many cases, virtually forced to
                            devote top priority to consumption and investment. US security interests
                            dictate that they make adequate provision for these needs, not only to
                            sustain the necessary will, strength, and stability to face the Soviet
                            threat and to provide constructive and attractive alternatives to
                            Communism, but also, through economic development generally, to reduce
                            the need for future US assistance. Meantime, US assistance provides the
                            marginal resources required to bridge the gap between those military
                            forces which could be maintained by them without aid and those which the
                            countries and the US agree to be necessary, without impairing economic
                            development.</p>

                                    security, or police forces, direct support which is additional
                                    to the regular military assistance (<gloss target="#t_MDAP1"

                                    />goods (i.e., items other than military hardware) which are
                                    essential to the maintenance of a military force. Such items are
                                    delivered or rendered directly to friendly forces for their

                                    purpose of this program is military; any economic benefits which
                                    may accrue to the country are incidental.</item>

                                <item><hi rend="italic">Defense Support</hi>. Programs within this
                                    classification are designed to support the military efforts of
                                    certain countries which receive <gloss target="#t_MDAP1"
                                        >MDAP</gloss> assistance. Such support involves the
                                    provision of general supplemental resources which a recipient
                                    country requires if its economy is to support a defense program
                                    of the size which US policy regards as essential and if, at the
                                    same time, it is to maintain or attain the minimum level of
                                    economic strength or growth which is consistent with the US
                                    national interest. The primary policy reason for defense support
                                    programs is the attainment of military objectives, rather than
                                    the extension of any economic benefits which may also accrue to
                                    the recipient nation. However, where a defense support program
                                    is required in a country for this policy reason, other
                                    non-military assistance which is essential from the standpoint
                                    of US national interest may also be grouped under the heading of
                                    “defense support”. This practice avoids an unrealistic
                                    fragmentation into several artificial components of a totally
                                    integrated assistance program.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Direct forces support differs from defense support in that the former
                            consists of articles or services which can be traced in a physical sense
                            from a point of import into the country directly to the soldier who uses
                            it; the latter has its military impact as a country’s economy is
                            rendered capable of sustaining the desired enlargement of its defense
                            burden.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that the definition of direct forces support is
                            somewhat more restricted than that which held in the past. It excludes
                            any supplies which are to be sold within a country to finance the local
                            currency costs of military projects (as, for example, military
                            construction) for which the direct forces support program is furnishing
                            imported goods. Program figures for defense support and direct forces
                            support for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 and prior years, as
                            set forth in the several country tables, have been adjusted to show
                            those portions of the program which would be included under the new
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 functional definitions.</p>
                        <p>It should also be noted that direct forces support for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 will no longer be administered by
                                <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>. Since the dividing line between
                                <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> and direct forces support is
                            imprecise, they have been considered as two phases of the military
                            program, and will be administered by the Department of Defense. For
                            reporting convenience, <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0051"/>however,
                            both direct forces support and defense support programs are covered in
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> report through June 30,
                            1955.</p>
                        <p>Parenthetically, as a direct result of this transfer, complications have
                            arisen in the administration of military support programs. These
                            complications stem from the close relationship between defense support
                            and direct forces support programs. In many instances, a defense support
                            program, administered by <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, actually
                            provides the local currency component for a direct forces support
                            project, the dollars for which have been appropriated to the Department
                            of Defense. The problem is further complicated by the fact that there
                            are competing needs for this local currency. While <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and the Department of Defense are
                            endeavoring to resolve these problems, it would appear to be appropriate
                            to review the decision to transfer to the Department of Defense the
                            responsibility for administration of dollars in the direct forces
                            support program.</p>

                        <p>The trend indicated by the foregoing figures has been evident for a
                            number of years: a progressive decline in assistance—and in the
                            proportion of such assistance—to Europe, while the proportion of funds
                            for the Near and Far East has risen. This reflects a considerable
                            measure of success in meeting both military and economic targets in
                            Europe; of the Western European countries, only Spain and Yugoslavia are
                            scheduled to receive defense support or direct forces support in 1956.
                            On the other hand, the US has shown an increasing measure of concern
                            with the weakness of the free world’s military position in the Near and
                            Far East.</p>

                                        and Formosa; Cambodia signed a military defense agreement

                            this status report. The purpose of these non-defense-related programs is
                            to advance the economic development of underdeveloped areas in the
                            interests of US national security, to promote local incentives and
                            catalyze self-help. They are also used on occasion to cope with special
                            problems such as financial and budgetary crises not directly related to

                                    <p>Technical cooperation programs may be defined as programs for
                                        the sharing of our knowledge, experience, techniques and
                                        skills with the peoples of the less developed areas of the
                                        world for the purpose of helping them to further their
                                        economic development and increase their standard of living.
                                        These programs emphasize, and consist largely of advice,
                                        teaching, training and the exchange of information, and they
                                        do not include the provision of supplies and equipment
                                        beyond that which is required for effective teaching and
                                        demonstration purposes. Moreover, except for these last
                                        mentioned purposes, they do not supply the capital which may

                                    <p>This term describes assistance given primarily to promote
                                        economic development or otherwise to create or maintain
                                        economic or political stability. In most nations for which
                                        it is programmed, development assistance will supplement
                                        programs of technical cooperation by providing supplies,
                                        commodities or funds. Usually this type of assistance is
                                        required to make possible, or to accelerate, projects or
                                        activities which basic US interest requires to be undertaken
                                        and which, in the absence of such additional assistance,
                                        would not be undertaken, or, if undertaken, would not be
                                        carried out at the rate required by US foreign policy.

                                        by local and foreign private capital or from financing from

                        <p>Development assistance differs from defense support in that the former is
                            immediately directed toward goals which are not primarily military in
                            character, whereas the latter has as its first aim, and controlling
                            justification, the attainment of military objectives. With minor
                            exceptions (e.g., Latin America) development assistance is limited to
                            countries which do not receive military assistance.</p>
                        <p>Areas receiving assistance under development assistance and technical
                            cooperation programs include Israel and the Arab States in the Near
                            East; Liberia, Libya, Ethiopia in Africa; India, Nepal and Afghanistan
                            in South Asia; Indonesia in the Far East; the Latin American republics
                            (except Argentina); and the overseas territories of European powers in
                            Africa and the Western Hemisphere. While Ethiopia, Iraq and certain
                            Latin American countries do in fact receive military assistance, the
                            economic aid programs (principally technical cooperation) are addressed
                            wholly to economic development and social progress rather than to
                            support of the defense effort. Technical <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25"
                                facs="0057"/>cooperation programs, however, are in effect in a

                    <p>The Operations Coordinating Board has established an interagency committee,
                        with you as Chairman, to examine our military and economic aid programs and
                        to make appropriate recommendations. This committee was established at the
                        instigation of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>. The other
                        members are Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gordon Gray</persName>, Assistant
                        Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs; Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_OJH1">Ohly</persName>, Deputy Director for Programs of the
                        International Cooperation Administration; and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_OAN1">Overby</persName>, Assistant Secretary of the
                        Treasury. It is expected that the Budget Bureau will be represented in an
                        observer capacity, and the Central Intelligence Agency in an advisory
                        capacity.</p>
                    <p>The exact terms of reference for this committee have not yet been finally
                        approved by the Operations Coordinating Board. Final approval has been
                        delayed until your return. The latest draft of the terms of reference is
                            attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d7fn2">Not printed. The final terms of

                    <p>The problem of properly coordinating our military and economic aid program
                        has been recognized for some time. Various attempts have been made to deal
                        with the problem but with limited success. We find that frequently
                        commitments on military programs are made with inadequate study of the
                        impact on the economy of the country concerned and in turn on its
                        implications for United States economic assistance. In recent months,
                        problems have arisen in connection with the Turkish and Pakistan programs,
                        requiring substantial additional amounts of U.S. economic assistance in
                        order to attain our military and economic objectives in those countries. It
                        is likely that similar problems for a number of other countries are just
                        over the horizon, if not closer. We believe that the emergence of these
                        serious situations and the possibility of more to come is the basic reason
                        for taking a new look with an <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>
                        committee.</p>
                    <p>As you can well imagine, the job is not a small one. In fact, it is a very
                        large and difficult one. The factors to be considered include as precise a
                        statement as possible of our military and economic objectives in a given
                        country, the ability and willingness of the country to support programs
                        consistent with these objectives, the translation of the above factors into
                        the amount of military and economic aid required, the length of time this
                        must be continued, and finally, the problem of whether the United States is
                        prepared to finance the amounts required or whether some change in
                        objectives is preferable.</p>
                    <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0059"/>
                    <p>The problem can be narrowed to some degree, because it is most acute in the
                        economically underdeveloped countries where we are encouraging rather
                        substantial defense efforts. At least initially, it is felt that the Latin
                        American countries can be set aside, inasmuch as we do not have very large
                        military or economic programs in that area. Likewise, in the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries of Western Europe, there is no
                        longer any economic aid, the countries have become increasingly strong
                        economically, and the military program is pretty well stabilized. It is in
                        the following countries that the problem is most acute: <table rows="3"

                    <p>Perhaps the best way for the committee to proceed would be to establish
                        inter-agency working groups for each country which the committee feels
                        should be examined. It is suggested that each working group should have as
                        its chairman a representative of the appropriate regional bureau of the
                        State Department and as members a representative from the <gloss
                            target="#t_E1">E</gloss> area, a representative from Defense, <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and Treasury. Other agencies might attend
                        when they could be helpful. These working groups would then develop facts,
                        make analyses and reach conclusions. Your committee, in turn, would consider
                        the situation in each case and make appropriate recommendations to the
                        Operations Coordinating Board.</p>
                    <p>An inter-agency working group already exists for Pakistan and has recently
                        made a report, which has been referred to your committee. It would seem that
                        after the general procedural questions are out of the way, this Pakistan
                        report would become the first item of substantive business for your
                        committee. We are now examining this report with the purpose of determining
                        whether the pertinent facts and issues are presented in such a way that your
                        committee could take effective action. Our preliminary view is that it needs
                        to be more explicit concerning our military objectives and commitments.
                        Inasmuch as this is perhaps the principal basic jumping off place for
                        further consideration and analysis, this would seem to be a fatal weakness.
                        However, we would like to make a more considered and detailed report on this
                        in the near future. An inter-agency working group is also in existence for
                        Turkey. It had a somewhat different objective, and although it also made a
                        report several months ago, it was made on the premise that the military
                        program was a fixed quantity and not to be questioned. Therefore, it is
                        likely that this report will need to be reconsidered before being submitted
                        to your committee.</p>
                    <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0060"/>
                    <p>As soon as the Operations Coordinating Board makes the final determination on
                        the terms of reference for your committee, you will probably want to call a
                        meeting to discuss methods of proceeding and perhaps also to consider the
                        report of the working group on Pakistan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1"
                            >Waugh</persName> earlier called a meeting of the committee, but at that
                        time the representatives of the other agencies were not familiar with the
                        action of the Operations Coordinating Board in setting up the committee, so
                        that no formal inter-agency work under the auspices of the committee has
                        been started.</p>

                            Affecting U.S. Security</hi></p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of unrelated subjects.]</p>
                    <p>With respect to his next subject, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">[Allen]
                            Dulles</persName> said that the Central Intelligence Agency had been
                        piecing together and collating all available information from all available
                        sources on moves by the Soviet Bloc to move in on the underdeveloped areas
                        of the free world, notably in the Near East and Southeast Asia. When all
                        these Soviet Bloc moves were listed, they indicated a pattern of coordinated
                        long-term and high-level operations designed to advance Communist influence
                        in all these areas. Thereafter Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                            >Dulles</persName> listed actual measures of assistance or offers of
                        assistance made by the Soviet Bloc to the following countries: India,
                        Afghanistan, Indonesia, Turkey, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and Burma.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>’
                        report, the Vice President inquired as to the specific nature of the acts or
                        promises of assistance to these countries offered by the Soviet Union. Did
                        they consist of loans or gifts? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                            >Dulles</persName> replied that mostly they consisted of loans at low
                        interest in return for local currencies or local exports. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that the United
                        States seemed to have no equivalent to match these Soviet techniques. U.S.
                        assistance <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0061"/>either took the form of
                        outright gifts or else constituted loans in return for hard currencies. The
                        Vice President expressed considerable concern over this point.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RHC1"
                            >Rose</persName>, asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                            >Dulles</persName> if he had any notion of the over-all magnitude of
                        this Soviet Bloc effort in terms of dollars. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                            >Dulles</persName> replied that of course you could add up all the
                        individual items which he had listed for all the individual countries; but
                        the matter was complicated by the fact that many of these assistance
                        programs were still in the offer stage. On the other hand, even Soviet Bloc
                        offers of assistance had a very considerable impact on the position of the
                        United States in these underdeveloped areas of the world.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President stated that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                            >Dulles</persName>’ report indicated to him that the Administration must
                        give very serious thought to the question whether or not it held adequate
                        cards to play against the Soviet Bloc. The United States might presently be
                        faced with some very painful alternatives if it was effectively to meet the
                        situation to which the Soviet aid program had given rise. The Vice President
                        asked if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> shared this
                        opinion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> replied that the situation
                        was one which certainly deserved most careful study. Obviously the United
                        States had the capability to match or outstrip any Soviet program. He
                        pointed out that all these underdeveloped countries were very deeply
                        impressed with what the Soviet Union had been able to accomplish, from an
                        industrial and economic point of view, in the course of the last fifteen or
                        twenty years. This seemed more impressive than the accomplishments of the
                        United States, which had had such a long history of industrial development
                        and which was essentially so rich. Comparison of the U.S. and the USSR
                        assistance had convinced many officials of the underdeveloped countries
                        that, for their countries at least, the Soviet system might have more to
                        offer in the way of quick results than the U.S. system.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that
                        programs of economic assistance to underdeveloped countries posed a very
                        difficult problem for the United States. If we went in and spent our money
                        building industrial plants and other installations for some backward
                        country, who was going to have title and ownership over these plants which
                        had been built with U.S. funds? If the ultimate owner was the state, we
                        would be helping these countries to proceed down the road which led to state
                        socialism or to Communism. Was it not possible, therefore, to see that
                        ownership of some of the plants and installations built by U.S. assistance
                        programs ultimately got into the hands of some small native capitalists? If
                        this could be done we might counter the evident socialist trend in many of
                        these areas.</p>
                    <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0062"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> answered Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> by saying that there could
                        be very little doubt that the state would end up owning most of the plants
                        and facilities constructed in an underdeveloped country as a result of U.S.
                        assistance programs.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission expressed great sympathy for
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s point of view, and
                        said that the problem he had raised also affected the <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> very directly. The <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                            >AEC</gloss> was on the verge of constructing small power reactors for
                        various countries overseas. In so far as we continued to deal on a
                        government-to-government basis with respect to such programs, we were in
                        effect simply encouraging TVA projects in the countries for which we
                        provided power reactors. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SALL1"
                            >Strauss</persName> said that he would appreciate an expression of the
                        Council’s views on the wisdom of this course of action before he went ahead
                        with carrying out programs for constructing power reactors to be sent
                        abroad.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President then suggested that this was perhaps a good point at which
                        to terminate discussion of the report which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                            >Dulles</persName> had made, but he hoped that the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2"
                            >The principal policy formulating body of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> whose voting membership consisted of the Special

                            representatives from the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization, the
                            Bureau of the Budget, and the Departments of State, Defense, and the
                            Treasury.</note> would take account of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                            >Dulles</persName>’ report and come up to the National Security Council
                        with a suggested U.S. program to counter the program of the Soviet Bloc so
                        carefully outlined by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> indicated that at
                        two forthcoming meetings of the National Security Council an opportunity
                        would be presented to the Planning Board to carry out The Vice President’s
                        suggestion. The problem would certainly come up in the forthcoming Council
                        review of the military assistance programs world-wide. A second opportunity
                        would be presented to the Planning Board to make recommendations when the
                        Planning Board produced for Council consideration its revision of the basic
                        national security policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501).</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that it was none
                        too soon to start right now to develop hard information which would indicate
                        to the countries who would receive Soviet aid that in point of fact
                        receiving this aid constituted the first step which ultimately led to a
                        Communist take-over. The Soviet Bloc program which he had described was not
                        genuine economic assistance to underdeveloped countries, but political
                        penetration in disguise. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> added that the Soviet program actually constituted a
                        new form of colonialism.</p>
                    <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0063"/>
                    <p>The Vice President suggested that the essentials of Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>’ report might usefully be given to
                        the President at the earliest opportunity. To The Vice President, at least,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>’ report had been “an
                        eye-opener”.</p>
                    <p>The Acting Secretary of State expressed the opinion that the total cost of
                        the Soviet Bloc assistance program wouldn’t amount to very much in
                        comparison with comparable U.S. programs. If you dealt in terms of what was
                        actually being done, as opposed to offers which were dangled before the
                        underdeveloped countries, the program was quite small. Accordingly,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> suggested the
                        advisability of putting a price tag on each of the items which made up the
                        Soviet Bloc program of assistance to the underdeveloped countries. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> suggested that the
                        picture would not be complete without the addition of the recent Soviet Bloc
                        arms deal, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                        wished to have incorporated in the revised report some reference to the
                        problem of the ultimate ownership of factories and installations provided to
                        the underdeveloped countries through U.S. economic assistance programs.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> endorsed Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s suggestion, and added
                        his own opinion that in many instances our assistance programs were actually
                        subsidizing state socialism in the underdeveloped areas.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> raised the question
                        of the desirability of having a study as to why the Soviet Union seemed to
                        gain so much influence with so small an outlay of resources, as compared to
                        the United States. For example, we have been assisting India to overcome its
                        economic problems for a number of years and with quite considerable funds,
                        and yet we received absolutely no credit in India for the assistance which
                        we had been rendering.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President wondered whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"
                            >Hollister</persName> might not have something to say on this problem
                        after he returned from his trip to the Far East.</p>

                    <p>The Director of Central Intelligence referred briefly to growing Communist
                        pressures on Berlin, and to the likelihood that new French elections would
                        now be postponed from December to some time between January and March,
                        1956.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> then referred to the
                        question asked by The Vice President at the previous meeting of the National
                        Security Council, as to why, with much smaller resources than were made
                        available by the U.S., the Soviet programs for assistance to underdeveloped
                        countries seemed to make a more substantial impact on the governments and
                        peoples of these countries than the larger U.S. programs. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> asked the President’s permission to
                        read his answer to The Vice President’s question. He singled out the issue
                        of the former colonial status of many of the underdeveloped countries as
                        providing part of the explanation. Another part was the inferiority complex
                        which many of these countries displayed in their dealings with the United
                        States. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> then pointed out
                        that the Communists were very astute in their approach to the governments of
                        these backward states. They were careful to refrain from the use of such
                        adjectives as “backward” and “underdeveloped”. Moreover, they had more
                        flexibility than the U.S. in their approach. They were not required to ask
                        for a quid pro quo in return for their assistance. Nor were they hampered by
                        legislation such as our Battle Act.<note n="2" xml:id="d9fn2">Reference is
                            to the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951 (Public Law 213),
                            sponsored by Congressman Laurie C. Battle of Alabama and enacted October
                            26, 1951. It provided for the suspension of U.S. economic aid to nations
                            supplying strategic materials to Communist nations. For text, see 65
                            Stat. 644.</note> They were willing to accept almost any kind of
                        repayment, including repayment in soft currencies, which they then used to
                        develop their subversive program in the country in question.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> also pointed out that large
                        elements in the new world-wide Soviet program of assistance to
                        underdeveloped countries consisted at this time of promises rather than of
                        actual deliveries. Beyond this, in explanation of the Soviet success, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said that the Soviet
                        program took account of the special <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0065"
                        />circumstances which existed in a particular underdeveloped country. The
                        pattern of trade also played a role; for example, the Soviets appeared happy
                        to help Burma dispose of its consistent rice surpluses. Finally, and perhaps
                        most important, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> restated
                        the thesis that many of these underdeveloped countries had been enormously
                        impressed by what the Soviet Union had accomplished, virtually unaided, in
                        developing its industrialization over a very brief period of time. Since
                        this success was largely attributed to the Communist system, the governments
                        of many underdeveloped countries drew the deduction that a Communist system
                        would likewise prove most efficient in accomplishing their own
                        industrialization. It was also plain that many of these countries believed
                        that they could play off Soviet and U.S. assistance against one another.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> concluded his remarks on
                        this subject by pointing out how difficult it was to impress on the states
                        in question the dangers of Soviet penetration through the agency of alleged
                        assistance programs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> concluded his intelligence
                        briefing with remarks on the difficult situations confronting the
                        governments of the ABC powers in Latin America.</p>

                    <p>[Here follows <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>’ report on the
                        Geneva Conference, Germany and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, the
                        Baghdad Pact meeting, and his visits to Spain, Italy, and Yugoslavia.]</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he had a
                        certain number of things to talk about, but he was not sure that this was
                        the time to bring them up. Important budgetary decisions would have to be
                        made in the next three weeks.</p>
                    <p>The President, in response to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName>’s statement, said that it would be well to bear in
                        mind the old adage, “Be not the first by which the new is tried, nor yet the
                        last to put the old aside.” While, said the President, he could see a lot in
                        what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> and Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> had said to him the last
                        time they saw <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0066"/>him in the hospital at
                        Denver, he was still convinced that the Administration had the means at hand
                        to make budgetary cuts in the Defense Department if we actually had the
                        courage to go ahead and make these cuts. For example, continued the
                        President, do we really need to have as much air and sea lift as we think we
                        need to have in order to transport our forces rapidly to various trouble
                        spots?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then said that what
                        troubled him with respect to our national security policy, was the fact that
                        we had taken on such a “lot of losers” as allies and clients—for example,
                        Korea, Formosa, and Indochina. The Near East, in Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s opinion, was on the contrary an
                        area of real value to the United States which some day might become
                        self-supporting.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> alluded to the fact
                        that in a very few days the over-all ceiling figures for the foreign aid
                        item in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 budget must be
                        determined. Would the President care to make any comments on the general
                        level of our foreign assistance programs for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1957?</p>
                    <p>The President replied that he had one idea at least on this subject. When Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> had finally figured out
                        what he thought he really needed, he ought to ask for $500 million extra.
                        Our foreign assistance programs were, in the President’s opinion, “the
                        cheapest insurance in the world”. The want of a few million bucks had put
                        the United States into a war in Korea. Accordingly, the President counselled
                        that we keep a fund handy and available into which we could move rapidly if
                        an emergency need arose. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"
                            >Hollister</persName> commented that he had been trying to achieve the
                        President’s objective by setting aside reserve funds in the present
                        operations of his agency, and that he had been much criticized for so
                        doing.</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> commented that the
                        Administration might possibly get by with a much smaller budget for foreign
                        aid if we could somehow achieve greater flexibility in the implementation of
                        our foreign aid program.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> observed that it was
                        the view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that a figure of $2.7 billion was
                        going to be needed in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 if we were to
                        maintain our military assistance program at approximately present levels.
                        Indeed, it was the view of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName> that this was insufficient, and that we ought to go
                        up to a figure of $3.4 billion. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> said that he himself was inclined to feel that a
                        figure of $3 billion might perhaps be the best.</p>
                    <p>The President then called for last year’s over-all figures, and when these
                        had been supplied said that when the new figures were finally available they
                        should be laid out on the table for discussion. Meanwhile he was extremely
                        anxious to use up the backlog of funds available for foreign aid. It was
                        such a big backlog.</p>
                    <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0067"/>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of planned defense expenditures and the question of
                        balancing the Federal budget.]</p>
                    <p>The Vice President then referred to the point earlier mentioned as to the
                        need for flexibility in the execution of our foreign aid programs. He
                        likewise pointed out the apparent flexibility of the similar Soviet
                        programs, which had considerable impact although there was comparatively
                        little money involved. Was there not, inquired The Vice President, a real
                        possibility that as the Soviet program moved ahead the United States would
                        be obliged to think in terms of a much larger foreign assistance program?
                        While the concept of the balanced budget was fine, The Vice President
                        wondered whether in actuality the State Department would not feel compelled
                        to ask for larger expenditures in the field of foreign assistance.</p>
                    <p>In response, the President commented that gaining our objectives in this area
                        was not always a matter of money. See what the Soviets had done with their
                        shipment of arms to Egypt. While the President said he was ready to do
                        anything sensible, he actually believed that we never emphasized
                        sufficiently the contribution of our information service (<gloss
                            target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>). The President believed that we could
                        use a little more money for this activity much more effectively than we
                        could use a lot more money on our foreign aid programs. And, asked the
                        President, how about loans instead of grant aid? Amidst laughter, The Vice
                        President pointed out that many of these loans hurt Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> just as much as grants.</p>
                    <p>At this point, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> raised
                        again the problem that he had outlined at the previous meeting of the
                        National Security Council—namely, the socializing process which we build up
                        in foreign countries as a result of conferring our aid on the governments of
                        the countries which were its recipients. Agreeing heartily with Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said that the Russians had not done
                        10% as much socializing in the world as the United States. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> added that this was, in
                        his opinion, a very serious problem, and that our assistance conferred on
                        governments rather than on individuals in foreign countries might ultimately
                        prove to be self-defeating.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> broke in on this
                        phase of the discussion to say that he believed that there was merit in the
                        point that The Vice President had made with respect to the likelihood of a
                        need to increase the size of our foreign aid programs. The scene of the
                        battle between the free world and the Communist world was shifting. The
                        United States and the free world must be prepared henceforth to meet much
                        more serious Soviet economic competition. On the other hand, we cannot let
                        ourselves be placed in a position where we can be “busted” by being obliged
                        to meet and cap every Soviet offer of <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0068"
                        />assistance all over the world. Being obliged to equal or exceed each
                        Soviet popularity bid would be hopeless for the United States.</p>
                    <p>The President, referring to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName>’s concern over the socializing role of U.S. aid and
                        assistance to foreign countries, said he felt compelled to point out that
                        the fact that certain countries-such as Denmark, Norway and Sweden—were far
                        more socialized than the U.S. (and, said the President, smiling, there’s a
                        degree of socialization here also), did not mean that these countries were
                        inimical to the United States. They were, indeed, among our best friends.
                        Continuing, the President said the fact of the matter was that every foreign
                        country could develop a government which, while more socialized than we
                        might like, nevertheless succeeded in avoiding dictatorship and totalitarian
                        methods. This was not necessarily a drawback from the U.S. point of view.
                        Accordingly, the President indicated that he was not inclined to think that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s point was of
                        critical importance to our policies at this time.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said that what we
                        ought to try to do was to stimulate private industry in those countries
                        which were recipients of U.S. military and economic assistance. Admittedly,
                        however, this was a very difficult course of action. At this point, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> reminded the Council that
                        the whole subject of United States military assistance world-wide was
                        scheduled for consideration by the National Security Council at the meeting
                        to be held on December 8. The Vice President observed that when this subject
                        was reported on to the National Security Council, he hoped that those making
                        the presentation, and especially Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"
                            >Hollister</persName>, could provide some idea of the balance between
                        what the Soviets are doing in the field of foreign assistance compared to
                        what the United States is doing. Such comparisons, directed to certain key
                        countries, would be much more useful than the usual rundown on the status of

                            <item>The rendering of military aid, based on a decision to build
                                indigenous forces in a given country, generates in most cases
                                further requirements in the form of Direct Forces Support and
                                Defense Support aid.</item>
                            <label>(b)</label>
                            <item>A large part of the military assistance provided by the United
                                States has been in direct response to pressures exerted by the
                                Soviet Bloc in particular areas. For example, whether it be in
                                Berlin, <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0070"/>Korea, the Formosa
                                straits or Indochina, the furnishing of military aid by the United
                                States has been in good part, our reaction to decisions which have
                                been made by the Communist Bloc.</item>
                            <label>(c)</label>
                            <item>Once we have begun to furnish grant aid to a particular country,
                                there is a tendency for it to continue—sometimes despite changed
                                circumstances. This has been true in the past and appears likely to
                                continue into the foreseeable future. This seems due to the
                                following: (1) the initial grant was required because the recipient
                                country’s economy could not support the military capability we had
                                planned for it; still these economic deficiencies are generally not
                                likely to be overcome for many years to come, if ever; (2) once we
                                start rendering aid to a country, it becomes accustomed to it and
                                expects aid in equal, or perhaps greater, amounts; (3) the threat of
                                local aggression or other pressures which caused us to begin an aid
                                program never completely disappear.</item>

                            <item>As a result, the required responses to Soviet bloc pressures in
                                one area after another are cumulative; and attempts to achieve our
                                objectives in all these areas would involve expending our resources
                                in foreign aid programs at an ever increasing rate towards an
                                ultimate total which would be without limit.</item>
                            <label>(e)</label>
                            <item>It is basically more expensive for the United States to render
                                foreign aid than for the Soviet Union. Because of the nature of our
                                economy and the fact that we are a creditor nation we are compelled
                                for the most part to render grant aid; the Soviets, on the other
                                hand, are in a position to trade and to accept goods in return for
                                armaments and other products furnished. They are also willing to
                                make large, long-term loans at low interest rates and payable in
                                local currencies with which we have hitherto not been willing to
                                compete.</item>
                            <label>(f)</label>
                            <item>As a result, Soviet aid is ostensibly presented as a commercial
                                trading proposition without strings, whereas U.S. aid is for the
                                most part grants with political commitments; the attitude of the
                                recipients towards the U.S. and towards the Soviet varies
                                accordingly.</item>
                            <label>(g)</label>
                            <item>Foreign aid recipients expect more from the U.S. than from the
                                Soviets. Thus Soviet aid, or even promises of aid, are heralded with
                                far greater welcome than are U.S. grants many times the size.
                                Moreover, in areas where the U.S. has granted less than was expected
                                or has slowed down or stretched out deliveries, we are put in the
                                position of qualifying our promises at the same time the Soviets are
                                making new ones.</item>

                    <p>If it is assumed that so far expenditures in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1956 and future years will not substantially exceed the

                        into the present level of expenditures for other national security programs,
                        then foreign aid must be financed on an annual basis of somewhere in the
                        neighborhood of $4 billion.</p>
                    <p>Recent Soviet moves and other developments suggest that the U.S. must
                        consider embarking upon a substantially greater program of grant aid in the
                        Middle East (military or economic), possibly amounting on an annual basis to
                        some $.5 billion. This may mean that present programs in other areas should
                        be carefully reexamined to see whether we are receiving a proper return on
                        our investment and whether the present priorities continue to have

                    <p>With the exception of Yugoslavia, where the present program is currently
                        under review, none of the country programs above listed is presently under
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> study. It therefore seems likely
                        that expenditures of the order indicated above will continue at
                        approximately the present rates and with approximately the above
                        relationship of one country’s program to another’s over the foreseeable
                        future. This means that to the extent the existing order of priority
                        continues, foreign aid may not be available for for other areas, such as the
                        Middle East, where it may be more urgently needed. It also means that under
                        existing policies, dollar demands of these proportions will be a fixed
                        charge over the years to come, comparable in its recurrence to the annual
                        requirements for interest to service the national debt.</p>
                    <p>There are, obviously, very different military, political and economic factors
                        which apply in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and each of the
                        separate countries listed above which, together, are absorbing something on
                        the order of 90% of our foreign aid dollars. In Iran, for example, the size
                        of the planned armed forces is based in part upon the prestige factor and
                        our policy of support to the present regime; the same is to some degree true
                        in Pakistan; in Korea, the force levels have a more militarily immediate
                        purpose by way of deterrence. However, there is one policy issue which is a
                        common denominator applicable to each country:</p>
                    <p>To what extent should the United States continue to sustain force levels,
                        over and above those necessary to preserve internal security, when (1) even
                        present Planning Force Bases “do not represent total military

                        size as to constitute a drain on the local country’s resources which its

                        forces can only exist now and in the foreseeable future through subsidies by
                        the United States at an annual cost of from $100 million to $800 million per

                        on the status of the military assistance program. He pointed out that the
                        information to be given by those who followed him would not stop as of June
                        30, 1955, as in the written status report, but would go down to the end of
                        August. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> then introduced
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGEP1">E. Perkins McGuire</persName> of the
                        Department of Defense, who, with the assistance of charts, covered the
                        following topics: First, <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> participants;
                        second, major <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> items delivered since
                        the beginning of the <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> program; third,
                        allied and Communist forces, indicating the destination of major items
                        delivered to allied forces by the U.S.; fourth, <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> forces, <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0078"/>1950 and
                        1955, being a comparison of the strength of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> forces in these two years; fifth, a recapitulation of
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955–56 <gloss target="#t_MDAP1"
                            >MDAP</gloss> funds; and sixth, the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1957 budget request for military assistance programs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGEP1">McGuire</persName> in turn introduced
                        Brigadier General <persName corresp="#p_WBGJK1">James K. Wilson</persName>,
                        who indicated that he would discuss <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss>
                        deliveries and programs for the entire period <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1950 down to the program now being carried out. This, he
                        said, he would do in three parts. The first part concerned the period <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1950 to 1955. This included comment on the
                        world-wide programs and results for the Fiscal Years 1950 to 1955 together
                        with area programs and results for the Fiscal Years 1950–55.</p>
                    <p>As the second of the three parts of his presentation, General <persName
                            corresp="#p_WBGJK1">Wilson</persName> discussed the <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 military assistance program, which he
                        pointed out was only now ready for final review and implementation. He
                        explained the difficulties by referring to charts indicating the lead times
                        and the screening process through which military assistance programs slowly
                        progressed.</p>
                    <p>The third part of General <persName corresp="#p_WBGJK1">Wilson</persName>’s
                        presentation was devoted to a discussion of the development of the <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 program. This process, said General
                            <persName corresp="#p_WBGJK1">Wilson</persName>, had started in March
                        1955 and would not be completed until Congress finally appropriated the
                        necessary funds some time between May and August 1956. It was estimated that
                        if one added up all the requirements necessary to achieve the objectives of
                        the military assistance program, the cost would be in the neighborhood of
                        $6.7 billion. In point of fact this latter estimate had already been refined
                        down to a budget request figure of about $3 billion.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, General <persName corresp="#p_WBGJK1">Wilson</persName> dealt
                        briefly with each of the three major problems which the military assistance
                        programs presented to the United States—namely, (1) lead times, (2) policy
                        vs. funds, and (3) flexibility. At the conclusion of General <persName
                            corresp="#p_WBGJK1">Wilson</persName>’s remarks, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that it was perfectly clear to
                        him that we were not going at this problem in the right way. We were getting
                        involved in a lot of trouble as a result of requests from the field for
                        programs of military assistance at least twice as large as we were going to
                        attempt to carry out. These programs outlined in the field must henceforth
                        be more accurately tailored to what is available in the United States to
                        finance them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> then called on Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> for the presentation by
                        the International Cooperation Administration of the <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                            >ICA</gloss> program of non-military assistance to friendly foreign
                        nations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> stated that
                        the presentation on these programs would be given by Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_OJH1">John B. Ohly</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                            >ICA</gloss>. Again with the use of charts, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_OJH1">Ohly</persName> covered first the subject of <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> programs by area, <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47"
                            facs="0079"/>including <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956
                        appropriations and the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 proposed
                        program. His second topic covered non-military programs by area. This, said
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OJH1">Ohly</persName>, was designed to illustrate
                        trends in these programs. The subject covered all obligations through 1955,
                        the program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956, and the program
                        proposed for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957. Thirdly, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_OJH1">Ohly</persName> covered what he described as the
                        high-cost programs for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957. He explained
                        that six countries—namely, Korea, Indochina, Turkey, Taiwan, France and
                        Pakistan—accounted for something over 50% of the total assistance costs
                        undergone by the U.S. assistance programs.</p>
                    <p>Thereafter Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OJH1">Ohly</persName> said that he would
                        like to analyze the programs in some detail for two or three significant
                        countries, to illustrate how programs were developed to accomplish U.S.
                        objectives. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OJH1">Ohly</persName> first described
                        Korea, which he said was in a sense the most difficult case, thanks to a
                        combination of many problems. Nevertheless, Korea was like these other
                        countries in that the programs there indicated that the United States was
                        making no progress whatsoever in getting the load off its own back and
                        directing Korea in the path of future stability and self-support.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OJH1">Ohly</persName> said he would next turn to a
                        quite different type of problem, illustrated by India. For that country we
                        were proposing in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 a total program
                        involving about $81 million, of which approximately $10 million would be for
                        technical assistance; the remaining $70 million of developmental assistance
                        was designed to help carry through India’s second five-year plan. The big
                        problem for India, explained Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OJH1"
                        >Ohly</persName>, was the tremendous foreign exchange gap between the $1
                        billion of foreign exchange available to India and the several additional
                        billions which would be required to complete successfully this second
                        five-year plan. The purpose of our program was to help bridge the gap.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OJH1">Ohly</persName>’s
                        presentation, the President said he had a question to address to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> with respect to India.
                        Did Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> think that the
                        United States should, for its own good, spend more than the proposed $71
                        million for economic assistance to India? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"
                            >Hollister</persName> replied that he did not think so, although he said
                        there were two schools of thought on this issue within the Administration.
                        The President said that he felt that it was clearly to the security
                        advantage of the United States to have certain important countries like
                        India strong enough to remain neutral or at least “neutral on our side”. For
                        one thing, such neutral countries were less exposed to attack by the
                        Communists. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed
                        out that had Korea been stated to be a U.S. ally, it was very unlikely that
                        Korea would have been overtly attacked by the Communists.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> then said that he would
                        like to make a few general observations with respect to the assistance
                        programs for which the <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0080"/><gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> was responsible. It seemed obvious, said
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>, that the United States
                        cannot do more by way of extending assistance than we have money available
                        for that purpose. The prime problem, therefore, was the problem of priority.
                        Military and economic assistance programs were closely intertwined and
                        interdependent, but the entire resulting program was of enormous magnitude.
                        The U.S. Ambassadors in particular foreign countries, not to mention the
                        local authorities in these countries, were all pushing as hard as they could
                        to get the assistance programs for these countries carried through to their
                        conclusions. In point of fact, however, there was simply not enough money
                        available to carry out all these programs. The problem remained of what we
                        should spend and how much assistance we can afford to give.</p>
                    <p>Among the special problems he wished to single out, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> mentioned the problem of
                        providing economic and budgetary support to countries which were unable with
                        their own resources to maintain military establishments at the required
                        levels. Such economic support programs were of course necessary. We cannot
                        forever stay on the defensive, and this economic aid helped us to take the
                        offensive in various countries so that they could make progress in the
                        direction of the goal of standing on their own financial feet. In many
                        countries, however—notably in Korea—it required all the money that the
                        United States could pour in by way of assistance, simply to enable Korea to
                        stand still and not recede into worse economic difficulties. Accordingly,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> again stressed the need
                        for a study of the type of problem illustrated by Korea. In such countries
                        we had no option but to reduce our sights or else to increase our
                        expenditures if such countries were ever to be in a position to stand on
                        their own feet.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> then said that there was
                        also need of an over-all study of where the United States was going in the
                        field of assistance to the underdeveloped countries of the free world. If
                        their problems were to be met successfully, a very different solution would
                        have to be sought than the solution in Europe achieved by the Marshall Plan.
                        Marshall Plan aid would simply not work in the underdeveloped areas of the
                        world as it had worked in highly industrialized Western Europe. Accordingly,
                        a different approach must be studied, and this approach was made the more
                        urgent because of the recent Russian maneuvers in the field of economic and
                        technical assistance in the Near East and South Asia. Many people were
                        saying that what we needed were new and dynamic programs for these
                        underdeveloped areas. With this view Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"
                            >Hollister</persName> said he had complete sympathy, but what kind of
                        programs were actually envisaged? Of one thing he was certain: We could not
                        meet the needs of the underdeveloped areas by simply spending lavishly.</p>
                    <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0081"/>
                    <p>Finally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> said that he
                        was also in agreement with those who stressed the importance of greater
                        flexibility in the management of our foreign assistance programs and on the
                        desirability of larger contingency funds to meet emergencies which might
                        occur in countries which we were assisting. It was a real question, however,
                        whether Congress could be induced to agree to place more of the funds it
                        appropriated for foreign assistance in the category of contingency funds.
                        Moreover, the countries who were beneficiaries of our assistance programs
                        would not welcome a cut in the funds appropriated for the regular assistance
                        program in order that larger sums could be reserved for unforeseen
                        contingencies.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>’s
                        comments, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> said
                        that the third portion of this review of military assistance and supporting
                        programs would consist of a presentation by the Executive Officer of the
                        Operations Coordinating Board, of the report on “Constabulary Forces in
                        Countries Threatened by Subversion”, prepared by the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
                            >OCB</gloss> pursuant to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No.
                        1290–d. Mr. <persName>Staats</persName> summarized the aforementioned
                        report, and concluded with an estimate that it would cost approximately $15
                        million, in addition to the $50 million now being spent annually on the
                        internal security aspects of the mutual security program, to carry out the
                        objectives set forth in the report.</p>
                    <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> had spoken
                        briefly on aspects of the internal security program for these foreign
                        countries, … Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName>
                        pointed out that the 1290–d study had been considered by the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board. Although the Planning Board
                        had no comments to offer to the Council on the subject, it had taken into
                        consideration this study when it had made its recommendations to the
                        National Security Council on the over-all problem of our military assistance
                        and supporting programs. He then called on Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> to give the views of the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff with respect to this study on constabulary forces.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> read from the
                        memorandum which the Joint Chiefs had sent on December 6 to the Secretary of
                            Defense,<note n="7" xml:id="d13fn7">See <ref target="#d13fn4">footnote
                                4</ref> above.</note> giving their views as to the 1290–d study on
                        constabulary forces in countries threatened by subversion. In general, said
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff were in strong agreement as to the desirability of professional police
                        forces in such countries. They believed, however, that the present report
                        conveyed the misleading impression that provision of such internal security
                        and police forces offered a possibility of considerable savings in the
                        military programs for the countries in question. On the contrary, the Joint
                        Chiefs of <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0082"/>Staff believed that
                        implementing the proposed program for police and constabulary forces would
                        involve an additional expense.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that the fact of the matter was that three different
                        parts of the Executive Branch were presently engaged in executing programs
                        to help these threatened countries to maintain their internal security.
                        These three were the Defense Department, … and the <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                            >ICA</gloss>. In the light of this situation, the National Security
                        Council had every right to know how effectively these departments were doing
                        the job. The report presented by the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> did
                        not contain any recommendations on which the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> was obliged to act, and accordingly the President could
                        perceive no reason why the Joint Chiefs of Staff should have become so
                        excited about it.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed out that the
                        Joint Chiefs would not have been excited had they been aware that no action
                        on this report was contemplated by the Council. Meanwhile, the President
                        went on to express his growing conviction that in many parts of the free
                        world all that the United States could possibly hope to do militarily was to
                        build up strong and stable governments in nations who would be neutral and
                        accordingly on our side. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName> replied that the great fear of the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff was that these programs to build up internal security and stability
                        might appear to provide a basis for effecting savings on the military
                        programs designed to prevent these countries from falling victim to outside
                        aggression as opposed to internal subversion.</p>
                    <p>The President went on to state his firm belief that the provisions in many of
                        our treaties with other countries, to the effect that an attack on one
                        constituted an attack on all, were wise provisions. Nevertheless, we should
                        do everything we can to assist these countries to reach a position where
                        they can help themselves, especially by building up strong internal
                        political and economic stability. The President said that he had in mind the
                        spectacle ….</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> pointed out that it
                        was thanks to such considerations as the President had emphasized that the
                            <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> report merely called for noting by
                        the National Security Council. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1"
                            >Anderson</persName> whether he was to deduce from this last remark that
                        the study was to be treated as if it were merely academic. For one thing,
                        said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, there was no
                        clear delineation of responsibility for carrying out programs designed to
                        enhance the internal security of these states threatened by Communist
                        subversion. At the present time such responsibility was divided among a
                        number of different agencies. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> expressed the hope that the Council might at least
                        issue a directive assigning this responsibility to one man or one agency.
                        The President replied that he did not believe that any action by the
                        National Security <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0083"/>Council was
                        necessary to assign such responsibility. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1"
                            >Dillon Anderson</persName> suggested that the Operations Coordinating
                        Board itself was the obvious agency to coordinate this program. After all,
                        it was the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> which had made the study.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Staats</persName> said he appreciated the problem which
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had emphasized, and
                        said that the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> had tried to approach the
                        problem by spelling out in its report the agency or agencies who were
                        responsible for action on this program in each of the 18 countries. He said
                        he also believed that over-all leadership in carrying out this program
                        should be assigned to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> added that a special
                        office had been set up already in the International Cooperation
                        Administration for the precise purpose of providing this over-all
                        leadership.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> expressed the opinion
                        that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> might at least contemplate
                        doing more than merely noting the completion of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
                            >OCB</gloss> report on constabulary forces. Might not the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> also indicate its anticipation that the
                        programs analyzed in this report would be effectively carried out? In reply
                        to Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>, the President
                        said that when he had originally requested the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
                            >OCB</gloss> to make this report, all that he had in mind was need for
                        information on the subject of constabulary and police forces. He had not
                        intended to agree or to disagree with the findings of the report.
                        Responsible agencies exist whose job it was to carry out this program. He
                        accordingly could perceive no need for further action along this line by the
                        National Security Council. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName>, however, returned to his point and said that in
                        view of the fact that the struggle between the free world and the Communist
                        world was likely to be fought in the future in the area of internal
                        subversion rather than in that of overt aggression, it was more important
                        than ever to pay attention to the problems raised by the <gloss
                            target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> report. This might mean that we would
                        proceed to cut down the military force goals which we had set up for
                        countries like Korea, and substitute for them new guidelines more in keeping
                        with the character of the struggle which we were likely to face. The
                        President replied that Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName>’s point was part of a much larger problem. To this
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> answered that there
                        was an obvious need to indicate clearly that we are shifting to a new form
                        of the long struggle against Communist totalitarianism. The President said
                        that on this point, at least, he couldn’t agree more. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> said that the
                        recommendations of the Planning Board on the general subject of military
                        assistance certainly touched on the matter which Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> had emphasized.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> indicated that he
                        wished to be heard on this subject. He pointed out that the National
                        Security Council had in this report a study which was very thorough, very
                        important, and <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0084"/>very enlightening in
                        character. He would therefore like to hope that the Council would not treat
                        the report on constabulary forces as a mere matter of academic interest, but
                        that the result of the Council’s consideration of the report would at least
                        be a greater concentration of effort to achieve a higher degree of internal
                        security in countries exposed to subversion. In short, he hoped that this
                        report would not result in the program becoming a step-child. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> explained that he was not
                        calling for any specific <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> endorsement of
                        the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> report, but at least some expression
                        of the necessity that some one individual or agency be charged with
                        responsibility for carrying out this program. After Mr.
                            <persName>Staats</persName> had pointed out again that in each country
                        covered by the study, recommendations had been made by the <gloss
                            target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> report as to what agency or agencies should
                        be responsible for carrying out the program in that country, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he would be
                        satisfied if the International Cooperation Agency were clearly charged with
                        over-all coordination of this program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                            Dulles</persName> said he thought it would be eminently sensible to have
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> act as general
                        coordinator of this program.</p>
                    <p>The President said that this proposal was perfectly agreeable to him; but
                        after all, in the military circles in which he had spent so much of his
                        life, it was normal to expect that after a report was made there were people
                        on hand who were expected to carry out its recommendations. That was the
                        kind of staff work that the President said he had been used to. If the
                        expected action did not occur, some officer or officers found themselves
                        reduced a grade or two.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> then stated that he
                        thought the point had been reached in the Council’s discussion of the
                        general problem of military assistance and supporting programs, for it to
                        take action on the recommendations of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> Planning Board. He accordingly read the first
                        recommendation, which noted the high proportion of U.S. assistance being
                        received by Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Vietnam, Formosa and Korea, and which
                        suggested that an appropriate group or agency proceed with an urgent study
                        of the assistance programs for these six countries. Thereafter the Planning
                        Board would be directed to review the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        policies relating to these countries. After he had read these
                        recommendations, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName>
                        described the make-up of a new interdepartmental group<note n="8"
                            xml:id="d13fn8">The Interdepartmental Committee on Certain U.S. Aid
                            Programs under the chairmanship of Deputy Under Secretary of State
                                <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName>.</note> which was in
                        a position to make the studies called for and which Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> recommended to the Council should
                        be designated to make the studies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1"
                            >Anderson</persName>
                        <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0085"/>then read to the Council the terms of
                        reference of this new interdepartmental committee.<note n="9"
                            xml:id="d13fn9"><ref target="#d12"><hi rend="italic"
                            >Supra</hi></ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>The President then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName>
                        how long the new interdepartmental committee had been meeting. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> replied that the committee had been
                        set up in the first instance last July or August to study the financial
                        situation in Turkey. The President then expressed his approval of the
                        interdepartmental committee, but said he wished to emphasize the need for
                        recognizing that the character of the struggle between the U.S. and the USSR
                        was clearly changing. Accordingly the philosophy behind some of the earlier
                        courses of action in this struggle was likewise changing. The Republic of
                        Korea might constitute an example of what he meant, said the President. In
                        any case, the United States must keep abreast of the changing circumstances
                        in which the struggle against Communism was being conducted. Whether or not
                        we needed studies of these six countries was open to question. It might be
                        better if the National Security Council itself should sit down and talk over
                        these countries. In any event, the guidelines must issue from what the
                        National Security Council thought about the changing situation now
                        represented by the new Russian tactics. After further explanation by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName>, the President stated
                        that he had no objection to the proposed interdepartmental committee making
                        its studies, provided there was clear realization of the change in tactics
                        that has overtaken us.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he believed that
                        the studies proposed in the Planning Board recommendation ought to be made.
                        It was important, however, that the interdepartmental committee approach its
                        function with the highest policy considerations in mind. Soviet policy had
                        shifted, as the President had pointed out, but the precise direction of the
                        shift was not yet wholly clear. It is also necessary to realize why the
                        Soviets have shifted, namely, because the free world has found military
                        formulas which have compelled them to shift to less violent and militarily
                        aggressive policies. It should also be borne in mind, however, that the
                        Soviets are really not cutting down the size of their own military forces,
                        and accordingly the United States must be careful not to lower its own
                        military guard lest, after doing so, the Soviets should suddenly revert to
                        their old tactics employing aggressive military force. It was quite
                        possible, thought Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>,
                        that it was not necessary to maintain as many as 20 active divisions in the
                        Army of the Republic of Korea. Nevertheless, we must be very careful not to
                        assume that the only danger facing the free world is the danger of cold
                        war.</p>
                    <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0086"/>
                    <p>The President replied that of course he didn’t want extremes, either the
                        extreme of all military and no economic assistance for these countries, or
                        all economic and no military. We should strike a mean and realize that we
                        are playing this game of trying to outwit the Russians on something like a
                        40-year basis. Accordingly we could not always use the same tactics in
                        trying to win the game. We must be ready to adjust to changes in the
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that the
                        biggest single difficulty that the United States faced in administering its
                        assistance programs was the unwillingness of many of these countries who
                        were beneficiaries of these programs genuinely to rely on the deterrent
                        power of the striking force of the United States. What they wanted were
                        visible military forces on their own soil. We therefore had the problem of
                        educating the peoples and governments of these countries as to the
                        effectiveness of our deterrent force, and to convince them that this
                        deterrent will work even if they have much smaller military forces of their
                        own. This might well, for instance, apply to Korea. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> warned, however, that we could not
                        hastily change the situation in Korea by urging a sudden reduction of the
                        level of South Korean military forces to a point where they would be more
                        nearly supported by the South Korean economy. Sudden action of this sort
                        might well break the morale of South Korea. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> recalled the President’s statement
                        when the first American divisions were called back from South Korea. It had
                        been a fine statement, but it had been very hard “to sell to the
                        Koreans”.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> counselled building
                        up more reserve divisions in South Korea and reducing the number of active
                        divisions. He cited figures which indicated that the United States was
                        putting into the South Korean economy each year a sum equivalent to the
                        Gross National Product of South Korea. No wonder, he said, there was a 25%
                        inflation in South Korea. We must take a look at this situation, especially
                        in view of the new Russian economic challenge.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that the Russian challenge was not a genuine
                        challenge, inasmuch as it was not the real intention of the Russians to
                        assist the economies of the countries they professed to aid. Nevertheless,
                        it was a very difficult job to meet the new Russian tactics—almost as hard,
                        said the President, as it had earlier been to meet the military
                        challenge.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> then referred to the views
                        of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in opposition to the recommendations of the
                        Planning Board for a study of the assistance programs in these six
                        countries, but suggested, in view of the hour, that the Council adjourn for
                        lunch and begin its afternoon session with a statement by Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> of the views of the Joint Chiefs
                        of Staff. This proposal was accepted.</p>
                    <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0087"/>
                    <p>When the National Security Council reconvened at 1:45, Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> was asked to give the views of the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff on paragraph 1 of the Planning Board recommendations.
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> stated that the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff had had but limited time in which to prepare comment
                        on these recommendations, and that they had not actually been discussed by
                        the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Chiefs felt, however, that while the studies
                        called for in the Planning Board recommendation might provide certain
                        interesting information, the real difficulty with our military assistance
                        programs emerged from the fact that the level of military forces maintained
                        in these countries derived directly from national security policies of the
                        United States vis-à-vis these countries. Accordingly, the Chiefs recommended
                        against singling out these six countries for special studies.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> then went on to give
                        the Chiefs’ views with respect to the second recommendation of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board<note n="10" xml:id="d13fn10"
                            >Reference is to Majority Proposal No. 2 in the Enclosure to <ref
                                target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.</note> on the subject of greater
                        flexibility and, in particular, the use of a larger contingency fund as
                        opposed to specific appropriations for military and economic assistance.
                        Noting that there was a split in the Planning Board recommendation between
                        the majority proposal, which called for an additive contingency fund of
                        several hundred million dollars, and the proposal of the Budget and
                        Treasury, which would simply earmark a certain proportion of the total funds
                        appropriated by Congress for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 foreign
                        aid programs, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said
                        the Joint Chiefs of Staff favored the majority proposal with the additive
                        contingency fund. The Chiefs did not believe it wise or feasible to reduce
                        the size of the regular programs through the agency of larger contingency
                        funds, as proposed by Budget and Treasury.</p>
                    <p>On the subject of the views of the Chiefs of Staff on the first
                        recommendation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> said that
                        the Planning Board was well aware of the relation between national security
                        policy and the level of forces in these six countries. It was for this very
                        reason that the Planning Board had suggested that after the
                        interdepartmental committee had studied the military and economic assistance
                        programs in these six countries, the Planning Board should review the
                        policies of the United States toward these countries in the light of the
                        interdepartmental committee studies.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed out that the
                        great problem in countries such as Korea, Taiwan and Turkey, was the
                        difficulty of persuading them that their national security could be
                        adequately maintained even if we suggested cuts in force levels when we had
                        initially <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0088"/>insisted that these were
                        the minimum levels which were required for the maintenance of security.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that while this
                        was certainly a difficulty, it was essential to do something about the
                        situation in these countries. He agreed with the Secretary of State that the
                        deterrent power of the United States was the real shield for these
                        countries, and he repeated his view that Korea should have 15 regular and 15
                        reserve divisions rather than the current 20 regular divisions and 10
                        reserve divisions.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said that whatever
                        the merits of the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he was at a loss to
                        understand why there could be any objection to a study of the military and
                        economic assistance programs of the United States in these six countries.
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied by stating
                        again the Chiefs’ view that most of the information we needed about these
                        programs and the ability of the economies of the six countries in question
                        to maintain them, was already available. He also pointed out that we are
                        reducing our strength in Korea while the enemy is building up his. The
                        Koreans would tend to rely for their national security on such forces as
                        they can actually see on hand and in the field.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that the real question was whether our national
                        security policies vis-à-vis Korea and these other countries should be looked
                        at once again. He said he believed a review of our policies was clearly in
                        order every time we saw a significant change in the international scene. It
                        was simply a matter of taking a new look, although the President said he
                        must admit that he would hate to have the job of convincing Synghman
                            Rhee<note n="11" xml:id="d13fn11">President of the Republic of
                            Korea.</note> that he didn’t really need 20 active divisions to protect
                        his country.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> inquired whether, if
                        these studies should bring us to the conclusion that we cannot change our
                        policy toward these six countries, the military and economic assistance
                        funds we had asked for would prove to be adequate to carry out our existing
                        national security policies. Or were we anticipating changes in policy and
                        reductions in the level of military and economic assistance in calculating
                        the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 budget requests.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied to Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> by stating that it was
                        simply impossible to achieve our current military and economic assistance
                        objectives with funds presently available. It had been a very tough squeeze
                        this time, and we just couldn’t do it. Accordingly, we must either make
                        changes in our policy objectives or else go above the $36 billion level for
                        the Defense Department budget for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1957.</p>
                    <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0089"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> said that he deduced from
                        the character of the discussion that the National Security Council agreed
                        with the Planning Board’s first recommendation and authorized it to be
                        carried out. The President said that was his idea.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> then directed the
                        Council’s attention to the second recommendation of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board, which called for greater
                        flexibility in the provision of military and economic assistance by the
                        United States to friendly countries. He explained the majority proposal,
                        which called for a contingency fund of several hundred million dollars in
                        addition to the specific appropriation for military and economic assistance,
                        and also pointed out the view of the Budget and Treasury that no additive
                        contingency fund should be sought from the Congress, but that, instead, a
                        substantial portion of the total <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957
                        foreign aid funds should be earmarked to form a contingency fund.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> expressed surprise
                        that the issue of the size and form of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1957 foreign aid program should have come before the National Security
                        Council, inasmuch as he believed that he had already committed himself on
                        this point prior to the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> inquired whether
                        there was any reason in the world why we should not seek greater flexibility
                        in our funding of all our programs. Was there any conceivable objection to
                        greater flexibility? Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
                        replied by pointing out that those who were responsible for developing and
                        executing the regular programs for military assistance over a period of
                        years had to know precisely how much money was available to them for each
                        program in each country. This knowledge for planning purposes would be
                        denied to these people if the funds for the regular programs were cut down
                        by the creation of large contingency funds. He predicted that to do so would
                        get us into trouble with various friendly countries where we were carrying
                        out military assistance programs on a basis of continuity.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said he still
                        favored the principle of flexibility, and we should not let ourselves be got
                        into a vise with regard to these assistance programs if the Congress did not
                        force us into a vise by specifying precisely how much could be spent in each
                        country for each program. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName> said he feared we were already in a vise with
                        respect to many of our programs. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> said our objective should be to keep down our new aid
                        commitments to a very austere basis, and put enough money aside to permit
                        real flexibility. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>
                        pronounced himself as strongly opposed to any additive contingency fund.</p>
                    <p>The President reminded the Council that of course they were not discussing
                        the content of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 budget. This
                        matter had already been decided. Nevertheless, the President believed that
                        Admiral <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0090"/><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName> had emphasized a significant point, namely, that a
                        large proportion of the costs of our military assistance programs in various
                        countries derived from our obligation to provide maintenance and spare parts
                        for equipment which had already been shipped to these countries. Naturally
                        this situation got us into a box, and there would be inevitable
                        inflexibility if the United States was bound to maintain the equipment
                        earlier delivered under military assistance programs. This was why, when he
                        had been Commander in Chief, he had urged the European nations to assume
                        greater responsibility for maintenance and spare parts. This was likewise
                        why he had consistently favored offshore procurement programs.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gordon Gray</persName> interposed to
                        remind the Council that in discussing the problem of maintenance it should
                        remember that maintenance in the sense of keeping vehicles running was one
                        kind of problem, but that program maintenance was a much larger thing. As
                        for the contingency fund, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG2"
                            >Gray</persName> said that he strongly supported the views of the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff in favor of the additive proposal.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> again inquired whether
                        this discussion had any reference to the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1957 budget. He judged, from the wording of the Planning Board’s
                        recommendation, that it must have. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1"
                            >Anderson</persName>, however, explained that the budget-making process
                        had probably gone too far to permit the inclusion of an additive contingency
                        fund at this time.</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> pointed out that ever
                        since he had sat with the National Security Council he had clearly
                        understood that you could not settle on the size and character of a budget
                        if you concentrated your attention on one single item, such as foreign aid.
                        This was especially true with regard to the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1957 budget.</p>
                    <p>The President thought that we should hang on to the existing $100 million
                        provided in the budget for contingencies which might affect the military
                        assistance programs. This was of particular value when the Congress was not
                        in session. If, when it was in session, some unforeseen emergency arose, it
                        was always possible to go to the Congress and ask for additional funds.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that in that case it
                        seemed to him that the principle behind this recommendation of the Planning
                        Board had already been incorporated in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1957 budget. The only remaining question was whether or not $100 million was
                        enough to provide for contingencies affecting the military assistance
                        program. The President said he believed it was enough.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> advocated an attempt to
                        induce Congress to provide larger discretionary funds at the same time that
                        it cut down on the specific funds to be allotted to the regular assistance
                        programs. <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0091"/>He admitted, however, that
                        it would be hard to get Congress to provide very extensive discretionary
                        funds.</p>
                    <p>The President said that in defense of the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        on this subject, it should be realized that a military assistance program
                        does not consist only of military matériel and munitions. Such programs have
                        to allow for training and a lot of other things. The military units must be
                        planned and activated on the spot so that they can be ready to use guns and
                        equipment when they arrive. These foreign forces must know, accordingly,
                        what they can expect from us and approximately when they can expect it. If
                        we did not keep our promises we could get into trouble. Accordingly the
                        President did not believe it was practical to follow Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>’s proposal of larger
                        discretionary funds and smaller regular appropriations for the military
                        assistance programs. It would be impossible to plan armies on such a
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that be was
                        greatly troubled by growing maintenance costs as against the need for having
                        funds to provide new matériel and new weapons to our allies. He was also
                        uneasy because the United States itself had too many men in uniform
                        scattered in too many parts of the world. The Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        recognize this as one of our main problems. The President agreed, and said
                        that of course there was not really a modern weapon in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> then asked the Council
                        whether either the majority or the Budget–Treasury proposal on flexibility
                        was acceptable to the National Security Council. The President replied by
                        stating that the second recommendation should be revised and put in very
                        general terms, namely, that the United States should seek maximum
                        flexibility while at the same time recognizing the need for some degree of
                        fixity in developing its military assistance programs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> then asked the Council to
                        express an opinion on the third recommendation of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board, as to the desirability of
                        seeking greater latitude in the granting of military and economic assistance
                        than was currently permitted by existing statutory requirements relating to
                        commitments or policies of the recipient countries. The President replied
                        that he thought everyone present would agree on this recommendation, but
                        that they had all better start hiring their lobbyists to work on the
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>(At this point the Secretary of State, who was obliged to leave shortly to
                        make a speech in Chicago, introduced the subject of export controls on trade
                        with Communist China, discussion of which is covered under the next
                        item.)</p>
                    <p>After discussion of the issue raised by the Secretary of State, the National
                        Security Council resumed discussion of the fourth recommendation of the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board, with respect to the
                        review of <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0092"/>military assistance and
                        supporting programs. The Council agreed to accept the fourth recommendation,
                        which consisted of a request that the responsible departments and agencies
                        devise programming, clearance, and allocations-of-funds techniques for
                        military assistance programs aimed at reducing the time-span involved
                        between the initiation of new fiscal year programming and clearance for
                        delivery of the first items to be shipped.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that the
                        Defense Department was engaged in doing this anyhow, but that no doubt it
                        could be done more effectively.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> then read the fifth and
                        last recommendation of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning
                        Board, which called for a request on the International Development Advisory
                        Board, chaired by <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName>, to
                        review U.S. economic aid programs and to report to the Council through the
                        Director, <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, on the level and types of
                        economic assistance required in the underdeveloped areas in order best to
                        achieve the long-range objectives of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> immediately expressed
                        doubt as to the desirability of Council approval of this recommendation. It
                        seemed to him that the considerations which determined the level and
                        character of our economic aid were matters of high policy involving
                        classified information, and should not, therefore, be farmed out to an
                        outside group which had no responsibility for administering this assistance.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> suggested instead
                        that the study of U.S. assistance to underdeveloped areas be done by the
                        staff of the International Cooperation Administration. If any outside
                        assistance should be needed, the group headed by Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> would be useful. The Board could be
                        asked from time to time to give their views on certain specific problems.
                        The <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> group was advisory in
                        character and not self-starting.</p>
                    <p>The President said that provided officials in the Government could find time
                        to make such studies as were called for in this recommendation, they were
                        best fitted to do so. But it was sometimes difficult for busy officials to
                        take time out to make such long-range studies.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> also expressed concern lest an
                        outside study group come back with recommendations regarding long-range
                        assistance to underdeveloped countries which would be completely out of line
                        with existing U.S. policy and with available funds for such a program. It
                        was particularly likely to be embarrassing if the results of such outside
                        studies became public knowledge.</p>
                    <p>The President, however, said that we had had pretty good luck thus far with
                        our outside groups, and that they had mostly kept the secrets which had been
                        entrusted to them. On the other hand, the <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61"
                            facs="0093"/>President said he was willing to defer action on this
                        recommendation, and that a decision could subsequently [be] made after
                        discussion with the responsible agency heads. It would probably be OK for
                        this Board to consult with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"
                            >Hollister</persName> as the Secretary of State had suggested.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that the
                        great difficulty with such problems as long-range assistance to
                        underdeveloped areas, was the necessity of solving them in the light of all
                        the many considerations of policy, It was quite easy to solve them in
                        isolation. Thus the problem of assistance to Afghanistan, while apparently
                        economic, was really largely political in character. For the solution of
                        such problems, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said,
                        he generally opposed outside groups and committees.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he agreed
                        with the Secretary of State. We knew, said Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, more now than we know what to do
                        about. (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>The President, addressing himself to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, defended outside committees, and spoke very warmly
                        of the services which the <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>
                            Commission<note n="12" xml:id="d13fn12">The Commission on Foreign
                            Economic Policy, composed of both private citizens and members of

                                Randall</persName>, was established by President <persName

                        Administration. He again insisted that the real question was that of time
                        available to overworked Government officials. Outside groups can often give
                        the requisite time when responsible officials cannot do so. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said he believed that the
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> Commission report was
                        largely window-dressing for an Administration policy already adopted. The
                        President, on the other hand, credited the <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                            >Randall</persName> Commission with actually setting forth a new policy
                        in its area of study.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the problem of availability of time, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that the setting up of a
                        study by <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName>’s group would
                        actually constitute a heavy drain on his time rather than saving it. The
                        Secretary of State would have to spend a lot of hours educating the Board if
                        he was to be sure that its final report would not be partial or
                        incomplete.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said that if the Director of the <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                            >ICA</gloss> could, in accordance with the usual practice, ask Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> and the International
                        Development Advisory Board to study certain specific problems and suggest
                        any new ideas to the responsible departments or to the National Security
                        Council, this might be a useful contribution.</p>
                    <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0094"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> was then asked to list
                        the membership of the International Development Advisory Board. When he had
                        got part way through the list of its members, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> interrupted to say that he had
                        heard enough, and that he was still opposed to the use of this Board. The
                        President observed that it looked to him as though those around the table
                        did not wish to make direct use of the International Development Advisory
                        Board as suggested by this recommendation, although of course Mr. <persName

                    <p>At this point in the discussion Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> said he had some observations which could probably be
                        made either at this point or in connection with the next item on the agenda;
                        namely, U.S. Economic Assistance for Asia. The President suggested that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> state what he wished
                        at this point.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that the essence
                        of his remarks would be to point out that the United States had very largely
                        failed to appreciate the impact on the underdeveloped areas of the world of
                        the phenomenon of Russia’s rapid industrialization. This transformation of
                        Russia from an agrarian to a modern industrial state was an historical event
                        of absolutely first class importance. It challenged the industrial and
                        political supremacy that up until now the West could maintain over the
                        underdeveloped nations of the world. Now, however, these nations and
                        especially those in Asia were being enormously impressed with the
                        transformation which had been accomplished by the Soviet Union. The prestige
                        of the “Great American Experiment” which had begun a hundred years ago was
                        being diminished in the light of the “Great Russian Experiment” which had
                        been achieved in some 30 years. Moreover, continued <pb n="65"
                            xml:id="pg_65" facs="0097"/>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, these underdeveloped countries either forget or are
                        indifferent to the terrible cruelties and hardships which have accompanied
                        the transformation of the Russian state. All they see are the results of
                        Russia’s industrialization and all they want is for the Russians to show
                        them how they too can achieve it. We can ill afford to ignore the enormous
                        impact on Asians and other underdeveloped areas which the Russians have
                        made. It constitutes a very serious problem which we are not adequately
                        meeting at the present time although the assistance program which we are
                        about to present to the Congress will certainly help. In conclusion of his
                        statement. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> warned
                        that if the United States failed to solve this problem, the Soviet Union
                        would end by dominating all of Asia.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said he thought he
                        understood what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        meant. Nevertheless, he did not see how we can expect in the future anything
                        but continued Soviet competition. Russia had very great natural resources.
                        Much of it was in the Temperate Zone and the Russians were an industrious
                        people. Inevitably, in the future, the Soviet Union will be a great
                        competitor of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> suggested that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> was missing the
                        point of his warning. The point was that the transformation of Russia had
                        happened so rapidly and so dramatically that it had made an enormous
                        impression upon the underdeveloped nations who sought an equally rapid
                        change in their society.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> went on to say that
                        he was greatly worried because the industrial transformation of the Soviet
                        Union had been the work of a totalitarian government. Ours, on the other
                        hand, was the product of private and free enterprise. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said that we should not,
                        accordingly, by virtue of our assistance programs create and maintain other
                        government-controlled economies in the underdeveloped nations of Asia and
                        Africa. To do this would be self-defeating for the United States.</p>
                    <p>The President reminded Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> that there were all kinds and degrees of socialized
                        societies throughout the world. There was even some socialization in the
                        United States itself. We did not need to fear a socialized state as
                        something inimical to us in itself. Sweden was a highly socialized state and
                        Norway only less so. Both were warm friends of the United States. What we
                        must guard against is socialization which goes the whole way and uses
                        totalitarian methods so that the state in question ultimately comes under
                        the control of Moscow. If this should happen in enough instances, the United
                        States itself would finally “go down the drain.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> continued to express
                        his anxiety lest we build up a whole series of images of Moscow in the
                        backward countries we were assisting. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName>, however, strongly <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66"
                            facs="0098"/>supported the views of Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> that we should move at once on this
                        problem. The important thing was to back private enterprise as much as
                        possible in the countries we were assisting. It was for this reason, said
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>, that he had been so
                        concerned with assistance to build up the Tata enterprises in India.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said that of course
                        he was not arguing that we should sit still and do nothing. We should,
                        however, move in the direction of freedom of the individual and private
                        enterprise in the countries we were assisting rather than to support
                        government control of industry.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> pointed out that it
                        was going to be very hard for the United States to compete with cheap Soviet
                        money as had been shown by our attitude toward a loan to the Tata interests
                        in India. The President said that there was perhaps one comforting thought
                        that might be drawn from this gloomy picture. A country which has developed
                        some degree of industrialization is much more prone to revolt than a country
                        which still is based on a primitive agrarian economy. History proved this
                        point. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> added that a
                        country which has developed a reasonable degree of industrialization is much
                        more likely to evolve than a country whose economy remains basically
                        agrarian. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> added his
                        opinion that the best thing that Russia could do for the United States would
                        be to manufacture and distribute five million automobiles to the citizens of
                        the U.S.S.R.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Streibert</persName> said that he felt constrained to point out
                        that in our dealings with the Asian people, we were concerned with ideas
                        just as much as with pure economics. The Soviets had been assiduously and
                        successfully planting in Asia the idea that Communism was the wave of the
                        future and that capitalism was dying. Mr. <persName>Streibert</persName>
                        believed that we would derive more profit from our aid programs if we kept
                        in mind, in connection with them, the need of supporting the ideals of free
                        enterprise and enlightened capitalism. We must not minimize the impact of
                        ideas on the minds of the people of Asia.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                        regrettable as it might be, most of the free countries of Asia have such
                        primitive societies and governments that there is no private enterprise
                        which can be developed and supported by U.S. assistance programs. Agreeing
                        with Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>, the President observed that of course
                        we have got to start with what we have got. We must try to bring the patient
                        along. We cannot let these Asian nations go down the drain and be swallowed
                        up by the Soviet Union while we are engaged in a campaign to promote the
                        ideals of free enterprise.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President observed that from the point of view of his experience in
                        the Asian countries, there was one point worth bearing <pb n="67"
                            xml:id="pg_67" facs="0099"/>in mind. One or another of the great powers
                        is certainly going to develop the backward nations of Asia. Unless,
                        therefore, the United States assists these countries (trying as far as
                        possible to develop private enterprise), the Soviets will do it instead. If
                        this latter happens, the assisted country first becomes an economic
                        satellite of the Soviet Union and shortly thereafter a political and
                        military satellite. The Vice President concluded by stating his agreement
                        with the President that the United States would have to work in Asia with
                        what it found there. This might mean that we would have to assist in the
                        development of government-controlled enterprise rather than to work with a
                        free enterprise system as we would naturally prefer.</p>
                    <p>After this discussion Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>
                        indicated that there were one or two more points to be covered in his
                        intelligence briefing. He wished to point out that the Soviet foreign
                        assistance program would henceforth be run by a semi-autonomous office
                        directly under the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> believed that this step was of great
                        significance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> also pointed out that the
                        Soviet Ambassador to Brussels had at last “wangled” an invitation from the
                        Belgian Government to make a tour of the Belgian Congo. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> thought that Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> would be particularly interested
                        in this development.</p>
                    <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> had commented briefly
                        on Soviet offers of economic assistance to Libya, the Sudan, and to the
                        Latin American Republics, the President said he wished to put a question to
                        the National Security Council. Why did the United States not send high-level
                        missions of our own country to visit the same countries that had been
                        visited by these Soviet missions? We could show how good we were in this
                        fashion and correct the false impression given by the Soviet visitors.</p>
                    <p>As the final item in his intelligence briefing, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that there were widely
                        confirmed reports that the Soviet Union was trying to use Finland as a lever
                        to create a Scandinavian Federation. The Soviet objective was evidently to
                        get Denmark and Norway out of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> doubted whether this
                        maneuver would attain the objective.</p>

                            <item><p>Many of these tactics are fundamentally political and
                                    psychological. They are the type of tactics which have been used
                                    at home in American politics, but which for many reasons
                                    Americans do not use abroad.</p>

                                            installed without its being done in such a way as to
                                            provoke a wave of gratitude, complete with speeches,
                                            publicity, etc. Yet the former head of United Nations
                                            Technical Assistance in Afghanistan told me that in the
                                            capital, Kabul, the Soviets had won considerable
                                            applause simply by paving the main streets of the city
                                            which for years had irritated everybody because it was
                                            so full of dust in the summer and mud in winter. But the
                                            United Nations and the United States have done work
                                            which was far more sincere and far more constructive
                                            without getting much credit.</item>

                                        <item>Upon arriving in Geneva I was told that the Soviet
                                            representatives at Geneva always give immense tips to
                                            the chambermaids and taxi drivers and that the Soviet
                                            generosity becomes the talk of the town. When I was in
                                            Tripoli, I was told that a member of the Soviet Embassy
                                            in Tripoli pulled two Libyan pounds out of his pocket
                                            and said to his cab driver: “I have two pounds and I
                                            split them with you—one for you and one for me.” These
                                            examples were reported to me as examples of diabolical
                                            Soviet cleverness.</item>

                                meetings, heard so often about our wheat surplus, it was astounding
                                to realize the trouble and delay there has been in sending wheat to
                                Libya. This was partly due to the necessity to get clearances from
                                many different officials in Washington; it was also due to a desire
                                not to send the Libyans so much wheat that they would not start
                                their own wheat-growing program. I think there can be too much of
                                the latter attitude. They are going to have to make their own
                                mistakes and learn by their own experience. If they want a little
                                more wheat than our experts think they should have, I would be for
                                letting them have it, particularly as it would reduce our surplus by

                        predecessors in this work. Some of the issues raised cannot be settled
                        conclusively one way or another. Let me comment briefly on the five points
                        he has made.</p>

                                constructive one, the brief publicity achieved by the flashy project

                                an emergency arises. Examples have been given in the memoranda which
                                I enclose. It must be realized, however, that speed in embarking on
                                an expensive program, or one that involves some substantial policy
                                decision, can frequently do more harm than good.</p>
                            <p>In any organization, particularly government bureaucracy, one must be

                                takes many days, we are always striving to improve our mission
                                personnel so that more discretion and authority can be given to the

                            overhead percentage cost of the international organizations now
                            operating, I wonder whether we want to get into larger multilateral
                            programs under the United Nations unless there is some very definite
                            political advantage.</item>

                        <item>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s statement
                            here is indisputable, but it only covers a part of our program. Many of
                            the countries with which we are dealing achieved their independence a
                            good many years ago, and there is no relationship between our economic
                            aid and this achievement. It would seem to me that the thing to stress
                            is the fact that we have reached great heights through complete freedom
                            of all kinds, that we support it everywhere, and that one thing we have
                            demonstrated is that we are only too anxious not only to free, but to
                            assist countries which through the hazards of war have come under our
                            domination.</item>

                    <p>The two acts of the President in the field of foreign relations which have
                        won the greatest support have been the Atoms for Peace and the “Open Sky”
                        proposals. Both were tremendously effective because they were affirmative,
                        they took the initiative, and they challenged the Soviets, offering to match
                        them in word and deed. My most memorable moment at the United Nations was
                        when I offered the 100 kilograms of fissionable material on behalf of the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>A third step of a similar nature should now be taken. It is:</p>
                    <p>For the President to announce that the United States, believing (a) that
                        underdeveloped countries should be helped, (b) that it is beyond the power
                        of any one country acting alone, and (c) that economic help as a disguise
                        for political penetration is pernicious, offers to join forces with the
                        Soviet Union and other United Nations members and challenges the Soviet
                        Union to match our contributions up to a certain amount to an international
                        fund for economic development. Contributions to be largely in convertible
                        currency (and the non-convertible part to be used to expend our own
                        surpluses).</p>
                    <p>Advantages of such a scheme are: <list>

                                States will come through. We would really capture the initiative and

                    <p>The President asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        if he wished to make an opening statement as to the purposes of the meeting.
                        The Secretary said that he believed it of extreme importance that it should
                        be recognized by everyone that the commission was not constituted for the
                        purpose of making any recommendations for a change in this year’s program.
                        The program now before Congress should be enacted along the lines now
                        presented.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName> said that he had not
                        asked for action from his Committee on his proposal but only that they
                        should think it over. He agreed with the President the members of the
                        commission should be drawn from outside the government and the Congress. It
                        was his thought that they should make a general over-all review of all
                        aspects of our foreign aid program.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary felt that such an investigation should not be so broad as to
                        recommend whether the program should, or should not, be adopted in its
                        entirety but, rather, the ways and means by which the program could be made
                        most effective. He said, for instance, that the commission should not be
                        asked to determine whether there should, or should not, be a military
                        program on Formosa, but, rather, whether it was being done right or could be
                        improved.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out the difficulties inherent in the military problem
                        due to the long-term nature of the expenditures and the necessity for a
                        substantial pipeline. The economic program, on <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76"
                            facs="0108"/>the other hand, could be placed in operation more rapidly
                        after appropriations had been authorized, and therefore a much smaller
                        amount was necessary in the pipeline.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he had envisioned a small group of eminent men,
                        equally divided between both parties. He asked Senator <persName

                        and said they hoped that their services could be obtained. It was
                        anticipated that the report should be available early in 1957.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName> expressed his worry about
                        the effect the establishment of the commission would have on the progress of
                        this year’s Mutual Security Bill. He pointed out that there was a lack of
                        enthusiasm in many areas of Congress and a determined desire on the part of
                        many Senators and Congressmen to see the total amount of the bill cut down
                        substantially. He felt particularly that a substantial cut in military
                        appropriations would be forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary emphasized strongly that such a cut could not be made without
                        seriously imperiling foreign relations and our defense against communism
                        everywhere in the world. He mentioned especially the four year cycle that
                        was required between the time that <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                        submitted its first plans to the Bureau of the Budget, and the final
                        operation in the field.</p>
                    <p>In the general discussion that followed, the President and the Secretary
                        stated the necessity for having the widest possible discretion in the
                        Executive Branch in order that the programs might be successfully adapted to
                        conditions that prevailed at the time of application. Final conditions often
                        could not be envisioned when they were first presented to the Bureau of the
                        Budget and to the Congress. There appeared to be general agreement that
                        maximum possible discretion and flexibility should be given to the
                        Administration in carrying forward the general objectives of the Act.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName> then outlined the
                        practical problems which he felt faced Congress, and the probability that
                        the $4.9 billion request would be cut a billion dollars, most of which would
                        come out of the military proposals as a result of the large backlog which
                        was in the pipeline.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName> then went on to say that
                        on the matter of continuity of the Aid Program, he felt that a general
                        statement should be incorporated in the bill to the effect that as long as
                        the <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0109"/>national security was involved,
                        Congress would continue a foreign aid program.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he wanted just such a statement, and that he thought
                        the one presented by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName> was
                        excellent. He said that we had never wanted anything more specific than
                        that. The President then went on to an extended discussion in which he
                        strongly emphasized the great necessity for the full $4.9 billion
                        appropriation. A general discussion ensued, in which the difficulties before
                        Members of Congress were set forth. The President stated that he would take
                        every possible opportunity to go on record publicly for the Administration’s
                        request before Congress.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the matter of the commission, the President suggested that the
                        Administration would get up a list of individuals who might be suitable for
                        the commission and talk it over again with Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName> and the other Members of Congress
                        who were present. He pointed out that there were many legal problems
                        involved in setting up the commission, not the least of which was the
                        conflict of interest that made it difficult to appoint individuals such as
                        Mr. <persName>Woodruff</persName>. All present were agreed that some method
                        should be found whereby this would not preclude the services of qualified
                        individuals.</p>

                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> indicated in vigorous terms what he
                        believed to be the primary assignment of the Council under his leadership;
                        namely to review and overhaul from stem to stern U.S. foreign economic <pb
                            n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0110"/>policy, including the entire Mutual
                        Security Program. He indicated his belief that our foreign aid program was a
                        heterogenous combination of outmoded activities based in many instances on
                        outmoded policies; that we needed first to define explicitly what was the
                        basic objective of our foreign economic policy which he did not believe was
                        “milk for every Hottentot” but rather military security. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> doubted whether the Chairman meant
                        military security in the narrow sense and suggested that all of our foreign
                        economic policies should be determined on the basis of “what was good for
                        the United States”.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> indicated that he expected
                        during the next few months to talk with anybody who would listen or who
                        believed he had ideas and indicated his intention to visit at least Paris
                        and Tokyo to talk with U.S. representatives at those capitals.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d19fn3"><persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> undertook
                            field trips to Europe in September and to Asia in December 1956; see
                                <ref target="frus1955-57v09#pg_22">vol. IX, pp. 22</ref> ff.</note>
                        He indicated in passing that in his recent conversations in Paris he had
                        been impressed by the unanimous opinion of all Americans he talked to that
                        the United States should follow a more multilateral approach than it had in
                        the past. This did not necessarily mean a United Nations approach.</p>
                    <p>Finally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> indicated that he
                        hoped to be able to organize some sort of a public group to work with him in
                        this field. He was not sure whether he would finally recommend a
                        Presidential Commission or the appointment by <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                            >ICA</gloss> either at his or the President’s request of a group of
                        consultants whom <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> could use as
                        a sounding board for ideas and proposals as he developed them. He expressed
                        his intention to complete this review and revamping by January 1, 1957, and
                        he bespoke the support of the entire committee in getting the job done.</p>
                    <p>With that the meeting adjourned.</p>

                    <p>The Vice President said that as originally planned, his trip was to be
                        confined to the Philippines.<note n="2" xml:id="d20fn2"><persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> visited Vietnam, Thailand,
                            Pakistan, Taiwan, and Turkey as well as the Philippines, where he
                            participated in ceremonies commemorating the 10th anniversary of
                            Philippine independence on July 4. Documentation on the visit is in
                            Department of State, Central File 033.1100–NI.</note> New
                        responsibilities had been gradually added, so that he had ended up with
                        visits to six different countries, each one of which was an ally of the
                        United States receiving U.S. military and economic support.</p>
                    <p>In general, said The Vice President, it seemed to him that as far as these
                        allies were concerned the trip had served a useful purpose. He had talked
                        either to the chief of state or to the chief of government in each of these
                        countries, and in no case had the conversation lasted less than two or three
                        hours. He found that the people of these countries were greatly in need of
                        reassurance as to the attitude of the United States. The current confusion
                        with respect to our position on neutralism had caused a great deal of
                        disruption in these allied states. They had got the idea, except in the case
                        of the Turks, that the United States considered it better for the country to
                        be a neutral than to be an ally of the United States. The Vice President had
                        been able to provide reassurance, he said, on this matter, and the people in
                        these governments had responded well to the reassurance. All of them were
                        good, firm, stout people on the side of the United States. In the future,
                        however, we must bear in mind the absolute necessity for a tough,
                        unequivocal U.S. line which would leave no doubt as to where we stood and
                        where these allies stood in our joint resistance to Communism. Any doubts
                        about this, particularly doubts in Asia, could have a catastrophic effect on
                        the entire U.S. position.</p>
                    <p>Speaking again, he said, on the “plus side”, every single one of the nations
                        that he had just returned from visiting seemed to him stronger economically,
                        politically and militarily than on his earlier visit three years ago. For
                        this happy situation much of the credit was due to the policies which the
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Administration had
                        adopted and carried out.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of the lease of military bases in the Philippines
                        (see <ref target="frus1955-57v22#pg_657">volume XXII, page 657</ref>),
                        Pakistan, and Cyprus (see <ref target="frus1955-57v24#pg_378">volume XXIV,
                            page 378</ref>).]</p>
                    <p>In the remaining portion of his remarks, The Vice President said that he
                        would deal with matters concerning U.S. programs which would be of
                        particular interest to the people around the table. The first of these
                        problems had been particularly well laid out by Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RK1">Karl Rankin</persName> in Taiwan, though the problem he
                        discussed <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0112"/>was common to the whole
                        area and not confined to Taiwan. In essence, Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RK1">Rankin</persName>’s complaint was that we have far too
                        many Americans in Formosa and far too many conflicting programs. It was
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RK1">Rankin</persName>’s conviction that,
                        in addition, all these programs must be coordinated under the Ambassador.
                        The Vice President said he was throwing out this statement for what it might
                        be worth, because the reality of <persName corresp="#p_RK1"
                            >Rankin</persName>’s complaint was borne out by the situation in
                        practically all the other countries he had visited.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that he had
                        brought back the identical impression from his last visit to the Far and
                        Middle East. There were simply too many Americans in all of these countries.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he had
                        been doing his very best to make it clear to the top military man in each
                        foreign country that he must work in closest harmony with the Ambassador.
                        Moreover, added Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, the
                        Defense Department is doing its best to see how many Defense Department
                        officials we can bring back home.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> observed that the
                        criticisms made by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RK1">Rankin</persName>
                        had been made by everyone who goes anywhere to visit our foreign missions.
                        The problem had been with us ever since the new Administration took over. We
                        had been talking about it insistently, and had done nothing.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said he would like to suggest that Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RK1">Rankin</persName>’s report be considered a pilot study.
                        The large number of American officials was a serious problem. All of these
                        oriental countries have their pride. It was probably better to let them do
                        things their own way, even if they were done less effectively than we
                        Americans would do them. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> commented that the best way to get rid of-these
                        excess Americans was to cut off the flow of money so that they couldn’t go
                        to these foreign areas.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said he wished to emphasize one exception to this problem
                        of excessive personnel. The personnel of the Department of State in the
                        areas he visited was in general too scanty. He could not emphasize too much
                        the essentiality of seeing to it that the Ambassador was the boss. After
                        all, the Ambassador must represent the United States in these countries.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that, as it
                        happened, he, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HLW1">Henderson</persName> had had a meeting on this very
                        topic only yesterday. The International Cooperation Administration planners
                        and groups are practically out of control from a policy point of view. Top
                        decisions as to assistance to foreign countries are, of course, made by
                        State Department officers. But the specific programs are handled by <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> personnel in the field, and these latter
                        often refuse to have any dealings whatsoever with the Ambassador. As a
                        result, there is a lot of boondoggling and very little political supervision
                        in the foreign field. We wondered whether <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81"
                            facs="0113"/>we couldn’t put in a rule that no recommendations from
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> personnel in the field could be sent
                        to Washington for decision until these recommendations had been approved by
                        the appropriate U.S. Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said he agreed heartily with this thought of the Secretary
                        of State, and supposed this was why the Administration had determined to put
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> in the State Department. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to state that in
                        any event we must get our house in order, for we are about to undergo a
                        Congressional investigation of all our foreign assistance operations.
                        Accordingly, we must be sure that all of these assistance activities are
                        carefully supervised by our Ambassadors, and that we have eliminated excess
                        personnel, and that our programs are designed to achieve some concrete and
                        useful result and not merely to keep certain people busy in foreign
                        areas.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> again commented that
                        the Administration had been talking about this problem for nearly three
                        years and as yet had not done a damn’ thing about it. The worst influence of
                        all, he believed, came from representatives abroad of the Department of
                        Agriculture. The banks were also troublesome. What we need, therefore, is
                        some kind of a system designed to accomplish our objectives. The Attorney
                        General commented that if we didn’t get such a system we were going to lose
                        our whole foreign assistance program through Congressional hostility.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said he had one more point to make on this subject. The
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> officials repeatedly insisted that
                        they never did anything by way of carrying out programs in these countries
                        unless and until the governments of these countries agreed as to the
                        desirability of these programs. The trouble here, said The Vice President,
                        was that of course any of these foreign governments would agree to almost
                        any program provided the United States paid for it. Instead of this system,
                        it was the Ambassador who ought to talk to the appropriate officials of the
                        foreign government and find out what the country really needed, rather than
                        simply what it was willing to take.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> said that the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> was also beginning to parallel his
                        organization, and that this was going to cause trouble in the future for the
                        Atomic Energy Commission. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PAJ1">Peaslee</persName>
                        commented that on the basis of his own experience as Ambassador, he heartily
                        agreed with the views expressed around the table on this problem.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President then turned to the Secretary of State and asked him
                        whether he did not possess sufficient authority in himself to issue orders
                        which would put an end to this problem. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that he probably did have
                        such authority, but it would be more effective if he could secure <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> or Cabinet backing for the necessary
                        reforms. He added that he would come up in a <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82"
                            facs="0114"/>week or so with concrete proposals for consideration by the
                        National Security Council. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> said that everyone would agree that this was what
                        should be done. Director <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName>
                        added that a practical way to meet this problem would be for the Bureau of
                        the Budget to refuse to provide funds for these programs unless they had
                        received specific State Department approval. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> remarked that Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>, head of the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, was just as unhappy about the situation as
                        he was, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> found it
                        very hard to control his farflung organization.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President pointed out that there are a lot of officials out in the
                        field who have a vested interest in their programs. Some of these were, of
                        course, very competent officials. Others, however, were altogether useless.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed with Director
                            <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> that perhaps the best
                        thing to do was to fix the situation by cutting off the supply of funds.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President then added that on the military side also some of our
                            <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>’s (Military Assistance Advisory
                        Groups) were too big. The military assistance people, as well as the
                        economic assistance people, could profit from a little self-examination.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that there
                        was no question about the truth of this point.</p>
                    <p>In the matter of our aid programs, The Vice President said that he had one
                        other thought. The political effects of our assistance projects were
                        obviously of great importance. Generally speaking, on the economic side The
                        Vice President felt that we should emphasize big “single shot” projects as
                        opposed to scattered or very long-term projects. In general, the impact of
                        the single-shot projects was much greater locally. Of course, however, the
                        choice is one which requires the exercise of judgment.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President added that a particularly bright spot was provided by the
                        much improved job being done by the personnel of <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                            >USIA</gloss>. An exception to this was Thailand. The <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> man there had been there too long and
                        seemed tired. Mr. <persName>Streibert</persName> commented that he was aware
                        of the situation.</p>
                    <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said that as his final observation he would comment on the
                        controversy between Nehru<note n="3" xml:id="d20fn3">Pandit Jawaharlal
                            Nehru, Prime Minister of India.</note> on the one hand and himself and
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> on the other. In
                        this respect, he said, he could not emphasize too strongly that at this time
                        in our history it was extremely important that the United States follow the
                        line which it had long since adopted, and that we not appear to court <pb
                            n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0115"/>neutrals and to abandon our allies.
                        We will not gain in the long run by assuming a servile attitude and glossing
                        over the difference between the Communist world and the free world. Our
                        policies of the last three years have been the right policies, and we should
                        continue to carry them out. If we seem to suggest that we think that the
                        Russians have changed greatly in recent months and that there is now no real
                        danger from Communist imperialism, we should be making a fatal error. On the
                        contrary, this is the time to press even harder rather than to relax. Of
                        course, we should continue to court Prime Minister Nehru and the neutrals
                        rather than let them go down the drain. Nevertheless, we should not hesitate
                        to point out firmly and courteously the difference between accepting
                        assistance from the Communist countries and accepting aid from the United
                        States. If we do not make this clear, our friends will gradually have been
                        nibbled away.</p>

                    <p>58. To Chief of Mission from the President. The President has been concerned
                        over repeated reports that in some countries various United States
                        activities are not being effectively coordinated and evaluated by the Chiefs
                        of Diplomatic Missions. This message relates to that problem.</p>

                    <p>The President is also concerned over reports that in some instances the total
                        number of United States individuals assigned to tasks abroad has become too
                        great. A later message will deal with this and related problems.<note n="2"

                                Executive Order No. 10560. Primary responsibilities for the
                                administration of these programs have been assigned to various
                                United States agencies which maintain direct operating relationships
                                with their representatives abroad. At the country level, however,
                                the Chief of Mission has ultimate responsibility to assure that
                                these program activities are carefully planned and effectively
                                carried out within the framework of established policy, and that
                                they are coordinated with each other. The organizations which are
                                administering these programs at the country level are therefore
                                subject to the supervisory authority of the Chief of Mission in
                                carrying out this responsibility.</item>

                            <item>In discharging his responsibilities the Chief of Mission will need
                                and should have the close collaboration of representatives of all
                                United States agencies. In this connection Section 201(d) of
                                Executive Order No. 10575, which precludes delegation of his
                                functions, should not be interpreted narrowly to obstruct
                                establishment of an effective staff pattern within the country. The
                                ultimate responsibility of the Chief of Mission cannot be delegated,

                            <item>The present U.S. military and economic programs for the six
                                countries which are underway, but in most cases only partially
                                completed will cost the U.S. close to $2 billion yearly through 1960
                                and perhaps $2.5 billion if we responded to requests for enough
                                additional economic development aid to permit a modest strengthening
                                of the economies. If we go ahead on this basis through 1960, the
                                situation at that time would probably not be very much improved. To
                                the extent that inflationary pressures are stimulated, the economic
                                problems may increase. Nothing in the way of a substantial natural
                                tapering off in these expenditures is visible in the foreseeable
                                future.</item>

                            <item>It is clear that the military programs are beyond the capacity of
                                the countries themselves to develop or, with the possible exception
                                of Iran, to maintain. The U.S. has had to cover the build-up costs.
                                In general, we are supporting the budgets and balance of payments of
                                these countries.</item>

                            <item>In spite of the large U.S. assistance, the military establishments
                                constitute a direct and indirect economic burden on the countries
                                (e.g. inflationary pressures and competition for available resources
                                and financing). There are, of course, some compensating economic
                                advantages, e.g. improvement of roads, harbors, etc.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Since a considerable part of U.S. aid goes into budgetary support,
                                rather than into projects to further economic development, the end
                                results of our aid are difficult to control. Reduction of aid in
                                this circumstance becomes extremely difficult and is more
                                susceptible to adverse reactions. If the economic implications of
                                the military build-up are fully realized by the governments
                                concerned, they probably assume in going on with the programs that
                                the U.S. will come to their assistance.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>The studies do not indicate conclusively that the premises on
                                which the programs in these countries were originally based have
                                been modified as a result of changes in conditions (as, for
                                instance, the development of new weapons or the possible
                                modification of Soviet bloc policy). As indicated above, the budget
                                support nature of much of our assistance tends to minimize our
                                control over its use and to make difficult, for instance, a change
                                in emphasis from military support to a relatively greater emphasis
                                on economic development. The programs tend to become increasingly
                                inflexible.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>While the military build-up in the various countries may bring
                                some improvements in line with U.S. security objectives, the real
                                amount of security we are obtaining from the expenditures is
                                difficult to measure precisely. For instance the determination of
                                how many divisions are necessary for certain missions appears to
                                depend largely on subjective judgments. The Committee is in no
                                position to determine whether alternative security arrangements
                                which might cost less are feasible. It is clear, however, that
                                anything approaching major aggression against any of the countries
                                would, now or after the build-up, require substantial and prompt
                                outside assistance.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>Having done what we have and made such commitments as we have,
                                rightly or wrongly, any substantial cut-back on either the military
                                or economic side would be politically very difficult. There is no
                                particular reason to suspect that cut-backs will be less difficult
                                in the future; in fact, the longer we support budgets and balance of
                                payments the greater would seem to be the problem of reducing our
                                aid, since our support will tend to be more and more built into the
                                budgets of these countries as anticipated income.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>Much of the advice and provision of information on which programs
                                are determined and developed comes from field representatives. While
                                they have a role to play in making decisions, the feeling sometimes
                                emerges from the studies that perhaps they may lack the broad
                                perspective needed to provide entirely objective advice.</item>

                    <p>The studies on this group of countries should provide a broader basis on
                        which to make policy decisions than that on which earlier decisions were
                        made and should underline the importance of a coordinated assessment of the
                        implications of such decisions, whether for continuation of present programs
                        or otherwise.</p>

                                economic expenditures in the light of present circumstances.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>It appears, generally speaking, that the U.S. may have participated in the
                        expansion of military plant in these countries beyond a point justified in
                        terms of economic and security considerations. The further we go in this
                        direction the greater are our contingent responsibilities. In this
                        situation, unless more real economic development assistance is forthcoming
                        from somewhere, these economies may experience little or no increase in
                        strength.</p>
                    <p>It appears, therefore, that U.S. policy should look toward a negotiated
                        adjustment downward in military aid. It appears further desirable to
                        accompany this course with greater emphasis on economic development
                        projects. Transferring funds saved from a reduction in military outlays as
                        practicable or politically necessary into well planned economic development
                        would at least be a stimulant toward economic growth. This course, if
                        accompanied by adequate security assurances, may not be entirely unwelcome
                        to these countries. It may offer hope of eventual relief from the heavy
                        burden we now carry, and may also offer the governments of these countries
                        at least some slight hope of economic progress for their people.</p>

                                is marked for your eyes only, because of some frank personal
                                allusions, I have given <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                                    >Hoover</persName> a copy.</p>
                            <p>Although I received my appointment on May 2, 1955, I did not take
                                charge until July 1.</p>
                            <p>In the early weeks of my work although I had a number of meetings
                                with <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>, they were not
                                particularly helpful from the point of view of assisting me to learn
                                my work rapidly. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> had
                                given a great deal of time to public appearances and activities and
                                had left active management to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FGDA1"
                                    >FitzGerald</persName>, except for the short time when <persName

                                to assume active management and, since I wished to understand the
                                whole operation from the bottom up, I spent the entire summer in
                                intensive study. I soon decided that it would be necessary to make a
                                number of visits, and during the year I have taken the following
                                trips: <list>

                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>I have found the work extremely complicated, although not far from
                            what I had imagined. We have something over fifty missions and are
                            operating in some seventy countries with over two thousand different
                            projects. There is a momentum in an operation of this kind which cannot
                            be stopped quickly nor be easily deflected. I had no part in the
                            presentation of the 1956 program, so for the past year I have been
                            operating a program which I had not planned. Some of the prejudices
                            engendered in the Congress during last year’s presentation have plagued
                            us throughout the year, and in this year’s presentation. Even the 1957
                            program, which has just been presented, had been roughly planned before
                            I took over, just as we have now the 1958 program in the rough planning
                            stage. However, as soon as I took over, I made a point of personally
                            reviewing all 1956 programs before approval, even though, naturally,
                            approval was foreordained in many cases.</item>

                        <item>Next to the Department of Defense, this agency has the most difficult
                            operating job in the Government, and it should be conducted by a top
                            executive. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FGDA1">FitzGerald</persName>, while
                            his knowledge of the work is extraordinary, and whose energy is
                            indefatigable and abilities high, is not, in my opinion, an executive. I
                            have been trying from the beginning to find a Chief Deputy of high
                            executive caliber. It is very difficult to get businessmen into this
                            work, which requires a special sort of knowledge. There is, therefore, a
                            tendency to use the same people who have been used in the past,
                            irrespective of their real abilities, simply in the absence of those
                            better qualified to succeed them.</item>

                        <item>This organization is a hard working and devoted group of people, and,
                            in general, loyal. The inability to discharge is unfortunate, but this
                            is a familiar government affliction, and on the whole, I have had little
                            trouble. This organization suffers particularly from the fact that the
                            future is uncertain. The work, if it is to continue for any length of
                            time and be at all efficient, should be on a career basis. It is
                            surprising that it goes as well as it does. I believe that we should
                            attempt next year to get Congress to approve legislation setting up a
                            career service in the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> modeled after
                            the Foreign Service. Ultimately, I believe, they should be integrated,
                            or so arranged that transfer from one to the other would be simple. For
                                <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0122"/>the time being, we have
                            worked out with the Department a consistent standardized pattern
                            governing the salaries of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> Chiefs of
                            Mission in different countries abroad, and their titles and ranks. Prior
                            to this, there had been a hodge-podge of different salaries and titles
                            which had grown up over the years. We now have a complete and
                            sympathetic understanding with the Department on a worldwide basis so
                            that we can avoid reopening these questions each time a Mission Chief is
                            appointed.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item><p>Perhaps this is the time to discuss the present organization, which
                                is the fourth or fifth method of carrying on the foreign aid program
                                which has been adopted. I believe that this operation should be an
                                integral part of the State Department. It is obvious that the
                                enormous influence of the economic program in the political area
                                makes it essential that it should be directed as to policy by the
                                Secretary of State. It failed to work properly under <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> because he was not a team
                                player. Under the new arrangement, as a “semi-autonomous unit,” I do
                                not believe it would work much better unless conducted with the idea
                                of complete team work. As you know, <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                                    >Hoover</persName> and I have consulted regularly, and have
                                ironed out many things at the top before they got mixed up below.
                                The result is that it was very seldom that you were placed in the
                                position of over-ruling a decision of mine. If there had not been
                                this cooperation, you would continually have had to issue orders to
                                me, and busy as you are, this would have meant relying on
                                recommendations of others with little chance for your careful
                                consideration. I think you have been seldom disturbed during the
                                year, but I do believe the present arrangement is organizationally
                                anomalous and, in the long run, impractical.</p>
                            <p>I think the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> should be a branch of
                                the State Department, headed by an Under Secretary for Economic
                                Affairs, who would also have responsibility for all the <gloss
                                    target="#t_E1">E</gloss> area in the Department. Operations
                                proper should be conducted by one Deputy Under Secretary, and other
                                economic matters—perhaps with line authority over all economic
                                officers—should be under another Deputy Under Secretary. I know you
                                dislike taking such operating activities into the State Department,
                                and I am not, of course, urging another early change in an
                                organization which has had so many, but I feel I should tell you
                                what I think is a sound organizational approach.</p></item>

                        <item><p>I have tried to make certain reforms in organization and in

                                Government. I have closed the missions in France, Germany, Norway,
                                Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Austria and Portugal, and I am planning
                                to do the same in England and Italy within the current fiscal year.
                                I met with substantial opposition in this action, and at the earnest
                                request of some of my people, I attempted for a short <pb n="91"

                                missions; but, as I had predicted, this did not work, and we have
                                closed the indicated missions completely. In France, Germany and
                                Austria I have left a few people under the Ambassador to liquidate
                                the fiscal work. I have had fine cooperation from the Ambassadors in
                                taking on the residual <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                                activities in the countries where the missions have been closed,
                                for, of course, there are some unfinished programs from previous
                                years, and we have the problem of programming accumulated local
                                currency. Our new operations in Europe are, therefore, now confined

                            <p>I have established a system for communicating operational policy to
                                all employees. Among other things I have used this system to direct
                                the concentration of our country programs into fewer but more
                                meaningful projects, a greater decentralization of responsibility to
                                the field, etc.</p>
                            <p>Earlier I reported to you I planned a survey of the labor activities
                                of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>. This was made by Dr.
                                    <persName>James A. Morris</persName>, a labor economist on the
                                faculty of the University of South Carolina, and I approved most of
                                the recommendations. I believe that by certain changes in emphasis,
                                and by cooperative efforts with the Department, we can greatly
                                strengthen our labor program at less cost and with complete
                                Government control of its operations. Incidentally, Dr.
                                    <persName>Morris</persName> has now gone to Turkey, as economist

                            <p>I have made great attempts to speed things up and reduce the backlog
                                of work in some countries, which is far too great, partly due <pb
                                    n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0124"/>to cumbersome procedure and
                                lack of adequate pressure in this organization, but in many cases it
                                is due to the difficulty of getting action in countries where
                                businesslike methods are not understood. We have reduced paper work
                                substantially, and I am pushing hard to get the 1957 program under
                                way this summer instead of waiting until the fall, as happened last
                                year. In fiscal 1956, only 15 percent of the year’s program was
                                obligated by December 31, which meant that under existing law, 65
                                percent had to be obligated within the next four months. This was
                                accomplished, but it puts a strain on the organization just at the
                                time the presentation is going forward, and means hasty and
                                ill-considered decisions. You will remember that we tried
                                unsuccessfully to persuade the Congress this year to allow us to
                                postpone 25 percent of the program obligations until October 1,
                                following the close of the fiscal year. I am hoping to get a
                                substantial amount of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957
                                program obligated this fall, and obviate last year’s “bunching up”
                                in the spring. I am also hoping to go forward with the 1958 planning
                                so that the legislation can reach the Congress earlier.
                                Notwithstanding all my efforts, I could not get it started this year
                                before the end of March. This coming year, it will be complicated by
                                the fact that various study groups will be prosecuting their
                                activities, but we should not let this delay us in our own planning,
                                for otherwise, we would never get through.</p>
                            <p>I have become convinced that we have not had adequate technical
                                surveillance over the capital projects which absorb such a large
                                share of our total program funds. I have established a special unit,
                                staffed with competent engineers, who will be able, with the help of
                                private engineering consultation on a contract basis, to maintain
                                technical review and supervision over these projects. Such a unit
                                should insure that major projects are economically and technically
                                sound before large investments of U.S. funds are committed to them.
                                I am sure this action will net us significant savings of program
                                funds. I have also established a contracting office to supervise our
                                vast contracting activities.</p></item>

                        <item><p>I have tried to eliminate proliferation, and have issued
                                instructions to try to reduce the number of projects by about 20
                                percent. This is particularly applicable to technical assistance
                                where there is a tendency to develop new projects without completing
                                the old. I feel that a few well-planned and executed programs are a
                                great deal better than a number of less effective ones. In this
                                connection, we must realize that many of our projects going forward
                                today were committed from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 and
                                even earlier funds, so my efforts will not be effective for some
                                time. This is why the cuts made in our requests for administration
                                funds are unfortunate, for it needs good administration to taper off
                                and close out the less valuable programs.</p>
                            <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0125"/>
                            <p>I think you know of my attempt to reduce the activities in the
                                dependent overseas territories, knowing that our funds are limited.
                                Unless we stop somewhere, we cannot take on the newer obligations
                                which the changing world requires.</p>
                            <p>You will recall that in my last report I told you I was considering
                                whether our procurement should be world-wide, or, in certain cases,
                                limited to U.S. sources. A draft policy on this subject was
                                presented to the Council on Foreign Economic Policy, which approved
                                my recommendation that all procurement be on a free-world basis.
                                This has been made a part of our operating policy. In this
                                connection, as soon as I took charge I terminated the special coal
                                buying program which <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>
                                had started, as it seemed unsound in theory and the coal situation
                                had substantially eased.</p></item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>One of our major working and administrative problems, little
                            understood outside of this organization, lies in the requirements to be
                            met in planning and negotiating a country program. A whole year’s
                            program must generally be planned with a country as a “package” deal.
                            This makes it difficult to set aside adequate reserves for emergencies,
                            the total of which, for proper administration, should be substantially
                            in excess of the emergency funds granted by the Congress. When the
                            presentation is made to the Congress, the country involved knows what is
                            programmed for it, and although conditions in the world may change
                            materially, it is hard to take anything away from what a country
                            considers belongs to it. It would be much easier if we could make a base
                            deal with a country for a smaller amount than what we really expect
                            ultimately to give it, and then step this amount up later in the year if
                            funds are available. Additional requirements lie in the fact that we
                            must reach a certain total of agricultural commodities, must consider
                            the problems of loans against grants, the problem of <gloss
                                target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 sales, the problem of commodity
                            shipments, direct budget support, the engendering of local currency for
                            defense activities, and so forth.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>This brings me to the question of cooperative planning with the State
                            Department. Unfortunately, with the exception of you and <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>, there is no one in the
                            Department with an over-all view of the world’s requirements. Neither of
                            you has the time to study the whole operating scene. I am, therefore,
                            subject to the most extraordinary pressures from the regional heads and
                            desk men at the State Department, often pushed by the ambassadors, to
                            undertake new projects or speed old ones. While my own organization is
                            equally inclined to support such requests, I am in a position to
                            regulate them, which I cannot do in the State Department. I am therefore
                            continually fighting a battle to hold down the individual country
                            requests so that I can keep within the available totals and retain funds
                            for last minute emergencies. Almost all projects have merit, <pb n="94"
                                xml:id="pg_94" facs="0126"/>but there must obviously be relative
                            priority, and I am in the difficult position of having to settle this
                            without much help.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item><p>I would suggest that on the State Department side there be a
                                greater recognition of the machinery necessary to put a program into
                                operation. There is a tendency on the political or “idea” side to
                                feel that a decision can be implemented immediately. This brings
                                about, frequently, a demand for action that results in hasty and
                                ill-timed programs. Perhaps I should set up a special emergency
                                relief fund to cover these calls for aid. We do not get enough
                                advance notice of the intentions of the State Department. A
                                programming study should be made before a tentative approach is made
                                to a country. Instead, a round figure is often picked out of the air
                                by the State Department on the basis of what surrounding countries
                                are getting, or what it might take to make said country politically
                                happy, without consideration of exactly what the country’s most
                                important economic needs are or its ability to assimilate such
                                dollar aid. We should not say, “We will give you xxx million
                                dollars,” but, “We will help you in the following program.” Ceylon
                                and Burma are perhaps examples of this. It would seem that the
                                Policy Planning Staff should call us in from the very beginning.</p>
                            <p>The problem of advance planning is also applicable to certain
                                international agency operations. For instance, we were asked
                                suddenly last spring to send a high-ranking man to Tehran just prior
                                to the Baghdad Pact meeting.<note n="8" xml:id="d23fn8">The meeting
                                    was held April 16–19 in Tehran under the presidency of Iran’s
                                    Premier, Husayn Ala. The Baghdad Pact, signed February 24, 1955,
                                    between Turkey and Iraq, contained provisions pledging mutual
                                    cooperation in defense, noninterference in the internal affairs
                                    of the other party, and peaceful settlement of disputes. The

                                    signatory.</note> I sent my head of operations for that region
                                out on twenty-four hours’ notice, and since <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGV1">George Allen</persName> had not yet arrived,
                                Seager had to hold the fort for several days in difficult
                                discussions for which, of course, he was inadequately briefed. It
                                would seem that a situation of this kind could be anticipated and
                                planned for. My own experience in taking over as chief of the
                                delegation at the Colombo Meeting last fall was something the same.
                                While the advance work of our representatives there had been done
                                intelligently, the United States’ position had not been
                                well-developed, and the whole meeting evidenced inadequate planning
                                on the part of the United States. It would seem that wherever
                                economic matters are involved in international affairs, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> should be called in early in the
                                game for whatever contribution it may make in the way of
                                information, study or personnel. This is recognized in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>, where <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                                    >ICA</gloss> takes the leading part, but it would seem
                                applicable <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0127"/>to a lesser degree
                                with respect to the Colombo group, the Baghdad Pact, and even for
                                organizations such as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                                    <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>Disaster aid is another area which needs organizational study. It
                                cost the United States a million and a half dollars for emergency
                                action in Italy last winter because the Ambassador called for help,
                                the Administration responded, and the Army was called into
                                action—all without advance checking with this organization, which
                                was expected to foot the bill. We could have acted just as quickly
                                at considerably less cost. I believe some machinery should be set up
                                to clear all emergency requests, and that certain criteria should be
                                established. Otherwise, we become a kind of International Red Cross,
                                and the aid given is somewhat hit or miss.</p></item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>The whole question of the function of the head of <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> requires further study. He is supposed
                            to coordinate the whole Mutual Security Program, but how can he
                            coordinate adequately unless his office assists in planning from the
                            very beginning? Otherwise, he is nothing but an operator, subject to
                            orders. My experience at <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meetings
                            has indicated the need for further review of this question. At present,
                            I go to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meetings whenever I believe
                            matters may come up which affect the <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                            >ICA</gloss>. However, particularly in the last few months, matters
                            affecting <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> very importantly have come
                            up and have been fully discussed and decisions made when I was not
                            present simply because the agenda did not indicate what might develop.
                            You, or your representative, are, of course, always there, but it is
                            almost impossible to keep you or him fully informed of all the matters
                            of operations in the seventy countries which are vitally affected by
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> discussions and conclusions.
                            Here again, proper organization should require regular representation of
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> if its head is to be more than
                            one who executes orders. I say all this impersonally, to help out
                            whoever may be my successor. My connections and my year’s experience are
                            such that I can keep pretty well abreast of what is going on. It would
                            be extraordinarily difficult for a successor to me to step immediately
                            into a corresponding position without having at least a year of
                            experience, unless there is a change organizationally.</item>

                                largely of a short study and a few discussions when a year’s program
                                is laid down in the rough, and then a check as the work goes forward

                                justified. There is very little opportunity to influence the

                                of different levels of military effort, but there should be some

                        <item><p>Another function which needs clarification even more is that of the
                                presentation to the Congress. While it has been delegated to the
                                head of the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, he cannot exercise
                                it properly under the present setup. I appointed a top man to
                                conduct the presentation, which he did with energy and ability, but
                                on a number of occasions the decision of who should be witnesses and
                                what they should present was taken out of his hands. This was partly
                                the fault of some of the State Department and Defense Department
                                people who had their own theories of the proper approach to the
                                Congressional committees, but one of the most important failures was
                                adequate political liaison, so important in a matter of this kind.
                                Let me mention a few of the incidents which may have materially
                                affected the results: <list>
                                    <label>a.</label>
                                    <item>You will remember that in December, 1955, a satisfactory
                                        presentation of the proposed Mutual Security Program was
                                        made at Camp <persName>David</persName>. Later, when the
                                        same presentation was made at the White House to the
                                        Congressional leaders of both parties, I was informed that
                                        the military part of the Mutual Security Program would be
                                        handled by the Secretary of Defense, rather than as part of
                                        a unified picture as presented at Camp
                                            <persName>David</persName>, which the members of
                                        Congress had been led by custom to expect. The result was a
                                        complete misunderstanding of the increase in size of the
                                        military side of the Mutual Security Program, which plagued
                                        us throughout the whole Congressional session. It would seem
                                        that these informal advance presentations, not only in the

                                    <item>There was, throughout the early days of the hearings,
                                        great emphasis on the influence of Senator <persName

                                        This the latter resented, and I am certain the action of the

                                    <item>Again, when the leaders of both sides of the House were
                                        called to the White House just as the bill was coming to the
                                        floor, the Speaker, the Majority and the Minority Leaders
                                        all stated several times that the meeting should have been
                                        called a few days earlier, before the issue was crystallized
                                        and the Committee had made its report. <persName

                                        remember, stated that he could not ask his Committee to go
                                        back on the action they had just taken, and when he went on
                                        the floor the next day, the issue in the minds of many
                                        members of the House was the support of a popular colleague
                                        against the steamroller of the leaders. This could have been
                                        obviated.</item>

                            <p>Somebody has to head up matters of this kind. If the Director of the

                                presentation, it would seem to me that he should direct all
                                activities in connection with it. Perhaps it should be done at the
                                White House, and perhaps it should be done in the State Department,
                                but it ought to be done somewhere.</p></item>

                        <item>This leads into the whole question of publicity, which is an integral
                            part of the presentation. The Mutual Security Program is a highly
                            complicated subject on which few people have full information. It would
                            seem to me that whenever the subject is to be discussed by a leading
                            Administration figure, there should be proper staffing ahead of time. An
                            example of the neglect of this was the President’s Baylor speech.<note

                        <item>I have given much thought to the place of atomic energy in our work.
                            This subject is difficult to fit into the Mutual Security Program
                            because of its strong political aspects, its security requirements and
                            its connection with the President’s “Atoms for Peace” policy. Obviously,
                            the power aspects of the problem, which loom larger every day, are of
                            paramount importance in planning the economic future of a country, which
                            is essentially an <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> responsibility.
                            The whole problem is not well understood in most foreign countries, and
                            the liaison and coordination between our procurement departments have
                            been inadequate. I believe that assistance to our <pb n="98"
                                xml:id="pg_98" facs="0130"/>friends in developing energy from atomic
                            sources should be handled exactly as energy from other sources,
                            provided, of course, that security regulations are adequate. I believe
                            also that training of atomic experts should also be handled as training
                            of experts in other fields. The State Department should, of course,
                            maintain its policy direction, and the Atomic Energy Commission should
                            control fuel and information, and give technical advice.</item>

                        <item>I have tried to turn certain activities of this organization over to
                            other departments. It seemed to me improper that the work with escapees
                            and refugees should be divided, so that part of this work carried on in
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> has been consolidated with the
                            work in this and the immigration field in the State Department. I
                            believe that for fiscal year 1958 the appropriations for these
                            activities should be through the State Department appropriation bill.
                            These activities have nothing to do with economics, and are essentially
                            political.</item>
                        <label>17.</label>
                        <item>I have tried to transfer the investment guaranty program to the
                            Export-Import Bank. While this work is of economic significance in that
                            it is influential in persuading private capital in this country to move
                            into foreign fields, its machinery is more of a banking nature, and
                            since the Export-Import Bank handles the mechanics of all our loans and
                            is in the lending field itself, this work seemed to fall naturally
                            within its jurisdiction. Although I had an agreement with <persName
                                corresp="#p_WSC1">Sam Waugh</persName> to take this over, he later
                            changed his mind because he thought it might involve the sterilization
                            of some of his lending power in order to supply reserves for this
                            insurance. I am unable to accomplish this now because the Congress
                            specifically instructed the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> to
                            continue to administer this program.</item>
                        <label>18.</label>
                        <item><p>This brings me to a most important subject, which is the better use
                                of the great amounts we are spending so that we may stimulate
                                private investment as much as possible rather than to continue to
                                make advances or grants to governments. The latter course tends to
                                socialize the countries we are trying to help, and offers temptation
                                to those in control of the government to participate in state-owned
                                capital investment to their own advantage. This organization, under
                                the present setup, can hardly lend to private interests, foreign or
                                American, the dollar funds appropriated for it. We can, however,
                                make available to lending organizations in the countries we are
                                helping certain dollar amounts which will, in turn, be lent by them
                                to private industry, subject to our specific or general approval.
                                This is being done successfully in the Philippines, India, and other
                                countries. We can also make available substantial amounts of local
                                currency, the use of which is under our partial control, for lending
                                to private interests which are willing to invest dollars or other
                                foreign exchange in the country in question. We are discussing <pb
                                    n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0131"/>this with the Export-Import
                                Bank, and are negotiating with several American companies for
                                projects to be financed in this way.</p>
                            <p>We must press continually for legislation in the countries in which
                                we work to improve the climate for foreign private capital. While
                                this activity is supposed to be part of the <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                                    >ICA</gloss> work, it has always seemed to me to be essentially
                                a function of the embassy proper. I do not believe this is
                                adequately impressed on Ambassadors, from what some of them have
                                told me.</p></item>
                        <label>19.</label>
                        <item>This brings us to the question of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            480, the operations of which have made available so much local currency.
                            Operations under Title I of this law need clarification and decision as
                            to ultimate goal. The tendency has been to make a sale and let the
                            question of the use of the proceeds be thrashed out later, whereas I
                            believe the proper procedure is to have the whole question of the use of
                            the proceeds settled at the time the sale agreement is made. The
                            Department of Agriculture is always pushing for the acceptance of any
                            transaction which will help eliminate the most troublesome of the
                            surpluses, and there is a tendency on the part of the State Department
                            representatives to approve a deal which is politically attractive to the
                            country involved. If, as in the great majority of cases, the country
                            involved wishes to borrow the sales proceeds for the purpose of its own
                            industrial development, the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> should
                            have the responsibility of planning this development in order that the
                            economic status of the country involved can be best improved. The <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> should, therefore, have a most
                            important part in the planning of these sales from the very beginning so
                            that there will be adequate consideration of this principle. Frequently,
                            the size of the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 program dwarfs
                            completely the ordinary economic operations in a country, and this
                            raises organizational questions. In Chile, for instance, an <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> organization set up for the purpose of
                            conducting a $1.5 million technical assistance program is obviously
                            inadequate to plan and police a $5 million <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                >PL</gloss> 480 development program which has resulted from the
                            sales agreement of January 27, 1955. With the new authorization of $1.5
                            billion for Title I sales, it is probable that there will be more than
                            $1 billion worth of foreign currencies owned by the United States within
                            the next year or so. The planning of the use of these funds not only
                            becomes a major operation, but we should be considering what will happen
                            in the future when interest and amortization begin, and final payments
                            are ultimately made. I have named a special staff assistant for
                            financial matters to oversee our guaranty and lending functions.</item>
                        <label>20.</label>
                        <item>When it comes to this over-all planning, we must think through what
                            will happen to our Mutual Security Program if, as is probable, in the
                            not too distant future, we have a year of substantial business
                            recession, with a certain amount of unemployment, and <pb n="100"
                                xml:id="pg_100" facs="0132"/>there arises perhaps a need for
                            internal government aid of one kind or another. Securing appropriations
                            for foreign aid will be most difficult. We must try to work out some way
                            of establishing reserves for our most important programs to tide things
                            over such a year, or years. We must insist on countries doing all they
                            can to help themselves, and doing it now instead of waiting until the
                            time it will be forced on them. Otherwise, there results not only the
                            highly dangerous situation of a country loaded down with a program it
                            cannot continue, but the complete loss of friendship with that country
                            because it will feel we have let it down.</item>

                        <item>I know how much you are interested in the question of what portion of
                            our program should be in loans. There is obviously great pressure from
                            Congress to put all development assistance on a loan basis. Until
                            something can be done to work out the idea you have sometimes stated of
                            making a loan conditioned on the relative future recovery of the
                            borrower, I think we should make more loans of economic developments
                            funds even though the loans are “fuzzy”.<note n="11" xml:id="d23fn11"
                                >“Fuzzy” loans were generally understood to be loans extended to
                                borrowing nations on easier terms and at greater risk of default

                        <item><p>We must face the problem of handling the various review boards
                                which have been or are about to be appointed. The Senate Foreign
                                Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee have set
                                up review boards, and the House Appropriations Committee may do the
                                same. The President is considering appointing his own committee,
                                while there is already in existence the Presidentially-appointed
                                committee of which <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric
                                    Johnston</persName> is Chairman, and which is supposed to advise
                                him and me on international development. I have created a new
                                Evaluation Staff in my office, to be composed of four teams of two
                                members each. The team members will be senior, experienced
                                personnel, one with <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> experience,
                                and the other, to be detailed from the State Department, with strong
                                economic background. This staff will provide me with objective
                                evaluations of program objectives, content, and operating
                                effectiveness, based on actual on-the-site review of operations.
                                They will spend about three months visiting missions, followed by
                                one month in Washington. This should provide us with an evaluation
                                of each country program approximately every two years.</p>

                                of the program. In this connection, I believe that Bill Rand would
                                be an excellent appointee.</p>
                            <p>As far as study results are concerned, I cannot see how there can be
                                an established policy in this work any more than in yours. While the
                                welfare of the United States must be our general goal, a program of
                                value in one country is poison in another. We must act quickly in
                                some emergencies, and in others, wait for the smoke to dissipate. I
                                cannot go along with those who believe in spending taxpayers’ money
                                out of pure philanthropy. We can be generous in a real emergency
                                because we are that kind of people, but most of the work in these
                                lines should be left to private charity, and our actual relief aid
                                should be short-term and limited in amount. Furthermore, we must
                                plan to finish programs. If we never get out of a country and
                                continue to take on new ones, such as Morocco, Tunisia and Sudan, we
                                will be stretched too thin for our resources.</p>
                            <p>We must soon give much thought to the coming legislation, not only in
                                concept, but in format. I have about concluded that the whole Mutual
                                Security Act should be rewritten and brought up to date. At present
                                it is a most difficult piece of legislation to understand, with its
                                amendments, exceptions, arbitrary regulations, and outmoded
                                definitions. I realize that the leading members of the Congressional
                                committees and the committee staffs have become used to it in its
                                present form, but if we consult them fully, and receive White House
                                backing in a new Congress, we may be able to get the desired
                                results.</p>
                            <p>The question of tying the military part of the Mutual Security
                                Program in with the Defense Department legislation must be carefully
                                studied. Many members of Congress have urged this, and it has the
                                advantage of showing this country that much so-called “foreign aid”
                                is actually defense expenditure. If this is done, we might even want
                                to include that part of the non-military program which backs up the
                                military effort in countries like Korea, Taiwan and Viet-Nam, which
                                would mean that we would shrink the program of economic aid, from
                                which the military aspect is largely withdrawn, to a few hundred
                                millions.</p>
                            <p>I realize that the results of the various studies which are
                                contemplated may well require other drastic legislative changes, but
                                that should not prevent our own immediate review of what I have
                                discussed in this paragraph.</p></item>

                        <item>I hope this report doesn’t sound like a general complaint. I know that
                            many of the things I have touched on cannot be changed quickly, if at
                            all. All government is inefficient, and this great sprawling bureaucracy
                            of 8,000 people sprinkled all around the world, engaged in everything
                            from building power plants and eliminating malaria to teaching teachers
                            to teach, is very inefficient and <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102"
                                facs="0134"/>wasteful. I took this work on with no illusions. It is
                            the most interesting I have ever been in, and the most rewarding in
                            itself. I have enjoyed particularly working with you, and have
                            appreciated your continuous courtesy and understanding of my problems. I
                            have bothered you as little as possible, for I know the crushing burdens
                            under which you labor. The chief thing I regret is that I have so far
                            been unable to find a Chief Deputy. I am still looking for a top
                            executive of prestige to come in, first in the operating field, and
                            then, little by little, to take over the work so that I can suggest to
                            you and the President that my Deputy succeed me, and I can go back to
                            running a law office.</item>

                                neutrals whose major concerns are economic and social, not
                                military?</p>

                                questionable whether the concept of “mutual security” which seemed
                                so appropriate for Western Europe several years ago is appropriate
                                in 1956. At that time the dominant motivating factor was fear of
                                aggression by Russia. Today <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0135"
                                />many countries on the periphery of the Soviet bloc prefer to be
                                neutral in the best sense of the word but would welcome aid from the
                                U.S. If such countries did not have to “take sides” in order to
                                qualify, the program would be more palatable psychologically and the
                                Soviet bloc would lose a propaganda target in that future U.S. aid
                                would be more positively slanted toward peace rather than
                                preparation for war. If we moved away from the concept of mutual
                                security and toward a concept of helping others help themselves to
                                achieve economic and social objectives, then presumably we should
                                have a somewhat less formal linkage between military assistance and
                                other forms of U.S. aid. On the other hand, there is still a lot of
                                sentiment within the Executive branch and in Congress to the effect
                                that “if you are not for us you are against us”. In other words, we
                                would restrict our aid largely to those who are willing to stand up
                                and be counted on our side.</p></item>

                                discussion lately within the Executive branch of the alleged fact

                                is also continuing objection to legislative provisions with regard

                                U.S. officials emphasize that in fact Soviet agreements reached with
                                countries around the rim of the Iron Curtain seem to have very
                                specific terms. In addition some of the alleged assistance that the
                                Soviets were supposed to have promised on very liberal terms, such
                                as the Aswan High Dam,<note n="5" xml:id="d24fn5">Project conceived

                                the present mutual security legislation does include substantial
                                sums which are not subject to normal legislative restrictions.
                                Finally it should be emphasized that a growing number of U.S.
                                officials feel that we have been much too loose in our making of
                                political commitments for aid around the world.</p></item>

                                U.S. aid has been used very freely as a “bribe” in order to persuade
                                a country to vote on our side, to adopt sound but unpalatable
                                internal economic reforms, or to counter Russian offers of economic
                                assistance. As one reflection of such a policy, foreign officials in
                                friendly countries frequently assert that the best way to get large
                                amounts of U.S. assistance is to have a good internal communist
                                scare, threaten to accept aid from the Soviet bloc, or fail to

                                economic problems with the understanding that when these economic
                                problems are solved the aid will stop. Is this trend a desirable
                                one; i.e. should we in fact look upon economic assistance as a
                                political weapon?</p></item>

                                developed on the assumption that at the end of four years we would
                                “turn off the tap”. Such a policy laid down at the start of the
                                program permitted forward planning with more assurance; it also
                                caused the other countries involved to plan their part of the mutual
                                effort so they would be ready to carry on alone at the end of four
                                years. This plan was, of course, interrupted by the Korean war and
                                the development of a military assistance program in Western Europe.
                                Since that time, however, there has not been built into our aid
                                programs a policy of phasing out an aid program in a country at a

                                their own defense expenditures, or are making little or no attempt
                                to increase their defense effort commensurate with their economic
                                capacity. We usually continue to provide military aid long after
                                economic aid is discontinued—in many cases without regard to
                                economic ability to pay. Some small starts have been made towards
                                reducing or eliminating this aid but they have been made difficult
                                because of (1) the political consideration that we shouldn’t cut off
                                aid to any member <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0137"/>of the

                                use of military aid as a tool in negotiation for base rights; (4)
                                the lack of a firm U.S. policy on providing “new weapons” (atomic
                                and otherwise); and (5) the lack of an agreed-upon measuring stick
                                for “economic capacity”.</p></item>

                            >ICA</gloss>. In January 1956 Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OJH1"
                            >Ohly</persName> proceeded to develop working relationships with

                    <p>It soon became apparent that the implementation of 1290–d in its broader
                        sense involved many activities of all of the major agencies of the U.S.
                        government operating overseas. Of course these agencies have many other
                        purposes than simply the preservation of internal security, and it becomes
                        difficult to deal with the isolated problem with which Action 1486–c is
                        concerned. It is also clear that there is not a simple, separately
                        identifiable 1290–d program but rather a mixture of a great variety of
                        things which, in some cases directly and in other cases only very indirectly
                        are likely to make some contribution toward the improvement of internal
                        security in another country.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Organizational Problem</hi></p>
                    <p>The above problem called for the development of special procedures and
                        mechanisms for inter-agency coordination under, to some degree, central
                        direction. The <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> working groups for each
                        country carry out certain responsibilities, but cannot perform adequately
                        the necessary program planning, evaluation and reporting as well as the
                        day-to-day resolution of conflicts, and general supervision. While the major
                        organizational and leadership problem is as yet unresolved, interagency
                        matters are being handled on an ad hoc basis with some success. Until

                                of a 1290–d program, agreement must be secured between the host
                                government and the United States concerning the nature and extent of
                                the activities to be undertaken cooperatively. This usually involves
                                both political and technical negotiations, which may require
                                substantial time. Most of these delays are inherent in the
                                governmental processes and internal problems of the host country.
                                They sometimes also relate to the relative priority which the
                                American Ambassador attributes to the 1290–d program and to other
                                important negotiations which may be simultaneously involved in the
                                relationship between the U.S. and the host country. Once the top
                                political agreements are reached, technical negotiations usually

                    <p>In September 1955, during the earlier <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>
                        discussions of what subsequently became Action 1290–d, <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> established a Civil Police Branch in its
                        Public Administration Division. With the approval of 1290–d this Branch was
                        elevated to Divisional status and its staff substantially expanded.
                        Organizationally, the Civil Police Division, which has a staffing pattern of
                        19 positions, has the same organizational status as the <gloss

                            may be called “personal diplomacy” and requires that the Ambassador and
                            his assistants take advantage of every opportunity to persuade foreign
                            officials in 1290–d countries of the necessity and desirability of their

                            recommendations in the 1290–d papers. Examples of this are (a)

                                to get to Washington from the field. This delay is being met by
                                using lower classifications when possible for communications other
                                than cables. There have been delays arising out of difficulties in

                        <item>The Agency is conducting information activities designed to increase

                            officials. The Agency is also handicapped in Cambodia by the
                            government’s neutrality policy. In Iran, however, the Agency has the
                            cooperation of the Iranians in a rather extensive special program for
                            indoctrination of the Armed Forces, using films, local military radio,
                            and printed matter. In Japan the Agency’s entire regular program is
                            heavily keyed to the 1290–d objective of countering communist influence
                            among intellectuals and labor. A vigorous but discreet campaign to
                            promote 1290–d objectives is underway in Iceland.</item>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that the problem of
                        foreign aid was far and away the most important single aspect of our foreign
                        policy. That policy was designed to meet the threat derived from the Soviet
                        rulers who hoped to gain such a great power advantage that it would enable
                        them to defeat the United States in battle, if necessary, or, far more
                        desirable, cause the United States to surrender without a struggle because a
                        struggle appeared to be futile. The tactics the Russians hoped to use were
                        similar to those employed by chess players. The aim of a chess game is for
                        one of the players to take his opponent’s king. Once he has announced
                        “checkmate”, the king is his without the necessity for completing the
                        remaining plays. Russia hopes to gain a position of such superiority that
                        war won’t be necessary.</p>
                    <p>Our present foreign policy is designed to prevent three things. It is
                        designed to deter an atomic attack. The United States is subject to direct
                        atomic attack and must have the retaliatory capacity to carry destruction to
                        a would-be attacker. Our foreign policy is also designed to check the Soviet
                        bloc’s enlargement of its area of dominion. An increasing expansion of its
                        area would cause an increasing risk for us since the bloc would gain
                        additional manpower and materials as well as strategic locations. The
                        expansion of the Soviet bloc has gone as far as can be tolerated. Finally,
                        our foreign policy is designed to break up the present Soviet bloc because
                        in the long run a purely defensive role never succeeds. We are trying to
                        force the Russian rulers to concentrate on their own problems; we’re giving
                        them some homework to do. Our so-called foreign aid program, which is really
                        not foreign aid because it isn’t aid to foreigners but aid to us, is an
                        indispensable factor in carrying out our foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>The effectiveness of our deterrent power against atomic attack is dependent
                        upon our bases around the world. Russia can launch attacks upon the vital
                        parts of our nation from its own shores, but we can’t launch attacks upon
                        the vital parts of Russia from our shores. The distance the United States
                        would have to cover is almost twice as great as that which Russia would have
                        to cover. We must, therefore, have bases to give us propinquity to Russia.
                        In addition, <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0151"/>we must have bases to
                        give us diversification, so that if one launching area were wiped out by an
                        initial assault, we would still have other areas from which to operate. We
                        have to remember that those countries which let us have bases are taking a
                        considerable risk.</p>
                    <p>The Sino-Soviet bloc has been expanding apace since 1945. The number of
                        people under its rule has increased from 250 million people to 800 million.
                        The culmination of the expansion of the Sino-Soviet bloc came with the
                        attack on Korea. The mutual security system which has come into being as a
                        result of that expansion provides, in effect, that the parties pledged to it
                        will stand together in event of attack, so that they won’t be picked off one
                        by one. We have bilateral and multilateral treaties with 42 countries, and
                        the Baghdad Pact brings us in close relationship with two more. From a
                        military as well as a political view, however, a mere pledge is not
                        sufficient; it must be reinforced by forces in being. Originally, the
                        peoples of the world did not feel this way, but the Korean situation changed
                        their attitude. Today we must meet the fears of the people of other
                        countries. It is not enough to have liberated them; it is necessary that we
                        give them protection. To do this we must have forces in being sufficient to
                        deter or at least hold back attack. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is
                        that type of force. We must also have forces to ensure internal stability
                        and make costly outside attack.</p>
                    <p>Our total annual expenditure on security has been about $40 billion annually.
                        Of that approximately ten per cent, or $4 billion has gone for aid. Of that
                        about 85 per cent has been used to assist economically and financially
                        burdened countries in the maintenance of military establishments and in
                        defense support. In Europe at present aid for defense support is
                        insignificant. What little is being given goes primarily to Spain and
                        Yugoslavia. In Spain we have the problem of bases which serve as an
                        alternative to those in North Africa. In Spain we are giving both military
                        and economic aid. We have worked a long time in Yugoslavia to prevent Soviet
                        expansion there. Now that the Soviets are making an economic thrust there,
                        we must keep our hand in because Yugoslavia provides a notable example of
                        national independence in Eastern Europe. Our program in Europe including
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> amounts to about $1 billion for
                        the coming year.</p>
                    <p>In the coming year we expect to spend $700 million in the Middle East. That
                        area includes the nations running from Turkey through Pakistan. To Turkey
                        and Pakistan we are giving primarily military and defense support aid.
                        Through the Baghdad Pact we have ties with Iraq and Iran, though we are not
                        members of the Pact. Iran which we rescued from the Communist Tudeh party
                        probably will not be a permanent burden to us. Turkey is about the <pb
                            n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0152"/>most dependable ally that we have
                        in the world today. In both Turkey and Pakistan, however, there are economic
                        problems to be solved which result partially from the fact that our military
                        experts believe it is necessary for both countries to have military
                        establishments considerably larger than their economies can support.</p>
                    <p>Our toughest problems are in the Far East. In that area we have disconnected
                        peninsular and island positions in which we are interested ranging from
                        Korea, Japan, Okinawa (the defensive position there is ours entirely),
                        Taiwan, and the Philippines through Southeast Asia. We have a collective
                        security arrangement for that particular area under <gloss
                            target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. In the Far East generally, we are
                        spending about $1.6 billion. Japan is carrying most of the burden of its
                        military establishments.</p>
                    <p>Communist China is still building up her forces and still following the
                        Stalinist policy of the use of force. There have been frequent violations of
                        the Korean armistice, and there are continued threats to take Formosa by
                        force. The Vietminh forces<note n="2" xml:id="d26fn2">Vietnamese Communist
                            forces under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh.</note> are being built up.
                        All of these areas have either recently been zones of hostility or threaten
                        to become so.</p>
                    <p>The problem of defending the areas in which we are interested is very
                        difficult. It can be said that defense of them could and should be managed
                        on a cheaper basis. Some say that we don’t need so many troops in Korea,
                        that our air bases on Okinawa are sufficient to defend Korea. We have to
                        remember, however, that we have a psychological problem, that of morale, to
                        face. The South Koreans live in an area which has already been devastated.
                        If they thought that the United States was abandoning them, they would
                        collapse and could then be taken over internally. We sometimes have to do
                        things that are apparently not rational, bearing in mind the impact of what
                        we do on the people concerned.</p>
                    <p>In answering the question, are the things we’re doing in the Far East worth
                        the money that we’re spending on them, we must remember that there would be
                        disaster if the western Pacific fell into hostile hands. In developing our
                        foreign policy we enunciated in the Monroe Doctrine our stand against
                        expansion by other countries into the Western hemisphere. Later we found it
                        necessary to extend that policy against expansion when we discovered that we
                        couldn’t afford to have the Atlantic Ocean dominated and then more recently
                        the Pacific Ocean. Imagine what it would be like if we couldn’t hold Japan,
                        for then surely Korea and Formosa would slide into the Communist orbit.
                        Gradually expenses in Korea can be brought down, but the will to resist must
                        be retained.</p>
                    <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0153"/>
                    <p>So far all but about $600 million worth of foreign aid has been accounted
                        for. $400 million of what remains is straight economic aid for countries
                        with whom we have no security arrangements such as India and Indonesia.
                        India is the largest, non-captured, non-Communist country in the Far East.
                        Nehru is conducting a strong effort to prevent the country from going
                        Communist, though some of the trends in India are socialistic. We are giving
                        her between $50 to $60 million this year. Indonesia is in a rather desperate
                        economic position, and we can’t let her fall by the wayside because if we
                        did our communication line between Japan and Australia would be cut. $200
                        million is going to Indonesia.</p>
                    <p>Some of the countries needing economic aid are receiving assistance
                        multilaterally through the United Nations, but the problem is beginning to
                        assume tremendous proportions. We are trying to solve part of it through
                        disposal of our agricultural surpluses under <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >P.L.</gloss> 480 and use of the resultant local currency for aid
                        projects. The bulk of the local currency gained is being circulated in 30
                        year loans. A complication in disposing of surplus agricultural commodities
                        is the need to avoid cutting into the normal markets of a country. The
                        administration of the program is extremely difficult and has left the State
                        Department friendless. Grain raising countries want the Department to
                        encourage the selling of less while grain consuming countries want the
                        Department to encourage the selling of more.</p>
                    <p>Those administering the entire aid program are well aware of its
                        imperfections. The <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Committee
                        has been concerned with the failure of planners to have studied adequately
                        the economic effects of the military program before launching it. In Turkey,
                        for instance, many people were taken out of the consumers goods production
                        line for military service or military connected occupations, so that they
                        still remained consumers but were no longer producers. Turkey faces serious
                        inflation. It is possible that the same pattern may evolve in Spain.</p>
                    <p>Another matter of concern in the program is the tendency of the military
                        aspects to become progressively more expensive. This is due in part to the
                        cumulative cost of maintenance and to the increased cost of weapons.
                        Recipient countries always desire new weapons rather than castoffs. We
                        should do more to create a greater dependence on our strategic weapons, that
                        is largely on atomic weapons. To do so might lead to economies. There is a
                        great lack of acceptance in the countries with which we have mutual security
                        pacts that the next war is going to be an atomic war. First of all, none of
                        these countries wants to be an atomic target; secondly, these countries feel
                        that the United States might not be willing to wage an atomic war because it
                        would redound on the United States. Any atomic weapons, <pb n="122"
                            xml:id="pg_122" facs="0154"/>of course, would have to be in the hands of
                        the United States rather than its allies under present laws.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Fairless</persName> asked how much we could afford to spend on
                        an aid program and how long we could afford to spend it. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that some say our economy
                        has prospered despite the program, though we haven’t, of course, reduced the
                        national debt. What had to be remembered was that only ten per cent of the
                        security budget was being considered, though it was perhaps the most
                        important ten per cent. The question that needed answering was could we
                        afford to spend $40 billion. Mr. <persName>Fairless</persName> commented
                        that the aid should have the proper label. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> went on to say that since the aid money is spent in
                        the United States, it is a stimulus to American business.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Deupree</persName> said that the Advisers had been told that
                        there was $3 billion in gold going out of the country. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he would want to question
                        the views of the person who made that statement. The figure, he felt, was
                        partly attributable to the growing investments by foreigners. The figure set
                        up for our required gold reserve was done on the basis of a hypothetical
                        contingency, that is a sudden gold demand. We should look at ourselves in
                        this situation as a bank. No bank attempts to keep itself entirely liquid,
                        and no bankers whom he ever knew were made unhappy by increased deposits.
                        Mr. <persName>Deupree</persName> said that increased deposits necessitated
                        increased reserves. He then asked whether the most expensive item in our
                        security was the pay and expenses of our armed forces abroad. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> mentioned that our largest
                        expenditures abroad were tourist expenditures.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Lewis</persName> wanted to know why money
                        wasn’t available for investment in the countries of foreign investors. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that citizens of
                        those countries had more confidence in the United States than their own
                        countries. He added that their countries could, if they wanted to, stop the
                        outward flow of investment capital. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SALL1"
                            >Lewis</persName> commented that these countries which had its citizens
                        investing abroad were then pressing us for aid. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> explained that we were not being
                        pressed for aid by those countries which were investing in the United
                        States, such as Great Britain and France. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SALL1"
                            >Lewis</persName> wanted to know why something couldn’t be done about
                        Great Britain’s trading with China and France’s failure to meet her <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said it was difficult to control
                        those matters externally. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Lewis</persName>
                        pointed out the softness of the pound sterling and the French franc. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that they were soft,
                        that Britain was limiting its flow of gold but that France was finding it
                        difficult to do so.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Reid</persName> wanted to know if we reduced our forces,
                        whether it would be reasonable to assume that we could use our strategic <pb
                            n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0155"/>atomic weapons without retaliation.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that it would be a
                        hazardous assumption, that it would be dangerous to let the idea get about
                        that we were going to withdraw our forces, though we had withdrawn some
                        forces in Korea and perhaps might be able to streamline our forces in
                        Germany.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Deupree</persName> asked how much our economy could afford to
                        spend on the whole military picture. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> replied that the fortress of America concept was no
                        longer valid, that we had to have forces along the periphery of the Soviet
                        orbit, that there was no point in saving one dollar in the aid program when
                        it would mean spending ten dollars for the military establishment. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Lewis</persName> wanted to know for what
                        length of time we would have to continue our present expenditures in the
                        countries along the line from Korea to Turkey. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that he didn’t know, that
                        there were recently much more encouraging signs of things beginning to crack
                        on the inside. Khrushchev<note n="3" xml:id="d26fn3">Nikita S. Khrushchev,
                            First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.</note> in
                        his March letter stated that it had been impossible to change the policy of
                        Stalin as long as it had been successful. When the policy was changed, it
                        started a trend. The denial of successes to the Stalinist policy was due to
                        the policy that we’ve been pursuing, but that policy hasn’t served its day
                        yet. We need it as long as we have a hostile threat to face. By and large,
                        it is vitally essential that we shouldn’t let our policy falter just as
                        Russia is beginning to cave.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Lewis</persName> asked what yardstick was
                        being used in determining the amount of aid that was to be given to
                        Yugoslavia and Spain. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        replied that we had no pact with Yugoslavia, that our aid was largely
                        agricultural surpluses administered under <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >P.L.</gloss> 480. In the case of Spain, the main consideration was our
                        need for military bases there. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SALL1"
                            >Lewis</persName> wanted to know whether Russia mightn’t regard United
                        States aid to Yugoslavia as a help to Russia. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that he didn’t think so. The
                        United States wasn’t sending jet planes to Yugoslavia, though it wanted
                        them. Requests from Yugoslavia, generally, were declining. Tito was most
                        useful as an exhibit.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> concluded with a few brief
                        comments on the situation in Poland and Hungary and summed up by saying that
                        the blood of the martyrs was the seed of the church.</p>

                    <p>In introducing Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_PHV1"
                            >Prochnow</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">Jackson</persName>
                        referred to the recent article by Drew Pearson<note n="9" xml:id="d27fn9"
                            >Newspaper correspondent, author of the newspaper column, “The Daily
                            Washington Merry-Go-Round.”</note> on the activities of Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> and his committee. The
                        President expressed great irritation, and said that he believed that we
                        ought to get the Federal Bureau of Investigation to study this leak. He
                        remained astonished that such leaks continued to occur. It seemed to him
                        likely that some “clerk” far down the line in some department or other must
                        talk to people like Drew Pearson. The President observed philosophically
                        that he supposed that if one were engaged in intelligence activity there was
                        reason to read Drew Pearson’s column, but he could think of no other valid
                        reason.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> opened his report
                        to the Council with a brief comment on the Pearson statement, which he said
                        was totally without foundation.</p>
                    <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0157"/>
                    <p>After a brief description of the work of the interdepartmental committee,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> outlined the
                        principal conclusions of the committee’s studies. These conclusions dealt,
                        first, with the overall costs to the United States of the assistance
                        programs to the six countries which were regarded as most critical. He said
                        that this program would amount to $2 billion a year through 1960. His second
                        conclusion dealt with the ability of the six countries in question to
                        support their military programs. The <persName corresp="#p_PHV1"
                            >Prochnow</persName> Committee concluded that it was clearly beyond
                        their ability. The third conclusion dealt with the military capacity of
                        these six countries. It was concluded that, even taking into account our
                        military assistance, the military capabilities of these countries had not
                        been greatly enhanced when compared with the capabilities of the Soviet
                        bloc. The fourth conclusion dealt with economic growth in the six countries.
                        The <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Committee studies
                        concluded that, even with our large economic assistance, economic growth in
                        these countries had been very slight indeed. The last conclusion dealt with
                        possible obstacles which would confront the United States if it attempted
                        drastically to change these assistance programs. The <persName
                            corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Committee concluded that these
                        obstacles would be serious.</p>
                    <p>After dealing with the conclusions of the committee, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> outlined alternative courses of
                        action which were open to the United States. These were four in number.
                        First, we could go along present lines at a cost of about $2 billion a year
                        through 1960 for the six chief problem countries. Secondly, we could attempt
                        to reduce the burden on the U.S. economy by cutting back the economic
                        assistance programs to these countries. Thirdly, we might contemplate the
                        alternative of attempting to reduce our support of the military
                        establishments of these countries. Fourthly, we might elect to increase the
                        existing level of our economic assistance to these countries. (In each
                        instance Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> commented
                        briefly on the pros and cons to be anticipated in each of the above four
                        alternatives.)</p>
                    <p>In concluding this section of his report, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> indicated that at the conclusion
                        of their work one or two members of his committee had raised the question as
                        to how far the United States should build up indigenous military forces over
                        and above the level required to ensure internal security.</p>
                    <p>As the third and final portion of his report, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> summarized the chief issues raised
                        by his report, putting them in the form of the following three questions: <list>

                    <p>In conclusion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName>
                        expressed the hope that the report and work of his committee would prove
                        helpful in the achievement of policy decisions by the National Security
                        Council. The President thanked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PHV1"
                            >Prochnow</persName>, and said that all the members of the Council were
                        deeply obligated to him and to his committee.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">Jackson</persName> then called on the
                        Director of the International Cooperation Administration for any
                        supplementary observations he might wish to make on the foreign assistance
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> said that he would speak
                        briefly and generally. He did wish to emphasize that the factors which
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> had singled out as
                        applying to the six critical countries also applied in some degree to the
                        entire lot of fifty or sixty countries in which the International
                        Cooperation Administration was operating. Furthermore, the questions posed
                        by the so-called <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Report
                        could only be answered after adequate study by all the responsible agencies
                        straight across the board. No such adequate study had yet been made.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> then referred to the
                        Fairless Committee and to the Senate Committee which had been set up to
                        study our foreign aid programs.<note n="10" xml:id="d27fn10">The Senate
                            Special Committee to Study the Foreign Aid Program, established July 11,
                            1956, by Senate Resolution 285, 84th Congress. Chaired by Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName>, the committee was
                            composed of the full membership of the Foreign Relations Committee and
                            the chairmen and ranking minority members of the Committee on
                            Appropriations and the Armed Services Committee.</note> He indicated his
                        belief that these committees were proceeding effectively in pursuit of their
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> then indicated his
                        belief that the best help he could give the Council at the present time was
                        to repeat the conclusions which had been set forth in the status report on
                        the Mutual Security Programs as of June 30, 1956 (Part 2 of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5611). This report had, of course, already
                        been sent out to the National Security Council, but Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> doubted whether the members of
                        the Council had found time to read such a long report. Nevertheless, what
                        had been said by way of conclusion in the status report would be more
                        helpful than any new formulation. Accordingly, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> proceeded to read the page and a
                        half of conclusions of Part 2 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5611.
                        When he had completed his reading, he stated that essentially he was trying
                        to point out to the National Security Council that the studies by the
                            <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Committee really
                        constituted <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0159"/>only the first, though
                        fine, step in what must be a continuing study of the problem of foreign
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>The President then observed that a very important question would have to be
                        answered by the State Department. This was to find out how far the United
                        States could go in reducing its foreign assistance expenditures, given the
                        fact that the countries we were aiding had come to regard these expenditures
                        as commitments made solemnly by the United States. The President went on to
                        observe that most of us here present were already convinced that our
                        military assistance program world-wide was too large. The problem, however,
                        was how to reduce the size of this program without inducing disastrous
                        political repercussions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">Jackson</persName> then called on Assistant
                        Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> for his
                        supplementary observations.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> remarked that he could
                        not pose any more questions, and wouldn’t take the time to do so even if he
                        could. He said that he felt that the work of the <persName corresp="#p_PHV1"
                            >Prochnow</persName> Committee was a step forward to a solution of our
                        foreign assistance problem, but that we had not yet arrived at the solution.
                        The <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Committee had had
                        neither the competence nor the authority to evaluate much more than the
                        budgetary implications of the courses of action which it had analyzed.
                        Nevertheless, in addition to these budgetary implications there were very
                        significant economic, military and political factors and interrelationships
                        which remained to be assessed before any decision on these assistance
                        programs could be made. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName>
                        cited various examples in support of this thesis, and added that he was only
                        suggesting the difficulties which had faced the <persName corresp="#p_PHV1"
                            >Prochnow</persName> Committee and which the Fairless Committee in turn
                        would have to face. Accordingly, continued Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName>, he believed that hard decisions in
                        this area would have to be made by an instrumentality which had cognizance
                        of all the diverse considerations and interrelations which he had mentioned.
                        This meant the National Security Council or a body very much like it.</p>
                    <p>Refining his views, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName>
                        stated that in his opinion we could not continue to make individual country
                        decisions with respect to our assistance programs. He would therefore urge
                        that in any event the President direct that the total foreign assistance
                        picture be considered in any decision that is made with respect to aid
                        programs for individual countries. Such a decision must be made at a very
                        high level and with the full participation of all departments and agencies
                        having responsibility in the foreign assistance field.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> stated that he would
                        subscribe heartily and entirely to what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG2"
                            >Gray</persName> had just said. But he would go even further and state
                        that the foreign aid problem itself could not be considered alone. Before we
                        consider the foreign aid problem we <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0160"
                        />must answer the real question. This was: “What part of $5 billion a year
                        would we rather spend this way than spend on our own U.S. military
                        defenses?” Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> went on
                        to insist that we must be selective in our security expenditures. We must
                        give up talking about what we would like to do, and talk instead about what
                        we can afford. Until we are prepared to answer the basic question stated
                        above, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> insisted
                        that staff studies would be almost immaterial. Our staffs will study the
                        foreign assistance program until the cows come home without any solution
                        until this key question had been answered.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> was correct in strict terms of a business decision,
                        but had he thought that the really vital question might be put in a
                        different way—namely, how much would you rather spend than have a global war
                        or an armed attack on the United States? Everybody knew, said the President,
                        that he did not want to take the road that would lead to Socialism or
                        totalitarian controls in this country. Nevertheless, he did not believe that
                        we could look at the problem exclusively in the framework in which Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> had placed it. On the
                        contrary, the question we must start with is the question as to what the
                        security of the United States demands of us. Once having determined the
                        answer to this question, we could proceed to break it down into the priority
                        claims of our national security programs on our resources. Certainly we
                        could not base a vital decision like this on purely budgetary
                        considerations.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> expressed his
                        agreement with the President’s reasoning, but repeated that we could not
                        start with the details; we must start from the top in our programs and work
                        down, not start at the bottom and work up to the general level of
                        expenditure.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, turning to the
                        President, said that there was now no need for him to state the argument
                        which the President had just stated for him. However, he would like to add
                        that he agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> as
                        to the necessity for the National Security Council itself to make the big
                        decisions with respect to our assistance programs. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added that he had met for two hours
                        yesterday with the Fairless Committee. Some of the members of that Committee
                        were obviously knowledgeable; but by and large, it would be a miracle if
                        this Committee, in six short months, even began to understand the foreign
                        assistance problem to the degree that we in the National Security Council do
                        after living with it for years. Certainly the Fairless Committee was not
                        likely to make a decision on our foreign assistance programs which would be
                        automatically acceptable to this Administration. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> felt that in the end we would
                        probably not be able to do anything more <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129"
                            facs="0161"/>effective than to seek this decision from the President and
                        the top members of his Administration. With all our imperfections and
                        short-comings, we around this table are more conversant with the foreign
                        assistance problem than any outside group could possibly be after a mere six
                        months of study. All such human and psychological factors as were
                        represented by Syngman Rhee in Korea, or Magsaysay and Recto in the
                        Philippines, Diem<note n="11" xml:id="d27fn11"><gloss target="#t_NGO1"
                                >Ngo</gloss> Dinh Diem, President of South Vietnam.</note> and
                        Chiang Kai-shek,<note n="12" xml:id="d27fn12">Chiang Kai-shek, President of
                            the Republic of China.</note> would have to be dealt with, and an
                        outside committee would be ignorant of the magnitude of such very important
                        human factors. Such feelings and factors could not possibly be reflected in
                        the charts and statistics which were being studied by the Fairless
                        Committee. It could almost be described as “reckless” to leave such a
                        vitally important decision to individuals who do not have a grasp of these
                        factors.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> continued by stating
                        his own belief that in point of fact there was no need for as many as twenty
                        active divisions in the South Korean Army; but how difficult it was to
                        figure any means of cutting back the force levels in South Korea. Outside
                        committees haven’t the remotest idea of the real character of the problem.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> repeated his
                        conviction that the answer to the foreign assistance problem must be found
                        primarily in the combined wisdom of the people gathered around this table at
                        this time.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that despite this argument he thought there was still
                        some value in these committees, though he said he had never heard of any
                        plan that these committees should make decisions with respect to foreign aid
                        for the Administration.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> supported Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ view, and stated that the
                        responsibility for the decision centered in this room. Moreover, the
                        National Security Council ought to face up to it promptly. The President
                        inquired of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> whether
                        the latter thought he had all the facts necessary to face up to such a
                        decision. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> replied
                        that he did not so think, but that we should proceed to get the requisite
                        facts. Foreign aid spending was the most critical problem now facing the
                        present Administration. To solve that problem should be the first order of
                        business after the election.</p>

                        referred to a comment by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG2"

                        said he wished to relate this issue to the countries in question. He said he

                            xml:id="d27fn13">Paolo E. Taviani.</note> He said that Taviani had been
                        very expressive as to the favorable impact on the Italian people of
                        knowledge of the existence of this U.S. force on Italian soil with an atomic
                        capability. Taviani said it would have been impossible even to speak of such
                        a force on Italian soil six months ago. Now, however, <gloss
                            target="#t_SETAF1">SETAF</gloss> was welcomed by the Italians as
                        something very salutary in the way of an atomic back-up for Italy’s own
                        defense forces. Such a change could be related to the problems of Turkey and
                        Korea. In short, the political difficulties of stationing American forces
                        with atomic capabilities could probably be solved if we really set about to
                        solve them. Specifically, President Rhee might well agree to a reduction in
                        the level of his own armed forces if the United States promised to provide
                        back-up forces with an atomic capability in South Korea.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRB1"
                            >Robertson</persName> was suggesting was what this Administration had
                        really started out to do four years ago, in the form of the so-called new
                        look strategy. But instead of succeeding in reducing the costs of our
                        conventional armaments, the costs of both conventional and atomic armaments
                        had steadily risen.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> pointed to the value
                        of the study of the foreign aid programs by outside committees. He believed
                        that their findings could well result in influencing the Congress and the
                        American people to accept whatever final decision the Administration reached
                        with respect to the level of our foreign assistance expenditures.
                        Nevertheless, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said
                        that he was still curious to know why we imagined that the Fairless
                        Committee would come up with the right answer to this great problem, when we
                        ourselves don’t yet have the slightest idea what the answer is.</p>
                    <p>The President again repeated that he did not expect the Fairless Committee to
                        come up with the right answer. The President then went on to say that what
                        in essence this Government was really trying to do, when you get down to it,
                        was to prevent the Iron Curtain from advancing further or, indeed, to force
                        a retraction of that Curtain if we could. The question was the best and
                        cheapest means of achieving this objective. The President said that he had
                        felt for a long time that we have not been going about this course of action
                        in the right way. We had not chosen the best path. Furthermore, continued
                        the President, the best path must be to consider first the kind of foreign
                        assistance program which would be best from the strict point of view of U.S.
                        national security interests. Having made such a decision, we should then ask
                        the State Department to estimate the effect on other countries of trying to
                        put such a revised U.S. program into effect.</p>
                    <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0163"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was inclined to
                        disagree with the President, and thought that the two issues, of what was
                        best from the strict point of view of the United States and what would be
                        considered acceptable by the countries receiving our aid, should be studied
                        together and not in succession. He added that he believed it possible for
                        the United States to work out an aid program for Korea, Turkey, and the
                        others, which would cost us a lot less money. But there would remain the
                        problem of getting these countries to accept such a program without tearing
                        things to pieces because we had not related our program to the psychological
                        repercussions it was bound to cause in these friendly countries. Even this
                        could be done successfully, but the members of the National Security Council
                        are the best ones to do the job, not any outside committee.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> proposed as a
                        suggestion that after the election the Administration start formulating a
                        brand new general military program on the order of what we started to do
                        four years ago. After we have formulated such a program, that the Secretary
                        of State criticize it from his point of view, and let Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> criticize it from the financial and
                        budgetary point of view. Wouldn’t the end result of such an effort probably
                        be a pretty good assistance program?</p>
                    <p>The President cautioned that a program designed solely in our own particular
                        interests might very well “bust” the countries that we were purporting to
                        assist.</p>
                    <p>Agreeing with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>’s
                        proposal, Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> pointed
                        out that in fact we were just approaching the time when we were in the best
                        position to do what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>
                        had suggested. We are about to get a fresh mandate (we hope) from the
                        American people (some laughter). Moreover, the re-election of the
                        Administration will make the rest of the world aware that the present
                        Administration will be in power for at least four years more.</p>
                    <p>With some evidence of amusement, the President agreed that Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> might be right.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> asked if he might be
                        heard. He said that he was not as pessimistic about the foreign assistance
                        problem as many people were. He believed that the military aspects of this
                        problem could be ironed out, but there were two most important features
                        which he wished to stress if the problem were to be solved. The first
                        feature related to the stability of all these little countries around the
                        world. Essentially, their stability depended upon a conviction that the
                        United States would in fact assist them quickly if they were confronted by a
                        crisis and by aggression. Once these countries are really sure of this, they
                        will begin to get a climate of stability economically which they do not now
                        possess.</p>
                    <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0164"/>
                    <p>Secondly, said Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, and
                        even more important, is the bearing on our economic aid programs of the fact
                        that many U.S. corporations would gladly operate in overseas countries and
                        invest in these countries if they in turn could be assured of some degree of
                        stability and security for their operations and investment. In sum, if the
                        United States can go on record in such a way as to assure the peoples of
                        these foreign nations that we will provide help in case of need, we could
                        certainly look forward to a future period when these countries could advance
                        on their own. As for the specific military problem, <gloss
                            target="#t_SETAF1">SETAF</gloss> was a model. <gloss target="#t_SETAF1"
                            >SETAF</gloss> was equipped only with defensive atomic weapons. No one
                        could reasonably criticize it on this basis.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that as far as what Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> had been saying about the role of
                        private investment was concerned, practically all of it could be found set
                        forth in the National Security Council papers which were considered back in
                        April 1953. Further, the President said, he couldn’t agree more with Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, but the question was,
                        how do you get this private investment going? The President then reverted to
                        his previously expressed view that the first task before us was to determine
                        what as a minimum the United States requires as force levels to be
                        maintained in Turkey, Pakistan, Korea, and Formosa. If we could once figure
                        out the minimum forces that such countries ought to maintain in being, we
                        would then have something to start with by way of an assistance program.
                        Thereafter we could turn to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> and ask him whether he could sell such a program.
                        After all, he is the salesman of foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> asked to what extent
                        we were proposing to go back to the new look policy of four years ago. That
                        was the real question.</p>
                    <p>The President then suggested that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        Planning Board be asked to start a review of those countries where the
                        United States was really most heavily engaged in assistance programs. The
                        Planning Board should be asked to look at the analysis of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> report for each of these
                        countries, and having done so, review U.S. policy in each of these
                        countries. Careful attention should be paid to what constituted the minimum
                        demands of our national security with respect to the level of forces to be
                        maintained in these countries. If this were done perhaps we could gradually
                        approach an answer to our foreign assistance problem.</p>

                        midst of economic warfare and the entire aid program should, in my opinion,
                        recognize this. The trade embargo against Red China is one weapon; our aid
                        program is another. Our whole economic operation should be of a piece. This
                        is clearly stated in our U.S. policy objectives which, in regard to the aid
                        programs, may be summarized as follows: to curb the power and prevent the
                        expansion of international Communism and increase the strength and expand
                        the influence of free world countries.</p>
                    <p>The Communists have launched an economic offensive which in the past six
                        months has involved commitments of well over a billion dollars. An essential
                        principle of our response to this challenge in my opinion should be that we
                        should not outbid but out-perform the Communists. To do this, flexibility is
                        essential. I mean by flexibility that funds should be available to be used,
                        if, as, and when necessary in the U.S. interest and should not be tied to a
                        budget appropriation schedule under which their use must be determined about
                        two years in advance. The situation is too fluid for this fixed operation
                        type of procedure. Neither should our response to special urgent situations
                        be hampered by abstract general concepts which may prevent us from assisting
                        a nation in the solution of its most difficult problems.</p>
                    <p>Were it not for the President’s direct action, we might well have been
                        handicapped currently in the Hungarian and Polish developments by our
                        inability to react promptly and decisively in a new situation. This
                        flexibility should extend to trade as well as aid. We should be able to
                        spend our money fast at the point of need as it arises.</p>
                    <p>It has also been the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> policy not to give
                        development assistance in areas where we have surpluses for export. Rice and
                        tobacco are two commodity illustrations. Textile manufacturing is an <pb
                            n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0167"/>industry example. This refusal of a
                        request for assistance in certain areas raises doubts as to our real
                        intentions in giving aid and tends to turn some of these countries to the
                        Communists for solution of their major problems.</p>

                            <p>Ceylon became involved with Red China because she had rubber to sell
                                which the free world couldn’t buy. Rubber is life to Ceylon. The
                                Communists bought it and even offered a premium price. The defeat of
                                the conservative government under Sir <persName>John

                                government rapidly reaching additional accommodation with Communist
                                China may be partly traced to this development. Pre-emptive buying
                                of this rubber, which the U.S. could have used in any event, might
                                well have produced a different outcome.</p>
                            <p>A somewhat similar situation developed in Burma. The U.S. was selling
                                its surplus rice on concessional terms to Asian markets while
                                Burma’s rice surplus was soaring. The Soviets stepped in, bought up
                                Burma’s surplus, and contracted to take 400,000 tons a year for four
                                years.</p>

                    <p>From an economic standpoint, insertion of aid at the “top”, that is, the
                        financing of large-scale enterprises such as power plants, et cetera, is
                        undoubtedly the most efficient method, but it often has little or no popular
                        impact or dramatic appeal. America gets no popular credit for slowing down
                        inflation in a country. In this period, we need not only to improve the
                        economies of these countries—we need to make friends of their people. Too
                        often, the general economic situation in a country improves as a result of
                        our aid but it’s a case of “the rich getting richer” with little or no
                        impact on the little man.</p>
                    <p>Greater consideration needs to be given, in my opinion, to popular impact
                        programs and projects which create a friendly reaction.</p>

                    <p>Most of the countries of the Far East can repay loans—exceptions are Korea
                        and to a lesser extent Taiwan and Viet-Nam. In addition to being more
                        satisfactory from the U.S. point of view, loans have the following
                        advantages in most countries receiving assistance: <list>

                    <p>The distinction should not be on the basis of whether the loan is a “soft”
                        loan or a “hard” loan. There should be no factor in the decision as to
                        whether the aid should be extended as a grant or on a loan basis. Long term
                        loans, repayable in local currency for projects which otherwise could not
                        qualify for conventional loans by the Export-Import Bank or the <gloss

                    <p>There is an important area of exploration as to the type of loans to be made

                    <p>Basic economic development all over the world has been financed throughout
                        history by invested capital or loans, private or government, whether we are
                        talking about the United States, Europe or Latin America. Countries with the
                        potential resources of Indonesia, Burma, Thailand, should not need grants
                        for revenue-producing enterprises and probably not for basic non-revenue
                        producing projects such as roads and bridges.</p>

                    <p>The thing that impresses me most about our aid program is that we are
                        spending billions of dollars and muffing a great opportunity. We are doing
                        this by getting in our own light. There is no doubt in my mind that these
                        programs saved Europe from Communism after the war and have done the same
                        for many countries in Asia during the past few years. But there is no
                        gainsaying the fact that the major irritants in our relations with many
                        countries in the Far East today have their sources in these same
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>The twin evils from which these programs suffer are both traceable to
                        administration. These are (1) procedural complexities which Asians do not
                        understand and resent as interference with their own affairs; (2) lags in
                        program implementation, also due largely to complex procedures. Three

                            Washington with the months and months of delay this entails. This,
                            incidentally, is a major problem for our Missions themselves. Most
                            members of Mission staffs spend more time justifying to Washington what

                        effectiveness can be greatly increased. To accomplish this, however,
                        flexibility of decision and operation not now possible under requirements of
                        law must be provided. The program needs to be regarded as a major cold war
                        weapon. It should be prepared for utilization under such circumstances and
                        conditions as enable maximum exploitation of its capabilities.</p>

                    <p>It would be very easy, and it is very tempting, to address the most
                        devastating criticism to this report and to develop at length on the theme
                        suggested by one person that seldom have the taxpayers of a country been
                        asked to pay $10,000 a page for 19 pages of such trash and trivia. However,
                        one must recognize that this report is the product of compromises among, and
                        a conglomerate of, the conflicting <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0170"
                        />views of 7 individuals who obviously were unable to come to an agreement
                        on many fundamental points and who, for the most part, and in spite of their
                        generally outstanding abilities, had been able to devote insufficient study
                        to problems which, in the aggregate, are certainly more complicated and less
                        susceptible to exact treatment than, say, the problems that constitute the
                        field of nuclear physics. Moreover, it would be less than fair if we did not
                        recognize that the committee did reach and express, sometimes,
                        unfortunately, with mysterious and disturbing qualifications, or less
                        coherently and forcefully than might be desirable, a set of important
                        general principles with respect to the need for and the capacity of the U.S.
                        to provide assistance to other friendly countries. These principles deserve
                        the most serious consideration, since they do reflect agreement among this
                        group of individually very different 7 persons, and since they do constitute
                        the kind of broad judgments that a group of this kind is probably qualified
                        to reach.</p>
                    <p>Before commenting on some of the more important specific conclusions in the

                            <item>On many important matters the report appears to be internally
                                inconsistent and to contain recommendations which are conflicting in
                                nature or in purpose. The report, as someone has said, and using a
                                trite phrase, can “mean all things to all men”, and the newspaper
                                treatment of it certainly demonstrates this fact. These
                                inconsistencies and conflicts are particularly noticeable in
                                connection with the problems of (1) future cost of the program; and

                            <item>The report is difficult to deal with because of the impreciseness
                                with which it repeatedly uses, and uses in new contexts, certain
                                words and phrases. The most difficult problem in this regard is
                                created by the use of the terms “collective security programs”,
                                “collective security system”, “collective security of the free
                                world”, “collective security costs”, and “collective security”. It
                                is frequently unclear whether the term “collective” is intended to
                                be synonymous with “mutual”; whether, by using a word normally
                                restricted to international action in defense against external
                                aggression we are talking about a military system of alliances and
                                aid, or a somewhat broader concept; etc. One is therefore left with
                                a somewhat muddled concept as to the kind of free world strength,
                                structure and relationships that our aid program should seek to
                                create.</item>

                            <item>The undefined concept of “collective security” which is referred
                                to in (2) above has resulted in the introduction of new measures of
                                the level of U.S. contributions to the security of other countries
                                which I find very confusing and which I believe complicate to an
                                impossible degree the question of measuring the probable future
                                cost, and the capacity of the U.S. to finance, aid programs <pb
                                    n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0171"/>that will be required in
                                the years ahead. To equate the U.S. contribution to “collective
                                security” with the particular expenditures specified in Part III of
                                the supplement and which constitute the foundation of the figures
                                used in the report proper, makes no sense conceptually. The U.S.
                                contribution to “collective security” of the free world quite
                                obviously includes a large part of the total defense expenditures of
                                the U.S., even though those expenditures are made in the U.S., and I
                                can see no benefit in trying to divide this contribution to
                                “collective security” into parts on the basis attempted by the
                                committee. The only result is to create popular confusion as to the
                                size of our “mutual security program” and to establish a false
                                hypothesis against which to measure the capacity of the U.S. to
                                carry on the “mutual security program” in the future.</item>

                            <item>The report suffers throughout from what I might describe as the
                                lack of basic political, economic and even military concepts. For
                                example, the committee gives no indication that it understands the
                                facts of life concerning modern warfare and therefore concerning the
                                role in such warfare which countries such as Pakistan, Vietnam,
                                Korea, etc., might play. Thus the report contains sentences such as
                                the following: “Sizeable contributions by all the participants [in
                                the collective security system]<note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">Brackets

                                this structure.”; and “The U.S. needs the aid of other countries
                                just as they need our assistance.” I gain the impression also that
                                the committee as a whole has very little “feel” as to political and
                                economic conditions actually existing in many of the foreign
                                countries, as to the problems of development and government that
                                confront many of these other countries, and, in fact, as to the
                                problems involved in conducting a major operation within the U.S.

                                to collective security and should be continued on a substantial
                                scale. It warns specifically that “the United States must abandon

                                strength and by promoting economic development. It speaks in the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName>Clarence</persName></hi>: I am writing in
                        answer to your request for my comments on the report dated March 1, 1957 of
                        the Presidential Advisers on the Mutual Security Program. You will
                        understand, I am sure, that the views I express are personal and
                        off-the-record; also that I am not in any position to comment on military
                        aid and defense support programs as such.</p>
                    <p>If you remember the two papers I sent you on September 5, 1956,<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d31fn2">Not further identified.</note> you will not be surprised
                        to learn that I am, in general, disappointed in the report.</p>
                    <p>The report contains several proposals and many individual statements with
                        which I am in agreement. For example, I welcome the recognition that foreign
                        aid must be a long-term program, that some economic assistance is needed
                            (<ref target="#pg_18">p. 18</ref>) and should be administered separately
                        from the military aid (<ref target="#pg_13">p. 13</ref>), that expansion of
                        trade and reduction of tariff barriers are desirable (<ref target="#pg_7">p.
                            7</ref>), that private investment should be encouraged (<ref
                            target="#pg_8">p. 8</ref>) and that dollar loans should be based on
                        judgments of creditworthiness (<ref target="#pg_10">p. 10</ref>). I think
                        the proposals for two-year appropriations (<ref target="#pg_14">p. 14</ref>)
                        and flexibility in expenditure (<ref target="#pg_14">p. 14</ref>) are sound.
                        I appreciate the expression of approval of the work of this Bank and of the
                        potentialities of the International Finance Corporation (<ref target="#pg_9"
                            >p. 9</ref>).</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, I seriously disagree with several positions taken in the
                        report and I am not happy about its general tone and approach in so far as
                        economic aid is concerned. I will confine my comments to matters that seem
                        to me to be of major importance.</p>

                    <p>I was disappointed to find so little analysis of the problem. The report
                        contains little discussion of the needs for and purposes of economic aid and
                        almost no analysis of the various means by which those needs and purposes
                        can be met, of the ways in which the various sectors of the foreign aid
                        program have met or failed to meet those needs and purposes, and the reasons
                        therefor, and of the very wide differences that seem to me to exist between
                        different countries and different areas of the world in all these
                        respects.</p>

                    <p>The conclusions of the report, and such analysis as it contains, all lean
                        heavily, in my opinion far too heavily, in the direction of justifying all
                        aid on strategic considerations. Although some economic aid is conceded to
                        be necessary, it is very definitely treated as the tail of the dog. It is
                        apparently intended that little aid, if any, shall be made available to
                        countries outside of the collective security system except by the
                        Export-Import Bank, World Bank and Monetary Fund (<ref target="#pg_11">p.
                            11</ref>).</p>
                    <p>As I think you know, this does not correspond to my thinking. I believe that
                        there are countries in the world which cannot achieve a desirable rate of
                        development solely by means of repayable foreign exchange loans. A number of
                        these, including some of the most important, are outside the collective
                        security system.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, I feel very strongly that justifying economic aid by security
                        considerations will harm the program. I am convinced that economic aid can
                        be far more effective if it is divorced from politico-military strategy, not
                        only in being administered by a separate agency, as the report suggests, but
                        also, and more importantly, by being administered in the light of different
                        objectives and standards. These should in my opinion be economic and not
                        strategic.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Standards of Administration</hi></p>
                    <p>The report contains very little about standards of administration of economic
                        aid. This is perhaps inevitable in view of the lack of clarity about
                        objectives. I was disappointed to find nothing in the report about using
                        economic aid to encourage local effort and local savings, nothing about
                        laying down standards of performance upon which further aid can be
                        conditioned, and nothing about subordinating short-term commercial interests
                        to long-term economic aims in the administration of economic aid. I was also
                        disappointed to find no clear discussion of the desirability of
                        concentrating economic aid on specific projects or programs, although the
                        recommendation for selectivity and reduction in number of projects (<ref
                            target="#pg_15">p. 15</ref>) seems to suggest a leaning in this
                        direction.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Loans Repayable in Local Currency Versus
                            “Liberal” Loans Repayable in Dollars</hi></p>
                    <p>I strongly disagree with the view suggested under the heading “Loan Policy
                        Recommendations” (<ref target="#pg_10">p. 10</ref>), namely that when
                        conventional dollar loans are inappropriate because of creditworthiness
                        considerations, resort should be had to long-term, low-interest-rate dollar
                        loans. The alternative of loans repayable in local currency is condemned on
                        the ground that they would jeopardize the soundness of the loan device. As
                        one of the original opponents of “fuzzy” <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143"
                            facs="0175"/>loans, I am distressed to see my point turned upside down.
                        Long-term, low-interest-rate dollar loans do “jeopardize the soundness of
                        the loan device” by burdening the recipient countries with additional
                        foreign exchange obligations and making the terms of conventional dollar
                        loans appear oppressive. Their use on any large scale would severely limit
                        the effectiveness of conventional lending institutions and set up another
                        serious barrier to the return of private capital to the field of
                        international lending. Loans repayable in local currency, on the other hand,
                        do not create foreign exchange obligations which compete with the claims of
                        conventional lenders; indeed if properly formulated, they accomplish a
                        transfer of resources to the recipient country which serves to build up its
                        economic strength and hence its creditworthiness for conventional loans.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Capacity to Repay</hi></p>
                    <p>I am glad to see the firm statement (<ref target="#pg_10">p. 10</ref>) that
                        loans should not be granted in circumstances in which there is grave doubt
                        of repayment capacity. But the Advisers apparently believe that a program of
                        fostering economic development can be financed on a repayable dollar loan
                        basis, except in “exceptional cases” (<ref target="#pg_10">p. 10</ref>)
                        which should be “severely limited” (<ref target="#pg_11">p. 11</ref>). In my
                        opinion, as I have said above, there are a number of countries, some of them
                        countries of great importance, which cannot achieve a desirable rate of
                        development solely on the basis of repayable foreign exchange loans and
                        which will also require for that purpose either loans repayable in local
                        currency or grants.</p>
                    <p>With respect to these countries the report misses an essential point.
                        Economic aid which does not burden the balance of payments (grants and local
                        currency loans) will normally <hi rend="italic">increase</hi> the amount of
                        conventional lending that can be done. Economic aid which does burden the
                        balance of payments (dollar loans, whether conventional or “liberal”) may
                        merely <hi rend="italic">replace</hi> conventional lending in whole or part.
                        As I told the Advisers, the scope of World Bank lending in country after
                        country depends on American aid being forthcoming in forms which will not
                        burden the balance of payments.</p>
                    <p>This consideration, moreover, makes me doubt the soundness of the report’s
                        proposal (<ref target="#pg_12">p. 12</ref>) that U.S. surplus agricultural
                        stocks should be sold for cash in dollars, though at reduced prices.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Obscurity</hi></p>
                    <p>On several critical points, as the above comments indicate, I find the report
                        somewhat obscure. I may therefore have misunderstood the intentions of the
                        Advisers in some respects and have made criticisms for which there is no
                        real basis in their thinking. Of more <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144"
                            facs="0176"/>importance is the fact that this obscurity may confuse the
                        public, which is already sufficiently confused in its thinking about
                        economic aid.</p>
                    <p>In summary, I do not think this report provides the “new articulation of the
                        purposes of foreign economic aid and its relation to United States
                        interests” to which I looked forward in September. I very much regret being
                        critical of the work of such eminent Americans who have generously responded
                        to a call for public service, but I would be less than frank if I said I
                        thought the report was a satisfactory basis for the formulation of foreign
                        economic aid policy.</p>

                    <p>In reviewing any report of this nature I realize the difficulty which the
                        group had to overcome in trying in a short time to understand and consider
                        the ramifications and complications of the largest and most diversified
                        foreign economic operation in the history of the world. It was manifestly
                        impossible for them to do more than hit the high spots. That they were able
                        to achieve unanimity on this report is a great achievement in itself.</p>
                    <p>In our review we must naturally consider first the proposed changes in
                        existing principles and practices, and it is, of course, comments on these
                        which you have requested. Next, however, as a <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145"
                            facs="0177"/>practical matter we must consider the question of timing
                        and feasibility. Some of the changes in principles and practices which
                        should be put into effect on theory cannot be accomplished soon enough to be
                        applied to the Mutual Security legislation in the coming Congress. Perhaps
                        some of the changes are impossible of achievement simply because Congress
                        just won’t approve them irrespective of the time they are presented.
                        Furthermore, we must remember that these large and far flung efforts in some
                        seventy countries which we call the Mutual Security Program, make, in the
                        composite, a great stream which can be dammed or diverted only with
                        considerable effort but cannot be turned on and off with a spigot.</p>
                    <p>In making a review of a report perhaps we should also consider omissions. For
                        instance, I find little in the report on the following important subjects: <list>

                                A corollary of this is the extent to which we should advertise our

                                of the funds insured have gone into those countries whose economies

                    <p>You will find in this folder the results of my effort to coordinate agency
                        thinking with regard to the Fairless report.</p>
                    <p>I asked for written statements from: State, <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                            >ICA</gloss>, Defense, Treasury, Commerce, Agriculture, Budget, <gloss

                            >Eximbank</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>I received such written statements from all agencies but Treasury.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d33fn2">For the letters from the Department of State and <gloss

                            enclosure below contains a summary of the positions of all major
                            respondents on the 23 Fairless Committee recommendations with the
                            exception of the Treasury which submitted its comments too late for
                            inclusion.</note> You will find them in this folder, and I think that
                        you will agree with me that they are thoughtful documents. In fact, one of
                        the useful aspects of the appointment of the Fairless group is that it has
                        caused the agencies themselves to re-survey their own questions.</p>
                    <p>Today, I invited the representatives of the agencies to meet with me for
                        further discussion of this subject.</p>
                    <p>We found that the Fairless report presented 23 questions for decision, and we
                        asked the agencies to address themselves to those specific points.</p>
                    <p>In this folder, you will find a page for each such question, which gives at
                        the top the text of the Fairless recommendation, then the results of the
                        discussion, and finally my recommendation.</p>
                    <p>You will find that some of these questions are so basic that they could not
                        possibly have been resolved in the short period of time available since the
                        filing of this report. All that I have been able to <pb n="147"
                            xml:id="pg_147" facs="0179"/>do on these is to outline for you the
                        nature of the problem. Many of them must have further study.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>, General <persName
                            corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, and others felt that the proper
                        forum for endeavoring to arrive at an agreed position in the first instance
                        was the Council on Foreign Economic Policy, and I have therefore recommended
                        that some of these come back here for further study.</p>
                    <p>Where it seemed appropriate, I have suggested that the problems be referred
                        to other agencies for further study.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, by his letter, has
                        helpfully drawn attention to those recommendations in the Fairless report
                        which contravene existing <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy.</p>
                    <p>I also took the liberty of asking for a confidential personal letter from
                        Gene <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Black</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d33fn3"

                        but should not be widely circulated.</p>
                    <p>There was agreement among us that, even though there were differences as to
                        particular points of the Fairless study, it should not be forgotten that
                        this group, by its unanimous and friendly report, has brought support to the
                        Administration.</p>
                    <p>It was also pointed out that in the trade and foreign investment fields,
                        which are not involved in my current studies for you because they required
                        no action, the Fairless group has made an important contribution to the
                        support of the President’s liberal views.</p>
                    <p>I shall be glad to follow through on the implementation of my recommendations
                        if you wish to have me.</p>

                        <p>The United States Government should increase its efforts to make known,
                            both at home and abroad, the productive contributions and possibilities
                            of private capital. This can and should be done by our diplomatic
                            missions and by friendship and commerce treaties. In our opinion, this
                            effort has not been pursued, thus far, with the vigor that the obvious
                            benefits that such an undertaking would justify. (Page 8)</p>

                        <p>We believe that the guaranty program has been extended as far as it
                            should be. It is our belief that guaranties against losses and the other
                            proposed arrangements will not provide adequate stimuli to private
                            foreign investment because business firms will not invest abroad unless
                            they have reasonable assurance that their operations will continue in
                            existence for a considerable period. In other words, they want
                            going-enterprises abroad rather than guaranties against losses.</p>

                            to exchange of information and policy coordination between the two banks

                        <p>We do not agree that all such loans are undesirable and that the practice
                            of granting them should be terminated as recommended in the Fairless
                            Report. We believe that the granting of such loans should meet carefully
                            developed criteria. At times such loans would certainly be in the
                            national interest. Such loans contribute to the strengthening of the
                            borrowing country’s economy and, therefore, improves its credit
                            worthiness for conventional loans.</p>

                        <p>In order to improve administration, to clarify what is being done, and to
                            facilitate the legislative process, it is recommended that there be a
                            separation between economic and military contribution to the collective
                            security program. All forms of proposed military assistance should be
                            submitted to the Congress as a separate title within the regular Defense
                            budget. That separate title should include all of which is now labeled
                            “military assistance” in the Mutual Security Program and also that
                            portion of what is now called “defense support” which is in fact for
                            support of local military requirements. All forms of nonmilitary
                            assistance should be submitted separately and labeled as economic
                            assistance, to be justified and administered by the Department of State.

                                    identification of economic aid would make it more vulnerable to

                        believe, thoughtful and forward looking. The Department of State finds the
                        Board’s report, as a whole, a most useful example of public participation in
                        the process of policy formulation.</p>

                        <p>The report by the International Development Advisory Board is not a
                            report on the Mutual Security Program as a whole. As its title indicates
                            the report is concerned only with economic development. It calls for a
                            new emphasis on long-term economic development as a major objective of
                            our foreign policy. To make this emphasis effective, it recommends among
                            other things a long-term program of economic development assistance,
                            administered with flexibility, and separated clearly from military aid.
                            We fully endorse these elements of the <gloss target="#t_IDAB1"
                                >IDAB</gloss> report. Our comments on the specific changes
                            recommended in the Mutual Security Program follow: <list>

                                            proposes the establishment of an International
                                            Development Fund to operate through the International
                                            Cooperation Administration of the Department of State.
                                            The Fund would provide for technical assistance and
                                            capital for economic development in underdeveloped
                                            areas</hi>.</p>
                                    <p>We concur in the desirability of establishing a mechanism
                                        which would put the U.S. program for foreign economic
                                        development on a flexible and long-term basis. We agree that
                                        this can best be accomplished through the establishment of
                                        an International Development Fund which, at least initially,
                                        should be operated through <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                                            >ICA</gloss>. It should operate in close coordination
                                        with other lending institutions such as the Export-Import
                                        Bank and the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, and
                                        should control the local currency proceeds of <gloss

                                        used for development purposes.</p>
                                    <p>We do not agree that this Fund should provide both technical
                                        assistance and capital for economic development. Funds for
                                        these purposes should be separately identified but
                                        administered in such a way as to reinforce each other. In
                                        our view technical assistance should continue to be
                                        administered on a grant basis, and funds should therefore be
                                        sought separately through an annual
                                    appropriation.</p></item>

                                            without requiring additional financing. Congress would
                                            replenish working capital as the Fund’s needs are
                                            demonstrated</hi>.</p>
                                    <p>As indicated in the comment on (1) above, we agree that funds
                                        for development assistance should be sought on terms which
                                        would ensure continuity and flexibility. To achieve this
                                        result and to increase the effectiveness of our economic
                                        development program so as to obtain the maximum results from
                                        the available funds, it is important that we break away from
                                        the annual cycle of illustrative programs, appropriations
                                        and pressure for rapid obligation of funds. It is also
                                        important that we be able to make effective and reasonably
                                        long-term advance commitments for sound development
                                        projects.</p>
                                    <p>It is not clear, however, that a three-year appropriation is
                                        the only or the best method of achieving this result. The
                                        Department of State would favor the establishment for this
                                        purpose of an International Development Fund to be
                                        administered on a loan basis as described in the comment on

                                        Fairless report we consider that over a period of time some
                                        increase in the amount of funds available for capital
                                        development and technical assistance may well be necessary.

                                    cooperation reach some satisfactory answer. I’m not too

                                the progress will be only gradual. I realize that some (head of

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName>Clarence</persName></hi>: I am sorry not
                        to have written you before but I was away for a few days when your letter
                        with the Fairless Committee report came.</p>
                    <p>Enclosed herewith is a memorandum prepared for me which gives some points of
                        interest to us.<note n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">Not printed, but see <ref
                                target="#d37"><hi rend="italic">infra</hi></ref>.</note> However,
                        the principal thing which I find lacking in the report is the statement of
                        the basic philosophy of just what it is that we are trying to obtain by the
                        use of money of this kind.</p>
                    <p>It is all well and good to talk about helping to stabilize the world, etc.,
                        but it seems to me that we are in a great contest between two almost
                        opposite ideologies: one based on freedom of the individual in the
                        development of individual initiative for his own benefit, the fruits of his
                        initiative to belong to him; the other based on the all-powerful state
                        directing the activities of the individual for the benefit of the state and
                        the common interest. The basic distinction between the two is a recognition
                        of the rights to and protection of private property because private property
                        is the reward for individual activity freely indulged in to whatever extent
                        each individual desires for his own benefit. This, of course, is entirely
                        lacking in the other system.</p>
                    <p>My great criticism of our past programs has been that we have been, in many
                        cases, building up governmental regimes, strengthening the power of states,
                        and thereby lessening the opportunity for the advancement of individual
                        freedom. When we give money in large amounts for the development of
                        projects, not only governmental in nature but also commercial, to the
                        politicians who then happen to be in control of a country, we are
                        tremendously strengthening the state as opposed to the individual and
                        lessening the opportunity for the individual ever to compete with the
                        state.</p>
                    <p>This is exactly the opposite of the ideology which we are spending so much
                        money to defend and of which we are so proud, I think our gifts, grants,
                        loans, or whatever in the future should be directed much more to the
                        development of individual activity and much less to the aggrandizement of
                        any state or the politicians temporarily running it.</p>
                    <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0209"/>
                    <p>It is true that there are some proper governmental activities which serve as
                        a base for the operation of individual activity in which we can properly
                        participate but the development of transportation systems other than
                        highways, power and water systems, and all sorts of commercial enterprise by
                        the state simply entrenches its system against the individual and retards
                        the development of individual freedom. We are getting the cart before the
                        horse because until you first have the development of individual
                        productivity, there are few customers for the transportation, power and
                        water systems, etc. that we have been building up.</p>
                    <p>The first need is the development of a people with initiative and enterprise,
                        with hope of reward for their own effort. This can come only when government
                        protects the fruits of effort, viz., the security of private property
                        created as a result of such effort. You can count the countries anywhere in
                        the world (especially backward ones) on your fingers where this prerequisite
                        exists and where it is guaranteed, especially to foreigners. Under no other
                        circumstances will foreign capital flow freely into a country, and we are
                        doing very little to promote and require it. Wherever it does exist, the
                        country is developing and flourishing.</p>
                    <p>This prime objective should always be first in our consideration of any case
                        and unless it is promoted, our favorable action should be withheld.
                        Otherwise, we will simply continue to build up a flock of foreign dictators
                        who will be absolutely unreliable and whose friendship and support we can
                        never count on. For dependable support, we must count only upon individual
                        freedom-loving and individual freedom-practicing countries which believe in
                        and want to continue to live in our way of life. There are, of course, many
                        degrees of the extent to which this can obtain, but our support should be
                        curtailed or entirely eliminated unless constant progress toward our own
                        ideals is actually being made.</p>
                    <p>1) If we stick by this cardinal principle, 2) if we put the cost of supplying
                        military equipment and military economic support directly on the Defense
                        Department which has to agree to the force goals of the countries involved
                        so that the cost of that support will come directly out of Defense funds, 3)
                        if we work out a simple, cooperative coordination for the handling of
                        defense support funds by the Foreign Economic Division of the State
                        Department but for the account and expense of the Defense Department, and 4)
                        if we limit actual economic aid only to those Countries which are
                        progressing in accordance with our ideals, with a comparatively few
                        well-chosen projects in a comparatively few conspicuous places, we will be
                        able to control and build up friends and supporters whom we can depend upon
                        in time of need. The great complexity of the present set-up <pb n="178"
                            xml:id="pg_178" facs="0210"/>will disappear as its organization and
                        activities are drastically reduced and centered only on a few important,
                        well-chosen projects.</p>
                    <p>No great structure ever was built by scattering efforts all over the place in
                        homeopathic doses. Rigidly controlled concentration will permit finishing
                        just one thing at a time and having it so commercially sound and well set
                        that after once started it will continue to prosper and grow on its own
                        without further aid and be an example of free enterprise for the community.
                        In this way, if well done when the job is finished, we will gradually build
                        a great and strong network of dependable associates.</p>
                    <p>Detailed comments on your numbered list are enclosed.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName>Clarence</persName></hi>: I have just
                        finished reviewing your Fairless Report recommendations and compliment you
                        upon the neat, compact form in which you have presented it. It is very
                        apparent that all of the knotty problems in paragraphs 6, 7, 8, and 11
                        require further study and a subcommittee of <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss> as a preliminary step is certainly a good way to begin
                        it.</p>
                    <p>I must raise a question about Recommendation 10. I fear very greatly that if
                        we don’t watch our step we will become involved in <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> and all of the other schemes which
                        are everlastingly put forward to have us join with others in multilateral
                        action which always results in our putting up the money and our associates
                        deciding how to spend it. I am not adverse, of course, to joining with
                        somebody else in putting up money together, but the only time I have ever
                        seen it really offered was in collaboration with Great Britain and the
                        original Aswan High Dam negotiations, when it was a case of one rabbit for
                        them, one horse for us for the money, with equal voice in expenditures. I
                        hope this will be very carefully watched. It sounds fuzzy to me.</p>
                    <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0211"/>
                    <p>Recommendation 14—I think it is not only feasible but extremely desirable to
                        take the first step now and to transfer to the Defense budget military
                        hardware and training items for current presentation, even though defense
                        support and economic aid cannot be separated at this time. I think the
                        President should be asked to reconsider this recommendation.</p>
                    <p>Recommendation 15—It has always seemed to me that the ideal set-up by <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and State is in the nature of a
                        self-contained bureau operating within a Department, in the same way that
                        Customs, Internal Revenue and others operate within the Treasury, being
                        given over-all supervision and control but effective, independent action for
                        operations.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> briefed the Council, in the
                        course of which he paid particular attention to the charts which appeared at
                        the back of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/5 together with
                        material to indicate in what countries of the world we were paying the
                        largest per capita amount in the <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss> of
                        our assistance programs. (A copy of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                            >Cutler</persName>’s briefing note and tables are included in the
                        minutes of the meeting.) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>
                        stated that he did not know whether his figures really proved anything, but
                        they served to dramatize where our money was going. He then asked Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>, the Director of the
                        International Cooperation Administration, whether he would care to comment
                        on these charts and tables.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> observed that any charts
                        dealing with the categories of expenditure for the various parts of our
                        military and economic assistance programs were bound to have a somewhat
                        arbitrary character. He would take Laos as an example (this was the country
                        which was receiving the largest per capita amount of U.S. assistance), and
                        reminded the Council that our contribution to Laos was largely to pay the
                        wages of the Laotian Army. Accordingly, this was in a real sense military
                        rather than economic assistance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then turned to Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>, the Chairman of the Council on
                        Foreign Economic Policy, and invited him, by prearrangement, to go through
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/5. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> observed that a great many of the
                        questions posing economic issues relating to the revision <pb n="181"
                            xml:id="pg_181" facs="0213"/>of our basic national security policy would
                        sound very familiar to the members of the Council. He also expressed the
                        view that even if there were no Soviet Union or International Communism to
                        threaten the security of the United States, there would be other reasons of
                        national self-interest which would dictate that the United States provide
                        assistance to certain foreign countries.</p>
                    <p>Thereafter, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> turned to the
                        first major subject of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/5, and read
                        the paragraphs as follows:</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">“I. Allocation of U.S. Foreign
                            Assistance</hi></p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>“1. a. In the allocation of our assistance to less developed countries,
                            should we give more emphasis to economic development and less emphasis
                            to military assistance?</p>
                        <p>“b. Does the current allocation of aid among countries best promote U.S.
                            security interests?”</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>After he had read the questions formulated by the Planning Board as above,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> asked Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> for an expression of opinion on the
                        question in paragraph 1–a.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that he
                        thought it quite difficult to try to answer such questions as these in
                        general terms. It was better to try to answer the questions in relation to
                        concrete cases in specific countries. For example, as to the very high level
                        of U.S. resources being devoted to South Korea, we in this Administration
                        had felt that it was worth paying a good deal to put an end to the war in
                        Korea. Moreover, we believe that it is a lot cheaper to do what we are now
                        doing in Korea than to be obliged to carry on a war there. Yet, even though
                        we must stand by our commitments to South Korea, we should do what we have
                        to do in the most economical and efficient way.</p>
                    <p>By and large, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, we should probably put greater emphasis on our
                        assistance to less developed countries for their economic development, and
                        less emphasis on military assistance. The best way to accomplish this
                        purpose without resorting to increased levels of expenditure would be for
                        the United States to create and maintain a long-term development fund from
                        which loans could be made to the countries we needed to assist. The most
                        wasteful and inefficient way to do it was as we are now doing it. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> did not see how the
                        International Cooperation Administration performed as well as it did,
                        considering the manifold difficulties which it faced under the present terms
                        of the mutual security legislation. The <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                        had no means of knowing from one year’s end to the next what resources
                        Congress would permit it to make available for its assistance programs.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that it was
                        his belief that if we could succeed in getting our economic development
                        assistance onto a more <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0214"/>or less
                        permanent basis, with the countries we were aiding coming up with their own
                        long-range development plans instead of accepting our plans, we could make a
                        shift to a much more efficient operating basis. As of now, we were
                        completely unable to give any long-term commitments for carrying out
                        economic development programs in these countries.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added that his
                        arguments in favor of increased emphasis on economic development did not
                        necessarily mean increased U.S. levels of expenditure but, rather, more
                        effective management and methods. He was “dead sure” that the impact on
                        these less developed countries of the example set by the Soviet Union, in
                        becoming the second greatest industrial nation in the world, was very great
                        indeed. This impact was heightened by the fact that the Soviet achievement
                        was accomplished in the span of a single generation. Of course, said
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, the people of these
                        underdeveloped areas ignore the cruel and terrible methods by which the
                        Soviets had achieved their goal; they only saw the results. Nevertheless, if
                        the United States and the Free World cannot provide some real hope of
                        lifting these poverty-stricken countries out of their misery, they were
                        quite likely to follow Soviet examples and methods.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that of course
                        all of us would like to see our economic objectives in the under-developed
                        countries achieved through the use of private capital investment. But some
                        of the most critical of these under-developed countries existed under
                        conditions where they will have to be able to see genuine hope of a
                        transformation provided by the West, or else they will turn to the USSR. So
                        large were these under-developed areas that if they turn to the Soviet Union
                        the area of the Free World will shrink by another two-thirds. Accordingly,
                        we have got to provide economic development assistance, and furthermore, we
                        must as a nation realize more fully the importance of this assistance to our
                        national security. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        added the hope that there would be a growing acceptance throughout the Free
                        World, and especially in the under-developed countries, of the principle
                        that the United States provided the great military deterrent to Communist
                        aggression. If this realization became clear, it could result in a reduction
                        in the levels of military forces maintained by these poor countries, and
                        likewise in the level of U.S. military assistance provided to these
                        countries. After all, it was both our own theory and, indeed, a fact, that
                        it was the military might of the United States which provided these small
                        countries with the real deterrent to Communist invasion.</p>
                    <p>When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had concluded
                        his comments, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> called on
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> for his.</p>
                    <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0215"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> pointed out that when
                        the Armistice in Korea had been established, this Administration immediately
                        took a look at what the United States must do to assist South Korea. There
                        had been a kind of understanding with the South Koreans that the United
                        States would provide a two-year program of assistance. Part of this U.S.
                        program involved the return of many of our divisions to the United States.
                        However, since South Korea wished to maintain a strong military position, it
                        had proceeded to build up its own <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                        divisions as our U.S. divisions returned home. The net result was that the
                        South Korean Army was now much too big and was too great a burden for the
                        South Korean economy to maintain. While we all agree that this <gloss
                            target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army should be reduced, we have never quite
                        stepped up to reducing the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military
                        establishment. It could easily be reduced by five divisions, although such a
                        course of action would involve the concurrent modernization of U.S. forces
                        remaining in Korea with the new weapons.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the subject of economic assistance to South Korea, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> emphasized the poverty of
                        natural resources in South Korea. There was in addition another problem
                        connected with our assistance programs. <gloss target="#t_WHO1">Who</gloss>
                        was to own the facilities created in South Korea with our assistance funds?
                        If we left them all to be owned by the Government, we would have created in
                        South Korea the same kind of economic system which prevails now in the
                        Soviet Union. Yet it was extremely difficult to develop a private enterprise
                        economy in that country. This added problem needed study.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> closed his comments
                        with the suggestion that the United States should cut about $50 million or
                        $70 million, or somewhere between five and ten percent, from the $750
                        million which we now provided Korea annually in the shape of U.S. military
                        and economic assistance. We should also attempt to cut by degrees the
                        current <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force levels.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> then invited the comments
                        of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> referred in the first instance to
                        the charts at the back of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/5, and
                        informed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> that since they
                        provided statistics for the fiscal years 1956 and 1957 only, they did not
                        provide a real picture. In order to have a true picture, these statistics
                        should go back to the year 1950. Moreover, continued Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, Korea was a special case. The
                        United States could not force the South Koreans to reduce the level of their
                        armed forces unless we could provide them with good military reasons for
                        doing so. After all, the capital of South Korea, Seoul, was close to the
                        border with North Korea and was in constant danger of being overrun. Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> added that he felt
                        considerable sympathy for these South Korean people “sitting under the
                        guns”. If, on the other hand, we had in place in Korea defensive nuclear <pb
                            n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0216"/>weapons, so that the South Koreans
                        could actually see them, they might be impelled to reduce the level of their
                        own military forces.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> also pointed out that
                        there was a front line 150 miles in length defended by the armed forces of
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and of South Korea. The North Korean
                        Communists were constantly trying to infiltrate through this line and were
                        often successful. According to General Lemnitzer, 14 divisions were needed
                        to maintain this front. Moreover, if we withdrew the remaining two U.S.
                        divisions from South Korea, President Rhee might insist that a Korean
                        commander or a Korean deputy commander should run the whole military show in
                        South Korea. Thus our two U.S. divisions constituted a stabilizing force
                        against the possibility of a march by President Rhee against North Korea. If
                        these two divisions left South Korea and thereafter hostilities broke out
                        between the North Koreans and the South Koreans, there would be an unsolved
                        argument as to who had started the military action.</p>
                    <p>Turning from Korea to the over-all military picture, Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed out that our Government
                        did not have the maneuverability it ought to have because of the policies
                        followed and the commitments made by the previous Administrations. In
                        concluding, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said he
                        could not help but feel that the economic picture in the less developed
                        countries would be greatly improved if private capital from the West were
                        encouraged to enter these countries through the provision of guaranties by
                        the United States and other Western governments against losses through war
                        or serious political upheavals.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> then suggested that the
                        Council turn its attention to the second major problem of economic
                        development assistance, reading questions 2 and 3 as follows:</p>

                    </quote>
                    <p rend="flushleft">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> then
                        asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> if he would
                        care to comment on the second question.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that if one
                        could assume that the political situation is not further seriously
                        disturbed, he could see no reason why U.S. expenditures for long-term
                        economic development should increase. Indeed, it might be possible to reduce
                        these levels. Of course, he pointed out, there are certain new emerging
                        areas of need, such as Africa. This might change the picture, although <pb
                            n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0217"/>perhaps something could be done in
                        Africa through the use of private capital.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> commented that one of
                        the most difficult problems we face is that when areas of new need open up,
                        we do not reduce the level of our aid expenditures in the older areas.
                        Inevitably, therefore, the level of our expenses increases.</p>
                    <p>Pointing out that we had managed a significant shift of our economic
                        assistance from Europe to Asia in recent years, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> suggested that other shifts could be
                        made in the future. The President commented that Europe represented a rather
                        different problem since our economic assistance there was provided primarily
                        to restore the war-damaged economy of Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said that he was, of
                        course, depressed by the two or three small countries—Korea, Taiwan and
                        Vietnam—which accounted for the bulk of U.S. assistance. What we were doing
                        in these countries was, of course, to “maintain military symbols”. But this
                        did not result in building up their economies. Admittedly we needed these
                        military symbols; but how could we maintain the military symbols and still
                        carry out reasonable economic development programs. The President warned
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> that we could not
                        weigh our assistance programs solely in terms of the U.S. budget. We must
                        weigh these programs against the objectives which the United States was
                        seeking in the world—such as peace, security, the development of
                        international trade, and the like. The President added that he had come to
                        look on such countries as Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam as areas from which we
                        will get no positive return from our investment. We put the money into these
                        countries because we needed to maintain the status quo in the world and not
                        permit it to be upset against our national interests.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> replied that,
                        nevertheless, if we could only solve the problem of the costs of maintaining
                        these military symbols, two-thirds of our money could be freed for more
                        fruitful uses. The President said that he could not deny this, but did not
                        see how it could be accomplished until some real settlement with Russia had
                        been reached.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> repeated his
                        recommendation that we just cut a little—say five or ten percent—from each
                        assistance program each year. We should “pluck a few feathers”. The
                        President replied that if we looked the world straight in the face today we
                        would quickly realize that we could not throw down the burdens which we are
                        carrying in Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President asked if he might have the floor, and said that perhaps he
                        would find himself in a minority with respect to his answer to the second
                        question. He said he was referring specifically <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186"
                            facs="0218"/>to the portion of our resources that we were expending to
                        assist Asia, Africa and Latin America. With these areas in mind—and even
                        taking into account Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’
                        view that if we shift from grants to loans our total expenditures may
                        recede—The Vice President said that he remained very doubtful. Moreover, if
                        we have in mind that in the years ahead in these three areas there will be a
                        tendency to look either to the U.S. or the USSR in choosing the path to be
                        followed, The Vice President said he believed it was foolish to imagine that
                        the total amount of economic assistance needed by these areas from the
                        United States was going to go down. On the contrary, it was going to go up.
                        This aid might not necessarily be grant aid, but the general level of our
                        assistance expenditures would rise. In short, a substantial increase is
                        necessary over the next ten years, though perhaps private investment would
                        offer some help.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that it was the policy of this Administration to
                        make use of private capital as far as possible to assist such
                        under-developed areas. The Vice President said he realized this, but
                        predicted, nevertheless, that the total cost to the United States would go
                        up substantially over the next ten years. Moreover, if loans or private
                        capital were not available in sufficient quantities, U.S. grant aid would
                        have to make up the deficit.</p>
                    <p>The President said it would be interesting if anybody knew how much foreign
                        capital had been invested in the United States a century or so ago. He bet
                        that in any case it was very considerable. Accordingly, investment in newly
                        developing lands was no historical novelty. It was simply that the actions
                        of the Soviet Union made such investment now much more urgent.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> complained that of
                        course in our assistance programs we were not actually investing capital in
                        these newly developing areas. We were giving it away. This, indeed, was a
                        novelty in our history.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that we
                        were making every effort now to make greater use of private capital and of
                        loans rather than of grant aid. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> added that he could find nothing to dissent from in
                        The Vice President’s previous analysis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> then inquired whether
                        anyone dissented from the third question in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 5707/5 as set forth above. The President replied promptly
                        that no one could dissent from admitting the need to increase the emphasis
                        and resources devoted to training indigenous leaders in the less developed
                        countries. There was, however, one word of caution. As we developed leaders
                        in these new countries, we had got to be sure that we provided jobs for
                        these leaders and something for them to lead.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> invited the Council’s
                        attention at this point to the next major problem, Sino-Soviet economic
                        diplomacy, which he read as follows:</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">“III. Sino-Soviet Economic

                            should we seek to counter Sino-Soviet economic penetration, and by what
                            means?”</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> pointed out that this was
                        such a difficult problem that he had created a special committee of the
                            <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> to take, as it were, a census of
                        the weapons and measures now available in the U.S. armory to counter
                        Sino-Soviet economic penetration. It was proposed to study this problem
                        intensively in the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>, but Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> added that he would heartily
                        welcome any guidance on the problem from the National Security Council.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                            >Randall</persName> was likely to meet a lot of silence from the Council
                        on this subject, because we were obliged to decide on our reaction to each
                        individual Soviet measure of economic penetration. After all, said the
                        President, the Soviets have the inner lines and can move at will to confront
                        us with problems and difficulties. Accordingly, a lot of this would have to
                        be “played by ear”.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that it was his
                        impression that in this area of Sino-Soviet economic penetration the United
                        States really did not have to counter a massive Soviet effort in terms of
                        money and resources. His reason, continued Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, was his belief that the Soviets do
                        not actually have the monetary resources to finance great assistance
                        projects in the under-developed areas throughout the Free World. As proof of
                        this he cited the failure of the Soviet Union to make good its boast to
                        build the High Aswan Dam for Egypt in the event that the United States
                        refused to do so. Another instance was the manner in which the Soviets had
                        welshed on their big assistance program for Yugoslavia. Obviously, continued
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, the Soviets are
                        encountering serious troubles at home and terrible problems in the
                        satellites. All this was in addition to the heavy armaments burden that they
                        were obliged to carry. So, in his opinion, he said, the Russian penetration
                        did not really involve the capability of supplying large funds; it was
                        mostly a propaganda operation. Thus they had skillfully made use of trade
                        fairs to lure under-developed countries to choose the Communist path in
                        order to achieve their economic objectives. This would have to be
                        countered.</p>
                    <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0220"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> commented that, judging
                        from what he had observed at Bangkok recently, the U.S. contribution to the
                        trade fairs was proving very effective. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                            >Allen Dulles</persName> pointed out that we were certainly in a
                        position to do much more by way of debunking Soviet economic diplomacy.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>, however, pointed
                        out that Congress has already cut out half the money which the
                        Administration had asked for in order to carry out our program for trade
                        fairs in foreign countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> then turned to the next

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that it
                        would certainly cost this country less if we undertook to pay rent for base
                        rights in these countries instead of providing a mutual assistance program.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that we
                        really faced a choice of evils in this situation, but on the whole he felt
                        that the payment of rent was the lesser of the evils. If we did not shift to
                        a rental basis we would never be able to get off the wicket of grant aid and
                        onto the basis of loans in our mutual security assistance programs. With
                        this position Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said
                        he agreed. The President expressed the hope that perhaps one day the United
                        States would confront a buyer’s market on bases. He said he was certainly
                        fed up with the situation now facing us.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> pointed out that the
                        Council had exceeded its time on this paper, and asked the Council to look
                        at the final problem, on economic assistance to satellite nations, which

                    <p>The President observed that we certainly ought to ask Congress to relax these
                        legal restrictions, but he doubted that we could induce Congress to agree to
                        such relaxation. The Vice President agreed that this action should be
                        undertaken at some point, but we should not ask Congress to relax these
                        restrictions at the present time. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> agreed with this judgment, and The Vice President
                        went on to explain that before these restrictions could be relaxed there
                        would have to be a preparation of the American people and direct contact
                        between Administration leaders and members of Congress to explain and
                        justify the relaxation.</p>

                    <p rend="center">MUTUAL SECURITY PROGRAM—BIPARTISAN MEETING</p>
                    <p>(The following is the gist of the President’s opening statement as
                        reconstructed following the meeting. It is not to be regarded as verbatim
                        text.)</p>
                    <p>It is clear that our budget is primarily a military matter, for almost $41
                        billion of it is devoted to defense items. And that figure is not one to be
                        thought of as having been recklessly conceived. The Services gave their
                        agreement to the level of $38.5 billion only after <pb n="191"
                            xml:id="pg_191" facs="0223"/>the most agonizing of studies and after
                        planning for a good many months.</p>
                    <p>What do we get for that vast sum? Only the policeman on the corner to see
                        that the robber doesn’t get into our house. There is even a question if it
                        is enough. Of one thing you can be certain, military programs already began
                        and approved by the Congress will have a greatly increased cost in the years
                        ahead, there is no doubt of that.</p>
                    <p>We must do something to neutralize the threat which faces us. For two
                        reasons, a democratic country like ours cannot depend solely on building a
                        fortress and retiring within it—tiredness or weariness will eventually set
                        in or we get controls that nobody wants; or we will be finally hemmed in by
                        a ring of unfriendly countries that have been taken over by Communists or
                        seduced to their side.</p>
                    <p>We cannot just sit and wait for something to happen to eliminate the threat.
                        The best that we can hope to happen is the deterioration of the Communist
                        system as a result of internal unrest or of revolts in the satellites. But
                        those things won’t happen if we merely sit behind an array of planes and
                        guns and tanks. This is not a static world. It is extremely dynamic, marked
                        especially by the growing force of nationalism which I consider even
                        stronger than Communism. We are all agreed, I am sure, though we may differ
                        in regard to methods or details, that we must wage peace. We can’t wage
                        peace just from the pulpit. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> and I are engaged constantly and earnestly in
                        studying practical steps by which we can improve the international
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>I would be the last to say that we have reached a final or complete answer on
                        how to do this. However, all of the many groups who have studied the matter,
                        and Congress has also made studies, have come to the conclusion that this
                        so-called foreign aid is misnamed. It should be designated rather as an
                        investment for peace—an investment that does, of course, require some amount
                        of sacrifice. If mistakes have been made, as I am sure some must have been,
                        in this effort, at least the mistakes are reckoned in dollars and not in
                        lives.</p>
                    <p>The program that we’ve settled upon after intensive consideration is one
                        providing both direct military programs and economic programs costing
                        together less than $4 billion. Since my Budget Message, the Department of
                        Defense has been able to find areas for savings of about $500 million that
                        bring the total down to $3.(80) billion. Now this is just about 7% of the
                        strictly military items in the budget, and it is only about 15% of what
                        those countries which we assist will themselves be spending. It is the
                        military assistance part of mutual security that I mean when I say 7% and
                        15%.</p>

                    <p>As for the economic part, one of the great difficulties we have had is that
                        there is too much rigidity in the operation of it. We have to plan specific
                        programs and projects before enactment of the bill, we have to justify them
                        to the Congress, and during all this the countries concerned develop a
                        feeling of having a vested right to the full amount that has been discussed.
                        We need much greater flexibility as to the timing of these projects and as
                        to deciding on them, so that they can be determined exactly at the moment
                        developments occur that warrant them. For instance, I am certain the
                        Secretary of State believes that the $10 million we were able to give Jordan
                        was what kept that country in being, as it helped to enable that gallant
                        young King to keep control.</p>
                    <p>Unless we succeed in finding a way to reduce the threat, we cannot reasonably
                        expect to accomplish substantial reductions in the budget. Of course, if it
                        were possible to eliminate our farm programs or stop the grants to the
                        States or end the Federal assistance given for (disasters) or reduce the
                        benefits authorized for veterans, some money could be saved. But I think all
                        of us here are too realistic to think that great savings can be made in
                        those programs. Otherwise, great savings will be made only in the defense
                        area—and that can be done only at great risk to our security until the
                        threat is reduced. Just last year Congress put more money into defense
                        programs. I did not oppose that—the Congress has a responsibility and also
                        experience, and we know that these are very “nice” judgments that are made
                        in setting expenditures at any particular level.</p>
                    <p>This military assistance program, I repeat, is 7% of what we put into things
                        that are negative and sterile in that they are not producing items for
                        public consumption. Over and above that, there are economic programs
                        amounting to $1 billion, eighty million. (The President then repeated the
                        amounts in response to a question from Speaker <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                            >Rayburn</persName>.)</p>
                    <p>I would rather see anything else in the budget cut than these programs for
                        waging peace, including both the economic and the military parts of our
                        Mutual Security program, our Information program, and our State Department
                        programs. They are all parts of a parcel that we just must not neglect.</p>
                    <p>Now, I am asking the Secretary of State to set forth the details of this
                        proposal.</p>

                            >Dulles</persName> said that it was very apparent, in the meetings he
                        had attended in Asia and Europe, how important is the United States to the
                        existence of the treaty organizations; indeed, these would fall apart if the
                        U.S. effort appeared to be diminishing, and the Communists would be able to
                        achieve their goal of encirclement of the U.S. Should that happen, the cost
                        of our defense would increase greatly.</p>
                    <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0225"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> informed the Leaders that
                        the Mutual Security Program would be presented to the Congress in a
                        different way this year so as to segregate the defense items more from the
                        economic. A total of $2.8 billion, to be appropriated to the President,
                        would be requested for the defense items: $1.9 billion for “Hardware” and
                        $.9 billion for Defense Support, to enable such countries as Viet Nam,
                        Korea, Turkey, and others to maintain armed forces at a level their
                        economies could not alone support. This does not cover any long term
                        economic aid, merely short-term and immediate things. The hardware program
                        will be administered by <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss>, the other by
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>; and both will be under the broad
                        policy guidance of the President and Secretary of State. This grouping
                        permits a more effective presentation and justification.</p>
                    <p>In the economic part of the program, for which $1 billion would be asked, the
                        most novel item is the creation of the Development Loan Fund to allow “soft”
                        loans (repayable in local currencies and interest-free for necessary
                        periods) designed to increase the economic potential of the countries
                        involved. It is in our interest to do this by loans, even soft ones, rather
                        than outright grant because the obligation to repay would encourage greater
                        care by the recipient countries in the selection of projects. For the <gloss
                            target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>, a request would be made for $500 million
                        for appropriation this year, and for authority to borrow from Treasury up to
                        $750 million in each of the coming two years.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stressed the ability for
                        development that capitalist societies must have; if they are not dynamic, if
                        they do not hold hope for development, these new nations will turn to the
                        communist system.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then outlined the remainder of the program: $155 million for
                        the Technical Cooperation Program, $125 million for miscellaneous programs,
                        and $300 million for the Emergency Grant Assistance fund. Of the $300
                        million item, $100 million was already programmed, and $200 million would be
                        kept for emergencies yet to appear.</p>
                    <p>Concluding his statement, <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that the Administration is
                        aware of the fact that operation of the Mutual Security Program has not been
                        perfect, and that an appearance of discrediting it could be given by seizing
                        on little things here and there. His own feeling was that it is a wonder we
                        do as well as we have—any organization of this sort is bound to have
                        defects. But to try to discredit it is to take a very false view; this is
                        needed critically for waging peace, and you don’t cut off the ammunition
                        from a soldier in the field simply because some of his shots miss their
                        target. He asked the Leaders to consider Iran: it was virtually under
                        Communist control a few years ago but is now a strong ally. Our work there
                            <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0226"/>was not done in the most
                        efficient way, but it was done. The Administration certainly doesn’t claim
                        perfection in all this, but it does claim that the demonstrated results are
                        worth so much more than the dollars put in that it would be folly, as the
                        President pointed out before, to do away with the program. It constitutes
                        10% of our security budget, but to do away with it would decrease our
                        security by a lot more than 10%.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> then read a statement on
                        the importance of Mutual Security, touching on Communist efforts, on the
                        fact that 75% of the Program is military in nature, and on the need for
                        putting more of our economic assistance on a loan basis. He noted how the
                        needs of the world are limitless while our resources are limited; hence the
                        need to set priorities. He voiced the opinion that through the military
                        aspects of the program, Korea, Taiwan and Viet Nam had been saved from
                        communism, as had also Thailand, Guatemala and perhaps Jordan through its
                        economic aspects.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> said the Administration
                        would request that Military Assistance be a continuing authorization unless
                        cancelled by Congressional action, and that appropriations be on a “no year”
                        basis, and that similar provisions be made for Defense Support and for the
                        Development Loan Fund. For Technical Cooperation, funds appropriated should
                        remain available on a fifteen month basis. He pointed out that the Special
                        (Emergency) Assistance funds were intended to be used in countries where we
                        do not have a military alliance and where a Development grant or loan would
                        not be appropriate. These would be mostly grants, but loans would not be
                        precluded. He then compared the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ’57 and
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ’58 programs—of approximately equal
                        size—noting that the defense items dropped from 82% to 72% of the total,
                        resulting from experience this year and from the intent to handle some
                        things through the Development Loan Fund that are being done in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ’57 through Defense Support.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_Sen1">Sen.</gloss> Johnson inquired why it was necessary to
                        increase the contingency fund. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"
                            >Hollister</persName> replied that the increase was not large, and would
                        have to cover some items that no longer would fall in the loan category or
                        military programs. <gloss target="#t_Sen1">Sen.</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KW1">Knowland</persName> ascertained that <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 funds were not included in this
                        presentation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> explained the difficulty
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> had in getting projects planned and
                        funds allocated within a short span of time or having those funds lapse.
                        They had the dilemma, he said, of being criticized either for long delays in
                        approvals or for committing projects without a sound basis. He said the
                        agency hopes to make loans in a way that would also encourage a greater flow
                        of private capital to desirable projects. He noted that the International
                        Bank and the <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">Ex-Im Bank</gloss> make only
                        “hard” loans, and that it would be necessary to coordinate closely the
                            <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> with those so it doesn’t <pb n="195"
                            xml:id="pg_195" facs="0227"/>infringe on the “hard” loan area. He
                        pointed out <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>’s hope to get away from
                        “country” programs since these are less flexible and are difficult to reduce
                        after a country comes to think it has a vested right to a certain program
                        level.</p>
                    <p>Regarding Military Assistance, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1"
                            >Sprague</persName> said our programs have been adequate, that the need
                        for them continues, that our allies have increased their forces and
                        effectiveness, and that <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> is convinced our
                        assistance programs must be kept up-to-date and improved. With the aid of
                        some charts, he showed the areas of communist activity since 1946, military
                        and economic, and how our assistance program and overseas base activities
                        are geographically related to the threat. He confirmed <gloss
                            target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>’ earlier statement that withdrawal of our assistance
                        would cause the breakdown of our treaty arrangements—<gloss

                            the 1951 Security Treaty signed by Australia, New Zealand, and the
                            United States. For text of the defense agreement, see Department of

                        etc. He stressed that our national security is strengthened at relatively
                        low cost by these arrangements. At the request of Senators <persName
                            corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Wiley</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KW1"
                            >Knowland</persName>, he gave some statistics on the low cost of
                        equipping and paying a Turkish soldier in contrast with that for a U.S.
                        soldier. He also compared the security expenditures and accomplishments of
                        the U.S. and of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies between
                        1950 and 1956, concluding that it is impossible to estimate what it would
                        have cost the U.S. to accomplish what the Allies have done, indeed it would
                        be almost inconceivable that the U.S. could have done it at any cost.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> then noted how our
                        assistance program has shifted from Europe (now only 25% of the total)
                        towards the Far East. He also stated that the carryover for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ’58, as figured in January, would be $4.4
                        billion, NOA would be $2.4 billion, expenditures $2.2 billion, leaving a
                        carryover of $4.6 billion for ’59. However, Defense has been working to
                        reduce the carryover and it now appears, he said, that NOA need be only $1.9
                        billion. The $500 million reduction would be accomplished through improved
                        planning, screening, funding, better administration generally, and—in terms
                        of matériel—savings in ammunition, spare parts, and consumables.</p>
                    <p>85% of the military assistance money is spent within the United States, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> said.</p>
                    <p>Rep. Cannon noted that the Russians are said to have the second-largest Navy;
                        he wondered if that meant in numbers or in effectiveness. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> said it pertained to numbers, and
                        he deferred to any <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> view there might be
                        about effectiveness.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_Sen1">Sen.</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RRB2">Russell</persName> said he was impressed by the
                        $500 million saving accomplished, and he asked whether comparable savings
                        might be <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0228"/>made in the whole $38.5
                        billion Defense budget, thus solving most of the present fiscal problem. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that the Mutual
                        Security savings stemmed mostly from the time period involved, and that this
                        program was finally being brought into the same better management program
                        that had already been in effect for some time in the <gloss target="#t_DOD1"
                            >DoD</gloss> budget effort. It had lagged, as regards Mutual Security,
                        primarily because of the difficulty of the spare parts problem. The
                        President explained further that as the U.S. adopts new equipment, the need
                        for spare parts decreases, whereas the older equipment then gets used in
                        other areas and spare parts are needed there. <gloss target="#t_Sen1"

                        <persName corresp="#p_RRB2">Russell</persName> commented that that aspect of
                        the program had always been primarily a bookkeeping transaction, so that
                        really it was just a matter of marking down those items. The President
                        replied that he had not regarded it that way. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> said that most of the $500 million
                        was made up of “one-shot” savings. <gloss target="#t_Sen1">Sen.</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RRB2">Russell</persName> rejoined that he hoped the
                        “better management” of which <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>
                        spoke would not be a “one-shot” item.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KW1">Knowland</persName> ascertained from Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> that the unexpended
                        balances on the economic side of the program had been running at about the
                        same level for the past three years. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                            >Taber</persName> referred to an unexpended balance of $500 million this
                        year and asked why it had not been obligated—wasn’t it really needed? Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> stated it resulted from
                        the various savings that had been developed without harm to the program. He
                        said also that the carryover as a whole was now reduced just about to a
                        minimum, and that it couldn’t go down more because modern weapons have a
                        long leadtime.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Saltonstall</persName> inquired about the effect
                        the “soft” loans of the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> would have on
                        the International Bank and the <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">Ex-Im
                            Bank</gloss>, both of which had to require repayment in hard currencies.
                            <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> said that would necessitate great care in
                        coordinating the two types of loans, but that it was not difficult to
                        distinguish which type of loan should be used for a particular project. The
                        real problem, <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> felt, would be whether to make an
                        outright grant or a loan. He thought it better generally to make loans, but
                        in either event there would be problems. The President cited the merits of
                        “soft” loans when used in ways to build up a country’s economy, thus leading
                        to the time when “hard” loans would be feasible. <gloss target="#t_Sec1"
                            >Sec</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> felt some
                        projects might be financed partly by “soft” loans and partly by “hard”, with
                        the latter representing the equity in the project. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> said some of this splitting had
                        already been done by <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> stated the interest of
                        many in Congress with improving efficiency and ending overlapping. He asked
                        why funds <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0229"/>might not be appropriated
                        direct to Defense and to State, putting an end to <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                            >ICA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The President replied on how the Administration had been worrying this
                        subject since 1953, carrying out two complete reorganizations thus far. The
                        essential thing, he said, was to keep it under the general policy guidance
                        of State; other than that, he was ready to confer with the Leaders at any
                        time on this particular, for he was heartily in favor of any method that
                        would bring greater economy and an improved working together.</p>
                    <p>Rep. <persName corresp="#p_VJM1">Vorys</persName> expressed his opinion that
                        the way things stood now pretty much completed the reorganization work
                        needed in this area.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired as to the best time for transmitting the Special
                        Message on this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> thought
                        either of the next two days, when the House would be in session, would be
                        satisfactory. <gloss target="#t_Sen1">Sen.</gloss> Johnson had no particular
                        time to recommend.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_Sen1">Sen.</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> recalled that in connection
                        with the Mid-East Resolution<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3">Presumably the

                            unanimously by the General Assembly, February 28, 1957; for text, see

                        proposals were to be brought to the attention of Congress; he wondered if
                        this would be true of the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> said they had not done any
                        planning for such a procedure, that he doubted that Congress would want to
                        go into every project under the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>, and
                        that it would cause undesirable delay in deferring action on projects until
                        after Congress could study them. He thought further light on this question
                        could be had later, after the first year of experience.</p>
                    <p>The meeting then concluded with Speaker <persName corresp="#p_RS1"

                        reached his discussion of trends which could be perceived after analysis of
                        the charts and data which he had presented, the President expressed surprise
                        that we were apparently asking for less money for the mutual security
                        programs in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 than we had earlier
                        agreed that we needed.</p>

                        on the development loan fund, The Vice President inquired whether we had not
                        previously argued, in defense of this development loan fund, that it
                        involved an increased trend toward loans for foreign assistance coupled with
                        a decrease in grant assistance.</p>
                    <p>(At this point the President temporarily left the meeting.)</p>
                    <p>The Vice President continued by pointing out that we must make this point
                        clear to the Congress because the totals for our military and economic
                        assistance remained about the same, and this would require explanation to
                        the Congress.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJHJ1">James Smith</persName>, the Director of
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, predicted that loans would probably
                        be down in the next fiscal year, and that grants would remain about the
                        same.</p>
                    <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0231"/>
                    <p>(At this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> also
                        left the meeting.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then said that Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJHJ1">Smith</persName> wished to make a statement at this
                        point. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJHJ1">Smith</persName> explained that he
                        wished to speak to the economic rather than the military side of the mutual
                        security program. He pointed out Khrushchev’s challenge to the United States
                        some three weeks ago, and Khrushchev’s statement that the Soviet Union would
                        soon surpass the United States in competition in the field of peaceful
                        production. There was clear evidence, continued Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJHJ1">Smith</persName>, that Khrushchev has put this
                        program to work. After citing various instances of Soviet assistance and
                        activities in the underdeveloped countries, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJHJ1"
                            >Smith</persName> also pointed out the role of Communist China and the
                        Satellites. He also listed briefly what assistance was being given by the
                        Soviet Union to non-Satellite nations in terms of credits or other forms of
                        assistance. He believed that this economic competition from the Soviet Bloc
                        posed a very serious challenge to the United States and the Free World. He
                        accordingly said he strongly supported the figures just presented by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> for the Mutual Security
                        Program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>s 1957, 1958 and 1959. Beyond
                        this, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJHJ1">Smith</persName> recommended that the
                        United States call for the establishment of a long-term international
                        economic corps for peace, whose function would be to assist the
                        less-developed nations. The National Security Council must respond to the
                        challenge offered by Khrushchev.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJHJ1">Smith</persName> had finished his
                        statement, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> reverted to the
                        question he had posed at the end of his presentation—namely, the
                        desirability of asking the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff to undertake a study with respect to our military assistance programs
                        in the period 1960–65. He first asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1"
                            >Quarles</persName> to comment on the desirability of such a study.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that the
                        United States must certainly look ahead, but that there were very great
                        uncertainties in so doing. For example, we do not know what the Soviets will
                        be doing in the period 1960–65, although whatever they did would obviously
                        affect what we do. Another factor was the progressive improvement in the
                        economies of our allies and, accordingly, of the portion of the burden which
                        these allies could take over from the United States. Perhaps the best way to
                        approach such a study as that proposed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> would be to do it in terms of a probable range. In
                        any event, the Department of Defense would do its best in what would
                        certainly be a very complicated task.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that of course
                        he did not expect complete accuracy in a study covering future years, but
                        was seeking only general orders of magnitude. He then asked Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName>, as Acting Chairman of the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff, for his views on the feasibility of the proposed
                        study.</p>
                    <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0232"/>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> pointed out that it
                        would be very hard for the Joint Chiefs of Staff to produce anything very
                        meaningful. The assumptions chosen for such a study would almost certainly
                        provide the answer to the problem. In order to make a meaningful study we
                        would have to know more than we possibly could know about a great many
                        factors.</p>
                    <p>In view of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName>’s comments,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> wondered whether, instead
                        of calling for the study he proposed, the Council could ask the Department
                        of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to tell the Council what might be
                        accomplished in the way of a useful study.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President expressed doubts that anything useful could be anticipated
                        from the study proposed, and went on to state that it had occurred to him,
                        in looking at the charts and the data which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> had used, that the matter of greatest concern to the
                        United States in the future was where emphasis should be placed as between
                        military and economic assistance. In the first place, said The Vice
                        President, it seemed clear to him that the Soviet Union was now placing much
                        more emphasis on economic programs than it had previously done. From our own
                        standpoint, we must not allow ourselves to be so obsessed with the patterns
                        of the past that we were incapable of changing the pattern and changing the
                        emphasis. The Vice President believed that we must give much more thought
                        and attention to economic assistance and, wherever possible, less to
                        military assistance. He added that of course in certain countries, like
                        Korea and other areas where the Chiefs of Staff felt that military aid was
                        needed at a high level, we could not change this emphasis. On the other
                        hand, there seemed to be areas where we could increase our economic
                        assistance, and in general economic assistance was less costly than military
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> commented that the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff would agree with the point made by The Vice President.
                        The latter went on to observe that if we were not very careful in our
                        analysis of the facts and figures which had been presented today, there was
                        danger that we would continue in our old ruts and be unwilling to try out
                        any new paths. The economic side, he said, was the wave of the future.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> confirmed the view
                        that the Soviets were shifting emphasis to economic from military
                        assistance. He added that in many underdeveloped countries—such as Egypt and
                        Syria—the receipt of armament had reached, so to speak, the saturation
                        point. Such countries had already received larger armaments than they could
                        effectively support or use.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Quarks commented that, along the lines suggested by The Vice
                        President, and as one analyzed our military assistance <pb n="201"
                            xml:id="pg_201" facs="0233"/>programs, one finds that a large part of
                        the pressure for military assistance from foreign countries derived from
                        local tensions and local conditions rather than as a response to our great
                        problem of containing Communism. To Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1"
                            >Quarles</persName> this meant that the United States should make a
                        greater effort to quiet down local tensions. If we succeeded in doing this
                        we would be able to cut down on our military assistance programs and
                        increase the amounts available for economic assistance.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President commented that another factor which had always tended to
                        emphasize our military assistance programs over our economic assistance
                        programs, was the comparative ease of selling our policy of military
                        assistance to the American people and the Congress, and the difficulty of
                        selling our program of economic aid.</p>
                    <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> suggested that
                        the Council request the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        to see what they could suggest in the way of a study and report to the
                        Council before they actually undertake any study.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out that in
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> today the United States was going to
                        propose a greatly expanded technical assistance fund for economic
                        development.</p>
                    <p>(The President returned to the meeting at this time, 10:30 a.m.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">George Allen</persName>, Director of the U.S.
                        Information Agency, said he felt that many people in the world believe that
                        all our answers to world problems are military answers. This was a mistaken
                        view which we must nevertheless correct. At present we give too many
                        opportunities to Soviet propaganda describing us as warmongers. To
                        illustrate his point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> read
                        excerpts from a speech which was being made today by the Secretary of Labor.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> pointed out that he was far
                        from insisting that the public relations factor was the governing factor;
                        but it was certainly an important factor.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that in terms of our setting forth our military
                        capabilities before the world, we were damned if we did and damned if we
                        didn’t. He was not sure that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1"
                            >Allen</persName>’s point was correct. The problem was how to inform our
                        own people in a logical way of our military capabilities, without at the
                        same time scaring our allies to death.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> replied that there was even
                        an unfortunate impression going around abroad that the President was going
                        to the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting in order to
                        beg our allies to permit us to station atomic weapons on their soil. The
                        President answered that this, of course, was completely erroneous. We were
                        only trying to assure our allies of our support if they were attacked.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President, addressing the President, said that the President could
                        give assurance on the score of our strength in very <pb n="202"
                            xml:id="pg_202" facs="0234"/>short order at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> meeting. But it also seemed to The Vice President that the
                        great appeal that the President exerts in the world today is that he was
                        considered to be a man of peace. Accordingly, The Vice President thought
                        that the President’s greatest contribution would consist in a re-affirmation
                        of the peaceful objectives and purposes of the United States. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that he could not agree
                        more.</p>

                    <p>I want to express to you my deep concern over the few strategic trade control
                        problems which, despite the close cooperation of our two governments on
                        these matters, are unresolved. The problems to which I refer are in essence
                        the hard core of separate issues remaining from last summer’s negotiations
                        which resulted in broad agreement <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0236"
                        />among the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> countries on a greatly
                        curtailed list of strategic items. They relate specifically to the control
                        of rolling mills, electric generators and ship sales, to which must be added
                        the new problem of great concern with reference to copper wire and
                        cable.</p>
                    <p>I will not burden you with the detailed aspects of these problems which have
                        been and can continue to be capably handled by Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TP1">Thorneycroft</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>. Rather, I wish to emphasize my
                        hope and expectation that, despite the difficulties, parliamentary and
                        otherwise, which, in different ways, we both face, we can attach paramount
                        weight to the strategic factors presented by these problems, i.e., the
                        relation of the particular items to military security, and the necessity of
                        prompt agreement on these pending issues to preserve the working
                        effectiveness of the institutional arrangements which we and other friendly
                        countries have supported in our mutual security interests. I appreciate that
                        the denial of any specific shipments does not in itself assure our security,
                        but failure adequately to limit certain items can contribute dangerously to
                        the build-up of the Soviet war-making potential, and I believe that these
                        particular goods should not move to the Soviets in such quantities as to
                        constitute a real contribution to the potential military strength of the
                        Soviet bloc. I am also convinced that by failure to resolve our differences,
                        we endanger the continued existence and effectiveness of the multilateral
                        organization in Paris which has been set up to deal with the whole program
                        of security trade controls. There is a further element which I know you
                        especially will appreciate. That element is my apprehension that avoidable,
                        but dangerous, frictions in Anglo-American relations could result from
                        delivery to the Soviets of such sensitive items as these to an extent which,
                        frankly speaking, the Executive Branch of my government would find it
                        difficult to justify in security terms to our Congress and people.</p>

                                Intelligence and the Deputy Director for Intelligence, The Joint
                                Staff, believe that any approach to the problem of relaxation of
                                trade controls should be viewed in the light of over-all Communist
                                objectives, and specifically the attitude and actions of Communist
                                China toward the US and the other Free World nations. They therefore

                                following be inserted ahead of the present first Conclusion of this
                                estimate:</p>
                            <p>“There is no indication that the fundamental hostility of the
                                Communists toward the Free World has abated, nor that, in pursuit of
                                their ultimate objectives, the Communist program of attaining
                                self-sufficiency within the Bloc at a high level of military and
                                industrial development has changed. Moscow and Peiping almost
                                certainly estimate that the qualitative and quantitative gains,
                                which would ensue from increased trade with the Free World, will
                                accelerate this planned expansion of their economies, as well as
                                provide opportunities for political gain through economic
                                penetration. We do not believe that any relaxation of controls on
                                trade with Communist China will lessen this hostility, nor will it
                                tend to change the course of Communist China’s foreign policy.”

                        <item>China’s objective of creating an industrialized and militarily
                            powerful state cannot be achieved without extensive imports of capital
                            goods and military equipment. The rate of advance of China’s power
                            potential thus depends to a large degree on the volume of China’s
                            foreign trade. Except to the extent that the USSR extends grants or
                            credits, China’s capabilities to import will be limited by its
                            capabilities to export, (paras 1, 19)</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>China has been able to import from the European Bloc those
                            commodities, including transshipped Western goods, required for a rapid
                            expansion of military strength and achievement of industrial output
                            somewhat higher than previous peaks. It is committed to a program
                            integrating its economy with that of the Bloc, in consonance with the
                            Bloc policy of autarky. Nevertheless, at present, both Moscow and

                            it is probable that China’s import capabilities would be reduced
                            proportionately. Such a reduction in China’s imports would significantly
                            retard China’s internal development, (paras 45, 46)</item>

                        <item>The Director of Central Intelligence and the Special Assistant,
                            Intelligence, Department of State, believe that in the unlikely event
                            that all non-Bloc shipping and shipping services were denied to the uses
                            of Chinese commerce, the Chinese economy would in the short term be
                            adversely affected, and transportation costs increased. Non-Bloc
                            ocean-going vessels in 1953 carried about three-fourths of China’s
                            seaborne foreign trade. Bloc flag shipping is inadequate to carry its
                            own trade and no substantial building program is in progress. However, a
                            substantial share of China’s seaborne trade now carried in non-Bloc
                            vessels would be carried by the Trans-Siberian railroad and by Bloc flag
                            vessels diverted to the China trade, provided non-Bloc flag vessels were
                            chartered to replace the shipping so diverted. A considerable part of
                            the trade probably would be curtailed, notably China’s exports of coal
                            and iron ore which constitute 40 percent of seaborne export tonnage but
                            less than 1 percent of the value of total exports. These adjustments
                            would probably be made within a reasonable period. If denial affected
                            only <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> flag shipping and
                            services, the Chinese could shift at least part of their seaborne
                            commerce to non-<gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> flag
                            vessels, thus mitigating still further the effects described above,

                            Chinese economy would be marked and adverse. It is probable that only a
                            small portion of the tonnage now carried by non-Bloc ships could be
                            carried through an increase or readjustment in the use of Bloc shipping.
                            Denial of all non-Bloc shipping would result in considerable curtailment
                            of China’s foreign trade, because the rail transportation facilities
                            within China and those between China and the European Bloc probably are
                            not adequate to handle the additional tonnages involved. If denial
                            affected only <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> flag shipping
                            and services, the Chinese could shift at least part of their seaborne

                            thus mitigating the effects described above. We believe, however, that

                            largest maritime nations, in addition to other pressures which could be

                            substantial additional tonnage suitable for the China trade, and with

                        basis and giving appropriate recognition to particular economic and
                        political pressures within individual countries. The relaxation in controls
                        against the European Bloc took the form of net reductions in the number of
                        items or categories in the embargo, quota, and surveillance control lists by

                        differential between controls on trade with the European Bloc and controls
                        on trade with China, and therefore increased the opportunities for China to

                        with the various interested bureaus. It poses basic questions about our

                        It reviews the history of their genesis and elaboration. Although opinions
                        would differ within the Department upon the merits of this paper, or the
                        purposes it can properly serve, all are agreed that it is more or less

                        specific problems it attempts to formulate. It is the general view also in
                        this Department that an adequate approach to this policy review will require
                        time for assimilation by the Council of such pertinent materials as the
                        Intelligence Estimates and for preparation and study of more thorough and

                            Soviet Union, proposed that Nikolai Bulganin succeed Malenkov. The
                            Supreme Soviet approved Khrushchev’s recommendation and several other

                    <p>Recently there has been considerable press and other comment about the change
                        in economic policy by the Soviet Union. This was highlighted by the
                        resignation of Mr. <persName>Mikoyan</persName> as Minister of Trade,<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d47fn3">On January 24, Anastas I. Mikoyan resigned as
                            Minister of Trade.</note> and the subsequent announcements of Mr.
                            <persName>Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>It seems to be clearly indicated that the program of Mikoyan which promised a
                        rapidly rising standard of living, even at the expense of heavy industrial
                        expansion, has been reversed. This is supported by the 1955 budget of the
                        Soviet [Union] which shows sharp increases in appropriations for the armed
                        forces and heavy industry and cutbacks in allocations for consumer goods and
                        agriculture. The evident conclusion is a reallocation of their internal
                        resources. Apparently capital resources proved inadequate to meet the
                        ambitious plans for consumer goods expansion without seriously <pb n="217"
                            xml:id="pg_217" facs="0249"/>interfering with the expansion of heavy
                        industry and its inevitable relation to war production. As a result the
                        progress in living standards is set back.</p>
                    <p>This situation suggests implications with respect to East-West Trade Policy.
                        It seems to clearly indicate that the acquisition by means of trade of goods
                        and materials, whether acquired directly or through satellite nations, that
                        contribute to the maintenance or increase of their domestic living standards
                        becomes a more obvious replacement of the domestic resources diverted from
                        consumption purposes to war purposes.</p>
                    <p>The same factor is apparent with respect to Communist China and the diversion
                        of its internal resources to industrialization related to the growth of its

                        certain categories of food supplies for industrial equipment when there are

                            policy of the Soviet Union. Though Malenkov and Mikoyan never put butter

                            butter along with the guns. The <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0250"

                            friends more receptive to the U.S. position. On the other hand
                            increasing Russian intransigence and vociferous support for China on the

                            and the rest of the Bloc less and less rational. If in return for some

                            proposition: that is to say, a highly subtle distinction between various

                            potential is futile. The Russian industrial machine is so large that it
                            can make any substitution needed. Therefore, anything, e.g., a textile
                            spinning frame or shoe machine reequipment, which contributes to their
                            industrial potential contributes to their military potential and any
                            finished product frees their basic machinery to make end-items enhancing
                            their military potential.</item>

                            90,000 machine tools as compared to 70,000 produced in the U.S. Thus to
                            me it is hard to see how any control program can seriously impair Soviet

                        comments listed under “Recommendation” may be made if discussion is held on

                        <item>The burden of the subject memoranda is that the hardened domestic and
                            foreign attitude of the present Kremlin leaders renders obsolete and
                            futile the somewhat subtle distinction between “strategic” and
                            “non-strategic” goods, as far as the free world denial program is
                            concerned. Also, the differential in the levels of international
                            security trade controls as between the European Soviet bloc and
                            Communist China is now even more illogical than it has been. Policywise,
                            as far as the U.S. is concerned, the implication seems to be that we
                            should seek a uniform level of controls against both parts of the Soviet
                            bloc at a point somewhere between the levels now in effect for the
                            European Soviet bloc on the one hand and Communist China on the

                        <item>Within a small circle of the Economic Defense Advisory Committee
                            (EDAC) organization, thought is being given to a new approach to the
                            problem of formulating an improved control list for the Communist bloc.
                            The principle underlying this new approach, if it can be worked out over
                            the next several months, would be control of those items, or categories
                            of items, the denial of which would impose the greatest calculated cost
                            to the Soviet bloc measured in economic resources. The proposal might
                            not work a great change in the ultimate appearance of the actual control
                            lists, but would support them with a sounder rationale than the existing
                            “strategic” criteria which the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                            countries accept but which prove to be subject to differing
                            interpretations.</item>

                        <item>If and when some such proposal has been formulated and agreed upon
                            within the U.S. Government, the remaining question would be whether the
                            new approach could or should be negotiated in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss>. Without prejudice to this question, we shall
                            certainly have to keep in mind the fact that, even at the height of the
                            Korean conflict, our European allies were not willing to accept measures
                            aimed at the general economic well-being of the Soviet Union and its
                            European satellites. They were unwilling, moreover, to levy a total
                            embargo against Communist China, the declared aggressor, even though a
                            number of them had troops on the Korean battlefield.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>A case can be made that the Soviet bloc, including China, benefits
                            more from East-West trade than does the West. If this is accepted, and
                            the reasoning in the subject memoranda is carried to a logical
                            conclusion, then the answer from a narrow economic security standpoint
                            is simple and clear-cut: total embargo. From the broader standpoint of
                            our national interests, and having in mind the health and vitality of
                            our political and military alliances, the game would not be worth the
                            candle, particularly since the “game” is not believed capable of
                            weakening the bloc in any vital way.</item>

                        <item>At no time during the Malenkov regime was it ever implied that
                            consumers’ goods or agriculture had higher priority than heavy industry,
                            nor was performance in light industries ever of a nature or on a scale
                            to constitute a shift from the traditional concentration on heavy
                            industry. The goals for heavy industry in this period were not scaled
                            down, and investments in this sector continued high. Similarly, recently
                            announced economic objectives indicate no sharp increase in effort in
                            the heavy industry field—which was already being fostered to an extreme
                            degree—at the expense of consumers’ goods—which as a matter of fact,
                            offered little room for a squeezing operation.</item>

                            extremely difficult, if not impossible, to assess the contribution of
                            individual commodities to the Soviet bloc war or civilian economy. Our
                            lists of so-called strategic goods, in the absence of satisfactory
                            intelligence on the bloc economy, frequently have had to be based on
                            analogy with Western economies. It is likely that the reasoning in many
                            instances was inapplicable.</item>

                        <item>Yet, we know that trade benefits the bloc probably more than it
                            benefits the West. Thus, we are forced to operate with the theory that
                            outside of goods embodying advanced technology which we believe to be
                            not available to the bloc, the importance of trade to the bloc is more a
                            function of the quantity than the kind of goods exchanged.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>We also agree with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARJ1">Amory</persName>’s
                            statement that “it is hard to see how any control program can seriously
                            impair Soviet might.” We accept this conclusion because of two factors:
                            First, the fact that the Soviet bloc itself, following a policy of
                            self-sufficiency, has severely limited the total volume of East-West
                            trade, thereby reducing the potential scope and impact of any Western

                            their economy so that the slight impact of a Western denial program can
                            be restricted to either the civilian or the military economies or shared

                        <item>We disagree with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARJ1">Amory</persName>’s
                            statement that the differential in control levels between Red China and
                            the European bloc has become less rational because of “Russian
                            intransigence and vociferous support for China on the Formosa issue.”
                            Export controls on trade to China have been rendered partially
                            ineffective on those goods which the European bloc can (and does)
                            transship to Communist China. We are less optimistic than Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ARJ1">Amory</persName> that it would be possible to get
                            a “substantial tightening of <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                            controls” in exchange for “some modification” in <gloss
                                target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls, though this would, we
                            agree, be an excellent bargain. On this subject it is important to note
                            that it is only in the case of Communist China that unilateral U.S.
                            embargo policy can have an important effect. By denying the U.S. market
                            to China, the U.S. by itself has seriously impaired Communist China’s
                            ability to earn foreign exchange and, therefore, to import goods from
                            any country of the world including its Soviet partners.</item>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName></hi>: Your memorandum of February 7, 1955, to the
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Deputy Director of Intelligence, and
                        his reply of February 10, 1955, have been drawn to my attention in the
                        absence of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHS1">Hensel</persName>. I feel
                        compelled to advise you of my reactions to this memorandum because serious
                        consideration of its conclusions, in my opinion, would be prejudicial to the
                        proper solution of the East-West trade policy problem which was assigned to
                        the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>First, however, I would like to comment on the central question raised by
                        your memorandum. The relative ease with which the reallocation of resources
                        may be directed by the monolithic Communist bloc constitutes a major
                        strength of that system. Subject to certain limitations, such as those
                        imposed by transport and technical skill, the Communist rulers can and do
                        shift their available resources to meet the most urgent need of the
                        moment.</p>
                    <p>Since there is a high degree of fungibility in most production resources, a
                        high proportion of the available economic potential can be reallocated from
                        peaceful to military use, especially in view of the probability that
                        production facilities are largely created with the idea that they would be
                        available for war use. It therefore seems clear that the entire Communist
                        bloc economy should logically be considered in any Free World policy aimed
                        at limiting the expansion of military power in the Communist bloc. This
                        principle has been implicit in all actions and recommendations of the
                        Defense Department in this field.</p>
                    <p>As to the memorandum in reply to yours, I doubt the validity of the
                        conclusion in the final paragraph. This conclusion is inconsistent with the
                        substance of the preceding paragraphs and it cannot be supported by
                        intelligence and technical facts as evaluated by Defense Department
                        experts.</p>
                    <p>Any implication that the economic might of the Communist bloc cannot be
                        impaired by any Free World action, merely because the Soviets produced
                        quantitatively more machine tools than the U.S. last year, and that,
                        therefore, all efforts to limit the availability to the Soviet Bloc of Free
                        World economic resources are futile, has no basis in logic.</p>
                    <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0255"/>
                    <p>It seems to me that there are two conflicting views on this whole general
                        subject. One, apparently, is that the prospect of eventual Soviet industrial
                        expansion is such that efforts to delay this expansion are not worthwhile.
                        The other, supported by the Department of Defense, is that any delay in
                        Soviet industrial expansion is important and valuable to U.S. security. In
                        fact, we feel that the situation is such as to justify intensified, rather
                        than relaxed, efforts along these lines.</p>

                        of the Consultative Group plan for shipping controls; failing this, we shall
                        attempt to hold firm the maintenance of the existing controls, with such
                        minor changes as we are able or willing to negotiate; and we shall oppose
                        the change in the existing controls which the British indicated in their

                            >COCOM</gloss>. It was the Secretary’s and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>’s feeling that our following this
                        course of action in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> would exhibit
                        our firmness of purpose in such way as to obviate any erroneous impression
                        on the part of other countries that we had privately agreed with the <gloss

                        the same time opening up other politically sensitive matters in an untimely

                    <p>As I am sure you recognize, the U.S. tactics on East-West trade matters must
                        be considered in conjunction with other foreign policy problems. If it is
                        possible for us to pursue our security trade control concerns either
                        bilaterally or multilaterally in a manner which seems to offer opportunity
                        for constructive progress while yet avoiding undue increase in the political
                        strains upon the governments of our principal allies, it lies in our net
                        interests to follow such tactics.</p>

                    <p>I am concerned over the current copper situation. Some of the disturbing
                        elements in the situation are: the existing shortage in U.S. supply; the
                        continuing unsatisfactory status of the national stockpile; the present
                        strike at the Northern Rhodesian mines; and the increasing shipments to the
                        Soviet Bloc. It is the last element that prompts this memorandum.</p>
                    <p>Copper, in appreciable quantities, is reaching Soviet destinations in both an
                        illegal and a legal manner.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the illegal traffic, it is my understanding that we, in concert
                        with the other governments of the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                        countries, are taking all measures to minimize such shipments, and with some
                        success. I trust that continued pressure will lead to further
                        curtailment.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the legal traffic, the volume exceeds by far the quantities
                        anticipated when certain categories of copper were removed from quantitative
                        control during the revision of the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                        control lists last August. In copper wire alone, 35,000 tons have moved
                        behind the Iron Curtain since August and an additional 24,000 tons are being
                        prepared by the British for shipment during the balance of the calendar
                        year. It is clear that the relaxation of controls in this instance has
                        resulted in a frustration of the agreed <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> policy for effective control of strategic materials to
                        the Bloc. While copper in refined form remains an embargo item, copper in
                        form of wire is reaching the Soviets in sufficient tonnage to largely offset
                        the benefits to be expected from an embargo undertaking. <pb n="227"
                            xml:id="pg_227" facs="0259"/>Thus, on the broad concept of the <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> arrangement, it is manifest that copper
                        wire should be restored to the embargo list.</p>
                    <p>On other grounds there is a U.S. urgency for action to secure a general
                        embargo on copper wire and related copper products. First, there is the
                        action of last Friday by the Department of Commerce to further curtail U.S.
                        exports of copper to friendly nations. Second, also on Friday last, I
                        authorized the sale to industry of copper in the Defense Production Act
                        inventory and material in transit thereto, and I further authorized
                        diversion from <gloss target="#t_DPA1">DPA</gloss> contracts through March
                        31, 1955.<note n="2" xml:id="d53fn2">For text of the Defense Production Act
                            of 1950, see 64 Stat. 798.</note></p>
                    <p>From a public relations point of view and otherwise, the position of the
                        Executive Branch of Government would be untenable in view of these recent
                        actions unless positive and prompt action were taken by the Government to
                        attempt in every way possible to stop the flow of copper to the Soviet Bloc.
                        In meetings on this subject in the Economic Defense Advisory Committee and
                        its subcommittees, the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> has constantly
                        advocated an absolutely firm U.S. position in negotiating for a return to
                        the earlier embargo status for copper wire and related copper products.</p>
                    <p>For the reasons enumerated above and particularly because of the recent
                        release of <gloss target="#t_DPA1">DPA</gloss> copper, I urge you to
                        exercise a maximum negotiating effort to restore the earlier international
                        embargo on copper, whether in negotiations at the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> conference table or in discussions with the British.</p>
                    <p>I enclose a copy of a memorandum for you as Chairman, Operations Coordinating
                        Board, which explains our interest in developing immediate further
                        information on this area of economic warfare which is being practiced on us
                        by the Soviet Bloc.<note n="3" xml:id="d53fn3"><p>Not attached to the source

                                negotiations in the Coordinating Committee the controls over copper
                                wire will be substantially tightened in the near future.”

                    <p>The Steering Committee has made a preliminary examination, from both the
                        short and long-range points of view, of the existing economic defense policy
                        and program and of certain recommendations for change submitted separately
                        by several agencies. The Steering Committee finds that the various agency
                        papers merit further study and consideration in the framework of a broader
                        and more meticulous review. Such review will permit a more detailed
                        development of the concepts involved, as well as a careful exploration of
                        the circumstances and time factors suited to particular changes in current
                        economic defense policies.</p>

                                            fundamental importance dictate that under present
                                            circumstances we should maintain free world controls on
                                            economic relations with Communist China at current
                                            levels (a summary of the reasons underlying this basic
                                            conclusion is appended hereto as Tab A). At the same
                                            time, unless there were a material worsening of present
                                            tensions, it would be unrealistic to contemplate that we
                                            could persuade our allies to expand or heighten the
                                            level of multilateral controls toward Communist China,
                                            since these countries have been chafing already over the
                                            extent to which these controls now exceed those applied
                                            to the European Soviet bloc. Accordingly, although from
                                            time to time the greatest sense of urgency has seemed to
                                            pertain to the area of the Communist China controls, and
                                            in fact this problem was the one which largely
                                            occasioned the present policy review, it appears that
                                            the United States should take no overt action at this
                                            time toward material change in these controls.</item>

                                        <item>Concerning Eastern Europe: The multilateral controls
                                            applicable to the European Soviet bloc have only
                                            recently been substantially revised. The general
                                            revision of the lists became effective as of mid-August,
                                            but a few difficult items still remain unresolved. In
                                                <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0262"/>addition,
                                            new enforcement measures have been established,
                                            effective a little over a month ago. Whereas these
                                            revised controls apparently now satisfy fairly well the
                                            basic objectives of our Western European allies, they do
                                            present many serious deficiencies and are, in any case,
                                            short of being what, in the U.S. mind, they could and
                                            should be. These defects in the controls structure are
                                            emphasized when an attempt is made to look at the
                                            Communist bloc as a whole. A number of factors, however,
                                            make it plain that the deficiencies in the control
                                            structure will take a substantial period of time to
                                            remedy, even in part.</item>
                                    </list></p>
                                <p>In the first place, as already noted, our flexibility to adjust
                                    the control structure to a “bloc-as-a-whole” approach is limited
                                    at the present by the requirements of our general position to
                                    maintain the controls toward Communist China. This sort of
                                    adjustment must therefore await either an appropriate time for
                                    revision in the Communist China controls or the development of
                                    new concepts and a fundamentally new approach to controls toward
                                    the entire Communist bloc, on the basis of which the U.S. could
                                    reasonably expect to negotiate agreement to move toward
                                    uniformity by substantial strengthening of controls applied to
                                    Eastern Europe.</p>
                                <p>Secondly, at this stage of their preliminary analysis, the
                                    agencies within the U.S. Government harbor many and diverse
                                    views as to what is wrong with the security trade controls and
                                    how these faults should be corrected. It will take no small
                                    effort, individually and collectively, to define these views in
                                    specific detail, to compare and evaluate them, and to develop
                                    them into a homogeneous program commanding government-wide
                                    adherence.</p>
                                <p>In the third place, the need is recognized for meshing the
                                    economic defense program more intimately with other broad
                                    programs in which the United States is engaged. More time and
                                    thought should be devoted to how other efforts and actions of
                                    the United States can assist in achieving our economic defense
                                    goals, and vice versa.</p>
                                <p>Finally, and most important of all, this review must
                                    accomplish—or abandon as unattainable—a ground-up development of
                                    a new approach to, or rationale for, security trade control
                                    restrictions to the Communist bloc as a whole. While the
                                    criteria for selection of “strategic” items have been useful in
                                    the past, particularly for negotiating multilateral agreements,
                                    at this time, in the face of divergent interpretations and a
                                    growing body of precedents grounded in political compromise, the
                                    criteria have become at once confusing and less useful. We need
                                    new concepts as a guide for our own determinations. Even more,
                                    as a means to revitalize the Consultative Group and the
                                    Coordinating Committee we need a new approach toward security
                                    trade controls and a larger measure of fundamental agreement
                                    between cooperating countries as to the objectives of the
                                    program. The old criteria obviously cannot be expected to carry
                                    a major effort to modify the structure just enacted upon them.
                                    And the current divergencies in attitude and basic concepts on
                                    the part of the various Participating Countries would inevitably
                                    frustrate endeavors to achieve agreement on any substantial
                                    changes in the control program.</p></item>

                                            already noted, the revisions just accomplished have
                                            relieved most of the international frictions that had
                                            been developing over control policy, and the Paris
                                            committees will be preoccupied for several months more

                                            list review. The new enforcement measures are just
                                            taking hold, and are still being developed, and a period
                                            of experience will be needed before stock can be taken

                                        <item>Concerning Communist China, the pressure for change on
                                            the part of our allies likewise has lessened, though
                                            presumably this respite is more temporary. Whatever
                                            their present preference or ultimate choice, our China
                                            Committee partners seem not disposed to contend with the
                                            known strong U.S. views on maintenance of China controls
                                            so long as the current circumstances of tension endure.
                                            This appears to be true even of Japan, which, for both
                                            economic and political reasons, has been recently the

                                <p>While we may not be able much longer to forestall discussion of
                                    the general question, we should probably be able, with
                                    appropriate bilateral preparations, to obtain agreement for
                                    temporary, but indefinite, continuance of the present level of
                                    controls. Even if we should feel it necessary to agree to some
                                    action other than mere extension of current controls, we still
                                    would have some months of time for review and decision, since at
                                    the most we should have only to agree to multilateral study
                                    toward subsequent revision of the controls. Thus, on even the
                                    most pessimistic of estimates, we should have at least until the
                                    coming summer before we should have to apply the results of our

                                        should clearly emphasize at this time that the existing

                                        government. During the present session of the Congress, it
                                        will often be necessary for the executive agencies to appear
                                        before the legislative branch and speak upon one aspect or

                                        responding to an unintended but implicit invitation to
                                        pronounce policy for the executive in the very field of

                            CHINA</p>
                        <p>It is important to keep the Chinese Communist regime under economic (and
                            other) pressures. Such pressures add to the strains which can ultimately
                            lead to disintegration; the Communist regime has undertaken heavy
                            commitments, and it appears probable that it can not under present
                            circumstances increase its resources fast enough to cover all
                            commitments. This kind of dilemma tends to lead to a breakdown.</p>
                        <p>In a situation like the present one, where Chinese Communist intentions
                            with regard to Formosa are clearly hostile, and their future course
                            seriously threatens world peace, it would be highly impolitic to release
                            the Chinese Communists from whatever harrassment and limitation the free
                            world controls are causing. The reduction of controls would be taken by
                            countries in Asia, in Europe, and by the American people to mean a
                            change in policy towards Communist <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233"
                                facs="0265"/>China which is not justified by the circumstances or by
                            the behavior of the regime.</p>
                        <p>As long as the United States continues to maintain pressures against the
                            Chinese Communists, the Communists are on notice that a strong and
                            active opponent stands in the path of aggression which they would like
                            to pursue. Continued actions in this field are more persuasive evidence
                            of intentions than are mere statements.</p>

                        <item><p>We believe that the Russians would be unwilling to make any but the
                                most minor concessions to obtain either a relaxation of Western
                                trade controls or US surplus agricultural commodities. While it is
                                extremely difficult to evaluate the impact of Western controls on
                                the Bloc economy it is certainly not of great significance. It is
                                much less today than it was in 1949–50 when controls were first
                                imposed, partly because the Bloc has had time to adjust to the
                                controls and partly because there was a major relaxation in the
                                control system in 1954. There is evidence to suggest that lack of
                                foreign exchange may have inhibited USSR trade with the West as much
                                as our export controls.</p>
                            <p>While the problem of Soviet agriculture is a serious one it is by no
                                means critical nor is it of recent origin. If food shortages, as a
                                result of inadequate agricultural production, were causing serious
                                internal political difficulties the USSR was always free to import
                                food supplies from the West. The export of agricultural commodities
                                from the West is not legally controlled. The Soviet Union might very
                                well like to obtain US agricultural surpluses for local currency and
                                this would help with their program of collectivization in Eastern
                                Europe. It is our view, however, that this and any other benefits
                                that the USSR would derive from such surpluses would not be
                                considered of sufficient importance as to warrant the making of any
                                real political concessions.</p></item>

                            <p>The purpose of these statements is largely propaganda to divide the
                                US from its allies and to put the onus for the breakdown of the
                                world into two rival camps on the US. The point has been made with
                                some truth that USSR would not like to see the complete elimination
                                of trade controls because this would deprive them of an important
                                propaganda weapon.</p></item>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> then went on to brief the
                        Council on the paragraphs dealing with the U.S. position on East-West trade
                        at the conference, noting the split of views in paragraph 27–a, where the
                        majority proposal indicated that if the United States considered that its
                        interests would be advanced thereby, the United States might agree to adopt
                        a more liberal policy with respect to the export of non-strategic goods in
                        conjunction with a demonstrated Soviet willingness “to expand East-West
                        trade in non-strategic goods”. The Defense proposal, as opposed to the
                        majority proposal, stated that the United States should not agree to such a
                        ore liberal policy in <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0272"/>the export of
                        non-strategic items except in conjunction with Soviet willingness “to
                        ameliorate the fundamental sources of tension between East and West”.</p>
                    <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> had explained the
                        difference in these two viewpoints, the President expressed the opinion that
                        this was one which must be played by ear. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added that there was certainly a
                        considerable difference of opinion as to the importance the Soviets attached
                        to the relaxation of East-West trade restrictions. He said that it was his
                        own feeling that our willingness to relax our trade controls was a strong
                        negotiating card for us vis-à-vis the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said that in place
                        of either of the proposed versions, he would substitute the phrase that we
                        would adopt a more liberal trade policy in non-strategic goods “whenever the
                        United States believed that its interests would be advanced thereby.” The
                        President added that that was precisely his view, of course, though he was
                        willing to accept the version proposed by the majority.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that wasn’t it a
                        matter of what was strategic and what wasn’t? All that the Soviets really
                        wanted out of East-West trade were strategic items and stuff that
                        contributed to their war potential. In reply, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1"
                            >Anderson</persName> read sub-paragraph d, which pointed out that in no
                        event should the United States reduce or eliminate its embargo on arms,
                        ammunition, implements of war, atomic energy materials, or advance
                        prototypes of strategic items.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that the topic of East-West trade seemed to him to
                        arise at nearly every meeting of the National Security Council; hence the
                        U.S. delegation to Geneva would be very familiar indeed with the views of
                        the Council and there was not the slightest danger of making a mistake in
                        this area, although in the area of East-West trade we might find ourselves
                        on one side of the argument while our allies and the Soviets were on the
                        other.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> then turned to
                        sub-paragraph e, dealing with the problem of being prepared to discuss trade
                        with Communist China and pointing out that we should not at the Geneva
                        Conference undertake to discuss this matter, for reasons set forth in the
                        subparagraph. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> indicated
                        that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Joseph M. Dodge</persName>, Chairman of
                        the Council on Foreign Economic Policy, had expressed his agreement with the
                        views set forth in this sub-paragraph.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said he believed that
                        the allied attitude toward trade controls vis-à-vis Communist China was more
                        favorable to the U.S. view than it had been two years ago. The President
                        said that the fact of the matter was that we were not going to talk about
                        these issues at Geneva.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he had that
                        very morning suggested to Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName> that he take up with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName>’s Council those questions of economic policy and
                        East-West trade that might come up for negotiation after the conclusion of
                        the Summit Conference. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName> pointed out that unfortunately the Council on
                        Foreign Economic Policy did not have any representation from the Central
                        Intelligence Agency or from the Department of Defense, both of which had a
                        legitimate interest and responsibility on the subject of East-West trade. He
                        therefore suggested that instead of the <persName corresp="#p_DJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName> Council, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"
                            >Hollister</persName>’s people in the State Department provided the best
                        forum for discussions on the U.S. position with respect to East-West trade
                        and similar economic problems. The <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"
                            >Hollister</persName> people could work out the U.S. position, in which
                        process they would have representation from all the interested agencies.
                        After the position was formulated, Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName> thought that some kind of subcommittee of the Big
                        Four powers would provide the best vehicle for the subsequent international
                        negotiations. The important thing, in any event, said Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>, is that no single department of
                        the Government can really advise the President on these matters.</p>
                    <p>The President took issue with Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName>’s argument, and said he believed that Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName>’s Council, with the additional
                        elements of representation from Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                            >CIA</gloss>, was the best instrumentality for formulating U.S. policy
                        in this field. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> and his
                        people had too many heavy operating responsibilities. In fact, said the
                        President, it was for precisely such matters that we had set up the
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> Council.<note n="3"

                            <item>Beyond the range of munitions, atomic energy items and prototypes
                                of advanced technology, security trade controls against the
                                Communist bloc, whatever the Free World’s intent in withholding an
                                export, will not necessarily assure that the Soviets will lack an
                                item of the type embargoed, but will impose a cost upon the Soviet
                                economy.</item>

                            <item>The relative economic advantage of any East-West trade is greater
                                for the Soviet bloc than for the Free World. Thus, leaving aside all
                                considerations other than the economic, the cost of trade controls
                                upon the Soviet bloc could be maximized by maximizing the
                                curtailment of East-West trade.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>For purposes of an economic defense program, this finding must be
                                modified by a realistic appraisal of the impact of whatever trade
                                controls are under consideration, weighed in terms of U.S. political
                                objectives, both with respect to the Communist bloc and with respect
                                to our relationships with our allies.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Even if maximized, the potential impact of trade controls on
                                Sino-Soviet economic capabilities for war would be small;
                                nonetheless, this impact is of value to the security interests of
                                the Free World. The special higher level of controls now maintained
                                against Communist China impose on that regime an aggregate
                                additional cost estimated from 155 to 245 million dollars annually,
                                the largest portion of which results from U.S. import and financial
                                blocking controls.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>In general, the effectiveness of the economic defense systems
                                depends upon multilateral cooperation. Unilateral U.S. measures can
                                be effective only under special circumstances.</item>

                            <item>Our major partners in East-West trade controls have always been
                                most reluctant to adopt measures which they would regard as being in
                                the nature of economic warfare against the peoples of the Communist
                                bloc. Under present conditions, these other governments are
                                unwilling to extend the scope and severity of multilateral trade
                                controls. They are eager to reduce the levels of controls now
                                applied against Communist China, and although they agreed last
                                summer that the present narrowed scope of the control lists for
                                Eastern Europe would be required for the “long haul”, they would
                                welcome some further relaxation in these controls also.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>Except in the case of Japan, the objections of other friendly
                                governments to the trade controls now are based primarily on
                                political, rather than economic, reasons. Should world tensions
                                increase, a stiffening of multilateral East-West trade controls
                                might become negotiable. Should such tensions decrease, the
                                pressures for relaxation of the multilateral China controls would
                                become, as a practical matter, irresistible, and pressures would
                                increase for further relaxation toward the European Soviet bloc as
                                well.</item>

                            <item>Should downward adjustment in the multilateral China controls
                                become necessary or desirable in the near future, the U.S. is not
                                well prepared, in terms of criteria and listing techniques, to
                                retain a level of export controls for Communist China, or for the
                                whole Communist bloc, which would be higher than the present level
                                for Eastern Europe.</item>

                    <p>During the Heads of Government Meeting at Geneva, July 18–23, the specific
                        subject of East-West trade was not discussed. The Department informed all
                        diplomatic missions in Europe, as well as Tokyo, of this fact in circular
                        airgram 1163, August 9: “While the specific subject of ‘East-West Trade’ was
                        not discussed during the Conference of Heads of Government in Geneva, it was
                        an integral part of the statements on ‘The Development of Economic and
                        Cultural Contacts Between East and West’ by President <persName

                        included texts of each of those statements and the final directive of the
                        Heads of Government to the Foreign Ministers. (Department of State, Central
                        Files, 460.509/8–955)</p>
                    <p>In circular airgram 1267 to Paris and London, August 12, the Department
                        explained that it desired to inform the other Participating Countries in the
                        Consultative Group of the agreed United States-British-French position paper
                        on East-West trade. This tripartite position paper was drafted just prior to
                        the Geneva Conference, and the Department believed that the other
                        Participating Countries might find it useful. Accordingly, the Department
                        instructed the Embassies in Paris and London to deliver to the appropriate
                        Foreign Office official a draft statement regarding the agreed tripartite
                        position paper along with an “urgent request” that the United Kingdom and
                        France cosponsor such a notification in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"

                    <p>The fact that Communist China and the U.S. are meeting in Geneva now<note

                        not by itself create a situation that warrants any relaxation of controls

                    <p>If it is the intent of the U.S. that trade controls towards both the Eastern
                        European Bloc and Communist China are to be held in a status quo, then the
                        U.S. will have to make a special effort to align other countries to support
                        that intent. Without that it will be almost impossible for the U.S.
                        unilaterally to avoid relaxation.</p>
                    <p>It is recommended, therefore, that the U.S. should approach the <gloss

                    <p>This is a matter of urgency. Any member country can ask for a <gloss

                        significance because of the expressed intent of India to raise the question

                        September 27. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said this
                        action seemed to show disregard for fact that success and effectiveness
                            <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> operation in past had been based
                        largely upon close prior collaboration and consultation among France–<gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>–US. It also disregarded substance and spirit
                        of Tripartite agreement on <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss>–W trade matters
                        prior Summit Meeting. This position was that concessions on West’s security
                        trade control system should not be for commercial advantage alone, but
                        should be related to disarmament and security. Progress toward such
                        settlement could not possibly be judged until after October Foreign
                        Ministers Meeting in Geneva. As to <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>
                        discussion of China controls, the US would regard as unthinkable a review of
                        present system at a time when US-Communist China negotiations currently
                        under way in Geneva at Ambassadorial level. These are delicate talks and
                        only as they advance can it be possible to determine Communist China’s
                        future intentions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said
                        that we did not oppose calling of <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>, but
                        timing could hardly be worse. Hence, we hoped that French could arrange for
                        postponement of date for meeting.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said, in conclusion, that

                        to the European Soviet bloc; and (D) China trade controls.</p>
                    <p>Certain preliminary questions were asked. The Secretary inquired why it was
                        felt that the U.S. controls put more pressure on Communist China than did
                        the multilateral controls. It was explained that the higher level of
                        multilateral export controls applied against Communist China than against
                        Eastern Europe increased the cost to the Chinese Communists of procurement
                        of these differential items through Eastern Europe, but an even greater cost
                        in loss of foreign exchange was imposed, not by the still higher level of
                        U.S. export controls, but rather by the U.S. import and blocking controls,
                        which cut off dollar remittances and denied the U.S. market to Chinese
                        Communist goods. The Secretary inquired whether the Chinese did not sell
                        their products elsewhere and whether these products, such as bristles, did
                        not come indirectly into the U.S. market. It was explained that the U.S.
                        market was largely unique and irreplaceable for certain important Chinese
                        products and that there was relatively small leakage of these goods into the
                        U.S. via friendly countries. The import from friendly countries of paint
                        brushes with Chinese bristles had been restricted; cashmere wool had
                        presented some problems.</p>
                    <p>As background to the automobile topic it was explained that Ford was
                        interested in the sale of 700 passenger cars to the USSR, but didn’t want
                        even to approach the Commerce Department for a license if the State
                        Department were disposed to object to the transaction. It was assumed that
                        the sale would be for cash, and in answer to a question from Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, it was explained that the earlier
                        Chevrolet sale to Bulgaria had represented a cash transaction for which the
                        license had been sought by an exporter of automobiles.</p>
                    <p>Discussion was then had upon the four topics dealt with in the
                        memorandum.</p>
                    <p>Concerning the French call for a <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> meeting,
                        it was agreed that the date proposed was most untimely, and that as we had
                        now asked the French to alter the date to November or December, we should
                        simply await developments.</p>
                    <p>Concerning the related topic of the China controls, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RRB1">Robertson</persName> remarked that we should do
                        everything possible to prevent any curtailment of the controls. However, it
                        was felt here too that no detailed discussion was necessary now, since we
                        hoped the meeting would be deferred. If we later had to face a meeting, a
                        position paper would be drafted and discussed at that time.</p>
                    <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0284"/>
                    <p>Concerning the question of the export of Ford automobiles to Russia, the
                        Secretary said he was inclined to let Ford make the sale. He then went on to
                        develop some of his philosophy toward East-West relations in this
                        “post-Geneva” period.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said one should not expect the spirit of Geneva to operate to
                        maintain the status quo in the world. Rather, the spirit of Geneva should
                        accelerate the evolutionary processes toward German reunification and other
                        Free World goals related to peace. Geneva, he said, had downgraded the
                        attitude that certain positions in the way of the attainment of these goals
                        were necessary for defense.</p>
                    <p>The present period, he said, is a sort of probationary period. If after some
                        six months we can discern no progress toward our objectives, we may then
                        have to go back to our old posture. This is a line of thought, he said,
                        which he was presently engaged in hammering out with the President.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we should do all we can now to create conditions that
                        will encourage Russian willingness to pay the price for the new posture. In
                        this respect he felt that we could create more pressure on the Russians if
                        we start now to let some things move which are under our own control, with
                        the threat of cutting them off again if the Soviets did not come through. If
                        we hold back completely, the Russians may wonder whether they would really
                        get anything once they had made concessions. Let some things go now, he
                        said; let the Soviets taste how good this is and whet their appetites for
                        more.</p>
                    <p>The discussion was then broadened to other non-strategic items. The pending
                        case of rolled steel sheets was cited, it being pointed out that we had not
                        licensed an item like that to the bloc for years, that such an item carried
                        a greater connotation of relationship to military production and that the
                        export would be more likely to imply a change of policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> said the export of
                        automobiles would release steel sheets for other purposes. The point also
                        was made that steel sheets could be exported to the bloc by other
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we should let the steel sheets be exported (he pointed
                        out, however, that if the steel sheets, or any other item, were sought to be
                        exported to East Germany, we should check to make sure we did not frustrate
                        any effort that the Federal Republic was making to use the pressure of
                        curtailed trade to resolve the problem of the highway tolls).</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> inquired about heavy
                        machinery or items of electrical equipment. The Secretary said we need not
                        try to determine such cases hypothetically; the problem should be brought up
                        again when and if such cases arose.</p>
                    <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0285"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> then pressed the question of
                        agricultural exports. He pointed to the magnitude of our disposal problem
                        and suggested that the Soviet bloc was one place where we might be able to
                        dispose of substantial quantities of our surpluses. In reply to a question
                        from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> said he thought we could get gold
                        from the Soviets if we offered our agricultural products at world prices.
                        Allusion was made to the earlier plan to barter perishable agricultural
                        products for non-perishable strategic materials, and to the
                        Attorney-General’s ruling barring certain actions under <gloss

                        suggested that the legal status be reviewed and the policy questions be

                            >Benson</persName> departed on his European trip.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d66fn4">Secretary of Agriculture <persName corresp="#p_BET1"
                                >Benson</persName> was scheduled to visit several European nations
                            between August 27 and September 9 in order to initiate negotiations for
                            the marketing of U.S. surplus agricultural commodities. Documentation on
                            his trip is in Department of State, Central File 033.1100–BE.</note></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRB1">Robertson</persName> commented that
                        agricultural products were high cost items in the Communist economy and that
                        food had been highly strategic for the Chinese Communists. However, it was
                        emphasized that the present discussion dealt only with possible exports to
                        the European Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said he believed that the
                        USSR does not face any immediate food crisis. Therefore, and in line with
                        what the Secretary had said regarding gaining leverage on the Russians by
                        beginning to ease trade restrictions, perhaps as a sort of one-shot
                        operation we should explore letting go a trickle that could be turned
                        off.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the question that concerned him was, could we turn
                        this off? He was clear that we could cut off automobiles or machinery
                        whenever we chose, but with agricultural surpluses, would we not be whetting
                        our own appetites as well as the Russians’? Might we not be building up
                        political pressures that we could not control? He would not want to start
                        something we couldn’t stop.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> said he thought we could
                        control public opinion and pressures through the farm organizations. The
                        leaders of these groups are good men with whom we can work closely and who
                        have a pretty good control over their members.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he was satisfied that the Russian leaders’ change of
                        tactics stemmed from two causes: one, that their old tactics had failed
                        them; and two, that they are under great pressures from within to give their
                        people more, particularly consumer goods. He said he believes the Russians
                        will pay a real political price in Europe to be able to carry on with their
                        new policies and not have <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0286"/>to revert
                        to their old policies. How big a price they will pay, he didn’t know; this
                        is what we shall find out in Geneva in October.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary concluded that we should go ahead and feel out the situation
                        concerning possible sale of agricultural products. He agreed that the legal
                        question should be reviewed and explored. He agreed that he should talk with
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> about this before the
                        latter leaves for Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName>
                        then suggested that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> be
                        invited to come with Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Garnett</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_BEL1">Butz</persName> to have lunch with the

                    <p>On August 29, Japanese Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                            >Shigemitsu</persName> arrived in the United States for discussions with
                        United States officials. During the course of a discussion on August 31
                        between United States and Japanese officials, including <persName
                            corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> made the following remarks regarding
                        economic defense policy: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“With respect to trade with Communist China the Secretary said he had
                                the feeling that this was more of a psychological than an economic
                                factor. Japan never had a big trade with China proper, independent
                                of its domination there. Korea and Manchuria were big markets after
                                Japan’s political influence was established there, but in the main
                                China is a poor area and does not have much to export. The general
                                experience of countries that have tried to trade with China is that
                                they get nothing worthwhile except in return for highly strategic
                                goods for which the Communists are willing to make a sacrifice in
                                exchange. The Secretary doubted that a change in the control list
                                would have great economic results. You may say, he added, that if
                                that is so, shouldn’t we modify the list to conform to the European
                                list. The other side of the picture is that it is not easy to make a
                                change unless it is occasioned by some act on the part of the
                                Chinese which seems to call for some recognition on the part of the
                                free nations. The Ambassadorial talks going on in Geneva have so far
                                been unproductive. And at present the United States considers that
                                there should be no relaxation of trade controls. He appreciated that
                                the problem in Japan is partly political rather than economic but
                                believed that Japan should cooperate with the United States because
                                Japan also has a stake. Sooner or later some revision of the export
                                list is inevitable but the time has not yet come.” (Memorandum of

                                        views as to security requirements of area should be accorded
                                        special respect by countries bearing less responsibilities.
                                        We regard perpetuation of differential as essential for
                                        security reasons. Most promising means of relaxing tensions
                                        between US and China lie in current bilateral US-Communist
                                        China talks at Geneva. We believe minor concessions being
                                        made there by Communist Chinese are result of Free World
                                        firmness and pressure. To lessen firmness and relax pressure
                                        prematurely might well frustrate the prolonged and
                                        painstaking attempt now being made to move toward

                                        result from Chinese belief that it can divide West without

                        and trade embargo. Some hopeful progress being made re renunciation force
                        and we are therefore most anxious maintain trade controls as point of
                        pressure to get really effective declaration on renunciation of use of force
                        which would serve all our interests in Far East.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the Secretary
                        had personally talked with the French and the British about the problem of

                        controls until the outcome of the Johnson–Wang talks becomes clear. We
                        therefore do not want to bring this subject up at the meeting of the <gloss
                            target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> in December. We think that the British and
                        the French are going to be willing to cooperate with us on this question and
                        we would very much appreciate having the same kind of cooperation from the
                        Japanese Government.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> referred to the list
                        of items which the Japanese Government had submitted<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d76fn2">Reference is to a 27-page note handed to U.S. officials
                            by the Japanese Embassy on October 5, which included a list of items
                            that the Japanese desired to delete from the International China Embargo
                            Lists. The Japanese explained that they were submitting the list “in
                            response to the suggestions made by the Secretary of State of the United
                            States of America in the course of recent discussions in Washington,
                            D.C.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note> and said that he understood
                        that this list was much longer than anything we had expected but he wondered
                        whether perhaps three or four items of special interest to Japan could not
                        be handled in some way. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                        answered that from our point of view the timing would be very bad, since it
                        would be likely to upset the whole structure of controls at this critical
                        time, and he would appreciate it if the Japanese Government could defer any
                        effort to secure action even on such items.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Herb</hi>: As suggested in our phone conversation
                        last Friday I am writing to indicate those aspects of East-West trade which
                        are bothering us at this time. You will recall, perhaps, the difficulties we
                        have had in respect to copper shortages during this current year, which
                        resulted in establishing a quota on scrap exports substantially below the
                        rate at which this material was exported during the past year. While our
                        economy has been suffering from an inadequate supply of copper and a rise in
                        price from 30¢ to 45¢ a pound, Britain primarily, along with a few other
                        European countries, has licensed exports to the Soviets of copper in the
                        form of wire to the extent of 111,000 metric tons during the past 12½
                        months. We feel, and we have some German support for this position, that
                        immediate and strong efforts should be made in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> to put an embargo on the export of copper of all forms by
                        all <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> participants to communist
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>We have just learned also that the United Kingdom has recently obtained
                            <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> permission to use the quotas of
                        other <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> countries to ship
                        British-built jeeps to the Soviet bloc, and that <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> has agreed to the transfer of 38 four-wheel drive
                        automotive vehicles from the unallocated reserve quota in addition to 85
                        units from other country quotas. Furthermore, we have a report to the effect
                        that a shipment of 100 tons of British jeeps has just transitted the
                        Bosphorous for the destination of Constanza, Romania. Our acquiescence to
                        these shipments by the United Kingdom is highly inconsistent with our recent
                        action of suspending from export privileges two officials of the
                        Willys–Overland Corporation because of their acceptance of an order for 100
                        jeeps shipped to Syria but ultimately transshipped to Romania.</p>
                    <p>Even more disconcerting is the continuation of unlimited quotas of many
                        strategic items on International List II simply because none of the member
                        countries would agree to reasonable quotas on such items as large horizontal
                        boring mills of the elephant variety and many other machine tools considered
                        as highly strategic and under embargo for shipment from the United States,
                        as well as unlimited shipments of merchant vessels by European members of
                            <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>. This has rendered international
                        control more of a myth than a reality.</p>
                    <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0302"/>
                    <p>Our problem is, should we now, in the light of the unproductive outcome of
                        the recent Geneva Conference, support the consideration of a realistic
                        control program in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> for early
                        deliberation or, alternatively, should we support or ask for an early <gloss
                            target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> meeting to consider the whole East-West trade
                        program in its broadest aspects? Consideration of these unsatisfactory
                        situations either in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> or <gloss
                            target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> would have our support. A recent statement to
                        the Herald Tribune Washington Bureau by Senator Carl Curtis<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d77fn2">Carl T. Curtis (D.–Nebraska).</note> underlines the
                        possibility of increasing the difficulties for the Administration if we are
                        unsuccessful in obtaining international support for our East-West trade
                        control objectives.</p>
                    <p>I assume that the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> will shortly receive
                        a report from the Secretary of State in order to complete its consideration
                        of the East-West trade problem on which <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss> withheld judgment until after the Geneva Conference. I
                        look forward to having the benefit of your views on these matters.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have read with considerable
                        interest your letter of November 23, 1955,<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2"><ref
                                target="#d77"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi></ref>.</note> in regard
                        to certain East-West trade problems. As you are aware, problems of this
                        nature became particularly difficult to handle in the pre-Geneva atmosphere.
                        I am hopeful now that the Geneva discussions are behind us that the Paris
                        Committees will be able to proceed with their business on an orderly basis.
                        We hope in this connection that the Secretary’s representations to the
                        United Kingdom and France will soon have placed us in a position where we
                        could more accurately judge the <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0303"
                        />extent to which the United States could now usefully press for improvement
                        in the current multilateral control operations and where it would be in our
                        interest to suggest an early meeting of the <gloss target="#t_CG1"
                            >CG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>As to your particular concern, we share your feelings about the copper wire
                        situation which has been a source of concern to us for a considerable period
                        of time. The large amounts of copper wire licensed by the <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> countries in the last fifteen months
                        are very disconcerting since such exports obviously result in a substantial
                        frustration of the embargo control over copper itself. As you doubtless
                        know, we are faced with the fact that some months ago the British Cabinet
                        took a firm position that this item should not be restored to the embargo
                        list. Notwithstanding this decision, we are inclined to agree that a new
                        effort should be made to plug this loophole in the embargo. Owing to the
                        level at which the last decision on this question was taken in the British
                        Government and on account also of other strategic control questions we now
                        have pending with the United Kingdom and in the Paris Committees, careful
                        consideration clearly has to be given to questions of the timing and the
                        nature of any renewed negotiations for raising the level of controls over
                        copper wire. These questions, however, are operating details on which our
                        representatives in the Economic Defense Advisory Committee structure will be
                        consulting with your representatives and those of the other interested
                        agencies.</p>
                    <p>The matter cited in your letter concerning the exports of four-wheel drive
                        vehicles by the British is quite a different sort of question. We have
                        generally felt that it is permissible for a <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> country to draw upon the reserve quota in accordance with
                            <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> procedures or to borrow from
                        other countries’ quotas as long as there is no effect upon the agreed global
                        quota. As a matter of fact, we have at times suggested the use of the
                        “borrowing” technique so that an individual country would not have to
                        request an exception for a shipment in excess of the quota and so that the
                        total level of shipments would be kept within the agreed global quota.</p>
                    <p>We do not feel that our acquiescence to the recent British shipments is
                        inconsistent with the suspension action taken in regard to two officials of
                        the Willys-Overland Corporation. In the first place, the type of vehicle
                        involved is no longer under multilateral embargo as it was when the
                        transaction in the Willys-Overland case was executed. Secondly, and more
                        importantly, the reason for suspension of export privileges in the
                        Willys-Overland case rested on the fact that the firm in effect knew that
                        the purported destination of the shipment given to the United States
                        licensing authorities was incorrect. The infraction of United States
                        regulations represented by <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0304"/>this
                        deception would be grounds for punitive action whatever the level of control
                        over the item might be at the time. Such a consideration is not present in
                        the case of the United Kingdom exports of Landrovers; on the contrary, these
                        exports appear to have been made in conformity with the applicable
                        regulations.</p>
                    <p>Although we too would like to see the “3(d)” quotas eliminated, we have not
                        felt that they permit “unlimited” shipments of items so controlled. It is
                        our hope that both the other countries and ourselves will show greater
                        flexibility in dealing with these items in the future and that <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> will thus be able to agree upon
                        specific quotas rather than 3(d) control. In this connection, it may be
                        noted that <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> will shortly undertake
                        the usual periodic review of the List II quotas.</p>
                    <p>We are giving consideration, of course, to the relevance of the recent Geneva
                        discussions to the possible policy implications of the review of economic
                        defense policy which has been held in suspense by the Council on Foreign
                        Economic Policy since last summer. Speaking generally, the discussions on
                        the trade questions at Geneva developed substantially in accord with the
                        predictions previously made by the United States. They provided us an
                        occasion for demonstrating sincerity and constructiveness in our approach to
                        the development of East-West contacts. On the other hand, they demonstrated
                        the fact that the blame should be accorded to the Soviets for preventing
                        progress toward this objective. It appears important to us that in the
                        months to come we continue our flexible and reasonable treatment of trade
                        control questions in order to emphasize and not to impair the record of good
                        faith which we established at Geneva and in order to allow the attitude and
                        actions adopted in furtherance of the President’s policies to have the
                        fullest opportunity for gradual and cumulative effect. We hope to prepare
                        for <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> consideration specific proposals
                        based on the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> review and on our recent
                        negotiations with the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union. These
                        will have as their purpose the maintenance of a multilateral trade control
                        system effectively contributing to free world security and unity.<note n="3"

                        from British commercial interests to reduce constraints on trade with China.
                        He added that he did not see how his government could resist this pressure
                        much beyond the end of the year. <persName corresp="#p_MH1"

                    <p>Dear Livie:</p>
                    <p>I am sorry not to have been able to reply sooner to your letter of November
                        16 about the future treatment of the China trade controls.<note n="2"

                        the issues involved and my Secretary of State has now replied to the letter
                        he received from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d80fn3">See the editorial note, <ref target="#d79"><hi
                                    rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note> I attach a copy of this
                        reply.</p>
                    <p>It is naturally our hope that the United States government may yet be able to
                        agree to an alignment of the China list with that in force for the Soviet
                        bloc. If we can march in step this would clearly be the best solution and
                        would, I believe, given the strength of feeling here, be a real contribution
                        to Anglo-American relations.</p>
                    <p>As things are, however, the government’s position in defending the present
                        scope of the China embargo has become untenable. Indeed the whole system of
                        security controls on East/West trade is <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274"
                            facs="0306"/>being undermined by the maintenance of controls which can
                        no longer be logically defended on strategic grounds.</p>
                    <p>Consequently if by the early days of the new year when Parliament reassembles
                        an agreed alignment of the two lists is still ruled out, we shall inform the
                        China Committee of the Consultative Group that H.M. Government can no longer
                        see any strategic justification for banning the additional commodities for
                        China, and that from January 15 we propose, by a gradual unobtrusive
                        process, and over a period, to bring the United Kingdom list for China into
                        conformity with the agreed list for the Soviet bloc. We should tell them
                        that we intended to remove items in groups of two or three at a time giving
                        the committee in each case advance notice of the item or group of items to
                        be removed from the United Kingdom list and the date when removal would be
                        operative.</p>
                    <p>While keeping our partners in the Consultative Group fully informed in this
                        way we should not expect to make any general statement in Parliament. The
                        gradual whittling down of our list, as opposed to a wholesale reduction,
                        would be a further discouragement to publicity.</p>
                    <p>In concluding I should like to emphasise once more that our decision to
                        proceed in this way has been taken only after earnest consideration and
                        after my Secretary of State had successfully resisted strong pressure for an
                        immediate change of policy so as to give your negotiators leisure to play
                        the trade card in their discussions with the Chinese.<note n="4"

                            >NSC</gloss> 5429/5 of December 22, 1954, provides in paragraph 7c(2)
                        that the United States should “urge other Free World countries to maintain
                        the current level of export controls on trade with Communist China”. It
                        provides further in paragraph 7c(3) that, “Whenever it may be determined by
                        the Secretary of State that further effort to maintain the current
                        multilaterally agreed level of export controls would be seriously divisive

                        an accommodation with the Soviet Bloc, the Secretary should report such
                        determination promptly to the Council for consideration of appropriate

                    <p>Since December, 1954, we have attempted to persuade other countries to
                        maintain the multilaterally agreed controls, even though it was already
                        apparent a year ago that other countries strongly believed the levels of
                        controls applicable to Communist China should be reduced to the level
                        applicable to the remainder of the Soviet Bloc. Notwithstanding our efforts
                        the pressures in other countries for revision of the China controls have
                        increased.</p>
                    <p>At Geneva I asked Foreign Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                            >Macmillan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> to
                        postpone consideration of revision of multilateral controls until the United
                        States had reached a more advanced point in discussions with the Communist
                        Chinese in Geneva. Both before and since these talks we have made
                        unremitting efforts through other available channels to persuade the
                        British, French and Japanese to hold the line.</p>
                    <p>The British response to our approaches definitively rejects our position and
                        puts us on notice of their intention to act unilaterally in early January
                        without observing the framework of multilateral procedures of the
                        Consultative Group in Paris. The Japanese had informed us previously that in
                        the absence of an agreement between the United States and Japan concerning a
                        list of items to be dropped from the controls, the Japanese would support
                        whatever position emerged in the Consultative Group as promising the maximum
                        reduction in the differential China controls.</p>
                    <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0308"/>
                    <p>We are therefore faced with the question whether to negotiate immediately
                        with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and such other countries as may
                        be necessary, to insure the continuance of the multilateral control
                        system—albeit at a reduced level in the case of China—or alternatively to
                        write off the <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> structure and attempt to
                        obtain satisfactory controls over trade by other means, e.g., bilateral
                        arrangements buttressed by US economic and political pressures.</p>
                    <p>I believe there is no effective alternative to a voluntary multilateral
                        control system. While bilateral pressures might coerce one or two countries
                        into a halfhearted compliance, they would only alienate others—and the
                        effectiveness of the system would be destroyed if one major producing
                        country refused to bow to our pressures.</p>
                    <p>For the foregoing reasons I must report, in accordance with the requirement
                        of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5429/5, that our efforts to maintain
                        the current differential export control towards Communist China have passed
                        the stage of being divisive; they present us with the prospect of total
                        disintegration of the multilateral control system.</p>
                    <p>To salvage this system we must accept a graduated reduction in the China
                        controls to a level which will gain mutual agreement among countries
                        participating in the Consultative Group. I recommend that I be authorized to
                        begin negotiations as soon as possible with the United Kingdom and other
                        interested countries as appropriate with the aim of preserving the
                        multilateral control system and, through its orderly procedures, to maintain
                        the controls over trade with China at the highest negotiable level but in no
                        event below the level of the Soviet bloc controls.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                        <p>“Dear <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Harold</persName>:</p>
                        <p>At the National Security Council meeting yesterday, I talked with the
                            President and the other members of the Council about the situation which
                            might result from your proposal unilaterally to remove articles from the
                                <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> trade control list.</p>
                        <p>There was a strong feeling, in which the President concurred, that if
                            there is unilateral action in these matters, the result will be not only
                            a collapse of the entire cooperative structure but also a high degree of
                            ill-feeling, as between our nations.</p>
                        <p>We are quite prepared to sit down and talk about the list, and no doubt
                            we can agree on some liberalization. I do, however, hope that you will
                            not make this a matter of unilateral action.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed the hope that we could talk this over when you
                            and Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">ANTHONY</persName> are here on
                            January 30. The purpose of our getting together is, I assume, to talk
                            over matters of mutual concern and try to reach common policies. It
                            would, I think, not be a very good prelude to this meeting, if, two
                            weeks before we met, your government took unilateral action on a matter
                            which is considered here, in governmental, Congressional, and public
                            circles, as being of the utmost importance.</p>
                        <p>I think it most desirable that you hold up any action until we can talk
                            it over. In the meantime we are prepared to have our experts sit down
                            with yours so that there will be some available data by the time you and
                            Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">ANTHONY</persName> get here.<note n="2"

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Herb</hi>: Your note requesting my comments on the
                        cables concerning the recent decision of the United Kingdom Government on
                        controls over trade to Communist China has raised many questions in my mind.
                        It seems to me that the British threat to unilaterally drop China controls
                        if the United States does not agree with them prior to January 15, 1956
                        cannot be considered solely as a trade control problem, but has much broader
                        implications for the United States and for the other countries engaged in
                        Mutual Security Programs.</p>
                    <p>The British action is extremely dangerous since it would undoubtedly weaken
                        the entire Security Trade Control Program. Their attitude appears to be
                        that, if they cannot achieve a relaxation of trade controls through
                        multilateral negotiation, they will unilaterally subvert the multilateral
                        control machinery in order to satisfy the commercial pressures which
                        strongly influence their security trade policies. The United Kingdom, or any
                        other major participating country, can achieve this purpose unilaterally.
                        Other countries have even greater interest and need for China trade than the
                        United Kingdom, but only the United Kingdom has threatened to act so
                        arbitrarily. If we adopt a conciliatory attitude toward the United Kingdom’s
                        threatened action, we can hardly expect the other participating countries to
                        believe that the United States Government seriously desires to promote the
                        security of the Free World through control of trade.</p>
                    <p>As you know, the controls over trade with Communist China are based on a
                        broad list of items encompassing most of the major industrial categories.
                        The Coordinating Committee (<gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>)
                        controls consist of a few items from each of the major categories which are
                        selected on the basis of very rigid criteria reflecting their relationship
                        to current military production activities, advanced technology, or
                        demonstrated deficiencies within the European Soviet bloc. Reducing the
                        China Committee (<gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>) controls to
                        the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> level would, therefore, release
                        for direct shipment to the Communist Chinese a great many items of key
                        industrial significance, such as electric-power equipment of small and
                        medium sizes; machine tools, except the very largest types; copper wire;
                        aluminum scrap; practically all types of transportation equipment, including
                            <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0311"/>cargo vessels; important types
                        of communication equipment; crude petroleum; mining and petroleum refining
                        machinery; construction machinery; general industrial equipment, including
                        most of the components for the output of steel, aluminum, copper, chemicals,
                        and other basic materials; and a host of other items. Making these available
                        for direct import from the Free World would materially aid the Chinese
                        Communists in their current efforts to expand military facilities for
                        aggression against Asiatic areas, including Formosa, as well as ease their
                        general economic situation.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the broader implications of the British proposal, I am sure
                        that current negotiations with the Communist Chinese at Geneva would be
                        jeopardized if it became known that trade was to be resumed by the Free
                        World without the slightest indication that the Communist Chinese intend to
                        modify their aggressive attitude. Surely, the political and economic impact
                        of the United Nations embargo on strategic trade, the <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> trade controls, the refusal to
                        admit Communist China to the United Nations, combined together, represent
                        effective pressure which the Communists strongly desire to have removed. If
                        a major one of these pressures is released without a commitment of any kind
                        by the Chinese Communists to alter their present aggressive courses of
                        action, the entire position of the Free World is then weakened. In view of
                        heavy United States military commitments in Asia and the need, in the event
                        of further aggression, to increase these commitments, I cannot view the
                        British action in this case as anything but detrimental to our security. I
                        realize, of course, that a choice must be made between this loss of
                        security, and possible injury to Anglo-United States cooperation which might
                        result from clearly labeling the United Kingdom threat as irresponsible. It
                        appears to me that the latter would be preferable in our present
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>It occurs to me that there is real danger that knowledge of British lack of
                        cooperation may cause Congress to restrict foreign aid appropriations and
                        thus hamper the continuation of an effective mutual defense system. I do not
                        suggest that this danger should be utilized as leverage with the United
                        Kingdom Government, since they generally react negatively to such leverage.
                        Nevertheless, this danger must be faced by the Administration.</p>

                            comments because I believe the indicated trend of events is of grave
                            significance to the national security of the United States. This
                            estimate concerns the effects to be expected if the recent United
                            Kingdom proposals relative to relaxation of trade controls with
                            Communist China are implemented. I fully concur with the thoughts
                            expressed in this estimate.</item>

                        <item>As you know, the United Kingdom has informed the United States that,
                            failing U.S. agreement in reducing the level of trade controls against
                            Communist China to the much lower level now in force against the
                            European Soviet Bloc, the United Kingdom intends a unilateral relaxation
                            of controls commencing about 15 January, 1956. Specifically, a <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> official has stated the intention of
                            that nation to take unilateral action and “ … by a gradual unobtrusive
                            process, over a period, bring the United Kingdom list for China into
                            conformity with the agreed list for the Soviet Bloc … ”<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d85fn3">Ellipses in the source text.</note> This proposed
                            action allegedly results from the stated view that the United Kingdom
                            can no longer see any strategic justification for continuing the present
                            level of Communist China trade controls. I am deeply concerned with the
                            military implications and the subsequent impact upon U.S. security which
                            I believe would result from any relaxation of trade controls with
                            Communist China at this time.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>On balance, I consider that such stability as exists in the Far East
                            today rests squarely upon the ability of the United States to convince
                            both friend and enemy that we are determined and resolved to resist
                            further Communist aggression in Asia, even by use of force if need be.
                            We have built up and are supporting necessary <pb n="281"
                                xml:id="pg_281" facs="0313"/>indigenous military strength in order
                            that certain free nations may be able to resist Communism with U.S.
                            assistance. In the face of growing Communist strength in Asia, it will
                            be increasingly clear to all that major aggression emanating from
                            Communist China can only be countered and defeated through active use of
                            U.S. military power. I believe that the greatest fear of our friends and
                            allies in the Far East is the possibility of a change in U.S. policy
                            which indicates a lack of resolution in this respect on the part of the
                            United States. In the case of Korea, we gave tangible evidence of this
                            resolution. Our continued support of some nations is further evidence.
                            However, it is the Asian estimate of U.S. intentions in the future to
                            deal with Communist aggression that will probably determine the
                            continuation and caliber of collective strength in free Asia.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>If the United States either adopts the course of action proposed by
                            the United Kingdom or condones the unilateral action of that nation, I
                            believe that our friends and allies of the Far East, together with the
                            world as a whole, would view this as prima facie evidence that this
                            government is retreating under Communist pressure. At a minimum, both
                            the Communists and our allies would consider, with some validity, that
                            this action represents a radical change in U.S. policy which clearly
                            facilitates the eventual Communist domination of all Asia. The facts are
                            that Communist China has been branded an aggressor by the United
                            Nations; the present controls on trade with Communist China stem from
                            that finding; Americans have been imprisoned and tortured in violation
                            of International Law and human decency; Communist China has publicly
                            identified the United States as its number one enemy; and as yet that
                            nation has not seen fit to adopt international procedures and attitudes
                            compatible with those recognized among the society of world nations. For
                            the United States to relax trade controls with a nation which is still a
                            technical enemy of the United States would be tacit forgiveness, if not
                            approval, of that nation’s actions and, in my opinion, would result in a
                            condition of hopelessness among those nations which depend primarily
                            upon us for their own security. I consider that any benefits which might
                            have been expected from <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> would be
                            nullified; the morale of strong anti-Communist forces in Asia would be
                            seriously shaken; U.S. prestige in Asia would reach a new low;
                            friendship with the United States could well become a dangerous
                            commodity; and the stoic temperament of the peoples of Asia would cause
                            them to seek an accommodation with the Communists—all to the detriment
                            of United States security.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Militarily speaking, then, I believe that the summation of the
                            foregoing could well result in a rapid deterioration of the active
                            indigenous military strength we have constituted in the Far East.
                            Sizable defections to Communism are a distinct possibility and <pb

                            tempo within a short time. This loss of friendly military strength in
                            the Far East would, I believe, eventually require significant increases
                            in our own military programs in order adequately to provide for U.S.
                            security and to prevent a complete loss of the balance of power in favor
                            of the Communists.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Some may think that eventual trade with and recognition of Communist
                            China is a certainty. The answer to this argument is simply—maybe;
                            however, the existing conditions in the world make it undesirable for
                            this action to take place now. It is possible, although not probable,
                            for changes to take place in the next few years in the imperialistic and
                            belligerent attitude of Soviet Russia and Communist China. I do not
                            believe that we can expect any improvement in this area if we now take
                            action which contributes to the increased strength of the threat against
                            us.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>I consider that the British proposals require a timely decision on the
                            part of the U.S. Government to adopt one of three possible courses of
                            action. These are: <list>

                                    <p>This action would be interpreted worldwide as a complete
                                        reversal of our foreign policy. I believe the repercussions
                                        would be monumental, not the least of which could be a
                                        serious political upheaval within the United States. The
                                        strongest anti-Communist nations of Asia, namely, the South
                                        Koreans and Chinese Nationalists, would view this action as
                                        a slap in the face. The effects upon U.S. leadership among
                                        the free nations of the world could well be
                                        catastrophic.</p></item>

                                    <p>While a decision along this line would be better than the
                                        first course of action; nonetheless, this course would
                                        facilitate improvement in the economical, industrial,
                                        military and political position of Communist China. Further,
                                        it would ease the drain on Russian resources required by
                                        China. This course of action would notify the world, which
                                        unfortunately includes enemies of the United States, that
                                        the first major rift in Western solidarity had occurred. In
                                        face of the propaganda and speculation to be expected, it is
                                        possible that the rift would widen. Nevertheless, free

                        <item>Finally, I believe the stated view of the United Kingdom, that it can
                            no longer see any strategic justification for continuing the present
                            levels of trade controls, is so significant as to require careful
                            examination and analysis. Taken at face value, this statement implies a
                            minimum of British recognition of the threat to United States security
                            posed by the dynamic communist Sino-Soviet alliance in the Far East.
                            Simply put, it means that the British desire for trade could be greater
                            than their anxiety for collective security. It seems to me that there is
                            also little recognition of the threat to Australia, New Zealand, and
                            Malaya. I believe that the U.S.–<gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>
                            alliance is of far greater importance to the United Kingdom than it is
                            to the United States. It appears that we should make every effort to
                            determine now the real strength of this alliance rather than at some
                            later date when any faltering or signs of weakness would be an even
                            greater blow to U.S. security. If the United Kingdom remains unconvinced
                            and actually initiates the proposed unilateral action, I believe it will
                            become necessary to re-examine completely the orientation of U.S.
                            foreign policy or initiate appropriate U.S. actions which will have the
                            effect of discouraging further British action in lowering controls. In
                            this field we have possibilities in the field of trade which if imposed
                            will have a great effect upon the British (for instance, reduction or
                            cancellation of export licenses from Hong Kong).</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>I conclude that the United States should consider firm measures to
                            deter the British from taking the course of action they propose. I
                            therefore recommend that this government adopt a strong position against
                            these British proposals and that this information be transmitted
                            forthwith to the United Kingdom. As a concurrent step, I would suggest
                            that the President request the British Prime Minister to delay any
                            further action concerning these proposals until they can be mutually
                            discussed during the Prime Minister’s forthcoming conference here in
                            late January 1956.</item>

                    <p>The Secretary said that the Committee he had appointed, chaired by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName>, to consider the
                        question of <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> Controls was not
                        with the idea that negotiations would start now. The purpose of the
                        Committee was to prepare for negotiations and develop a consolidated
                        American negotiating position. The job of the Committee, the Secretary
                        indicated, was to find out where we can give without hurting our objectives,
                        and particularly to give Japan some relief. He referred to G. I. sheets and
                        indicated that if these were to be supplied to Red China, Japan, not
                        Britain, should supply them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRB1">Robertson</persName> asked the Secretary
                        whether he had read his memorandum on the desirability of proceeding with
                        negotiations with Japan immediately.<note n="2" xml:id="d86fn2">The
                            memorandum of December 21 reads in part as follows: “I believe that our
                            best possibility for emerging from a Consultative Group meeting with a
                            China differential maintained is to enter that meeting with agreed
                            bilateral positions with as many <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>
                            members as is possible. The starting point for such bilaterals should be
                            Japan because of its recognized prime interest in this problem and
                            because its position is closer to ours than is that of any other major
                            nation.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 493.009/12–2155)</note> He
                        pointed out that the Japanese had been contacting us for some time now with
                        reference to the 111 items they would like to see eliminated from <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls. He emphasized that our
                        objective was to maintain multilateral controls at the highest levels we
                        could and that Japan of all the countries affected was closest to our
                        position. After a short discussion, the Secretary approved our negotiating
                        with the Japanese on <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls on
                        an exploratory basis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>’s
                        memorandum on <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0317"/>this subject was
                        called to the Secretary’s attention during the discussion and both he and
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRB1">Robertson</persName> indicated
                            concurrence.<note n="3" xml:id="d86fn3">In this memorandum to <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRB1">Robertson</persName>, dated December 21, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> expressed apprehension about
                            “reaching bilateral agreements with the Japanese for the deletion of
                            specific items in advance of agreement within the U.S. Government on our
                            tactics in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>”. He hoped <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRB1">Robertson</persName> could delay meeting with the
                            Japanese. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 611.94/12–2155)</note></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> pointed out the necessity
                        for changing the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> directive in order to
                        give us permission to negotiate reduction in the level of <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls as well as to provide
                        negotiating latitude. The Secretary replied that the President has taken
                        this over and that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> could not direct
                        the President what to do. He said that the letter which he had written to
                            <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> was in effect the
                        President’s letter and expressed his view. The <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> directive, therefore, should be brought into conformity
                        with the letter. He requested that this be done at the next meeting of the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then observed that in our discussions with the British we would
                        have to meet their point that all <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss> does is to let these embargoed commodities in at the
                        back door instead of the front door. He said before the President meets with
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>, the President
                        will want to know what items he can drop out of the <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> list without interfering with our
                        objectives too much; that this list on which we are prepared to yield should
                        be buttressed by strong reasons against reductions in other items. As for
                        the back door argument, the Committee should go into the question of delays
                        in deliveries, the status of transportation and the difficulties this causes
                        the Chinese, the extra costs involved, etc. He emphasized that we must have
                        strong defensive arguments and these arguments must be based upon facts.</p>

                        <item>The Committee recommended that the U.S. advise the United Kingdom that
                            the U.S. intends to make no change in its policy of complete embargo
                            against Communist China; and that the United States believes that the
                            Free World should at this time strengthen rather than soften the
                            multilateral export controls against Communist China, but if concessions
                            must be made to preserve the multilateral <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287"
                                facs="0319"/>control system, the United States should acquiesce to a
                            minimum reduction of controls confined to 19 items selected in part from
                            recent exceptions requested by Japan; and to an <hi rend="italic"
                                >exception</hi> for Japanese export of wooden fishing vessels which
                            are now being sold by Japan to Russia. As a corollary, the U.S. should
                            obtain British consent to the restoration of controls over copper wire
                            exports to the European Soviet bloc and the establishment of
                            quantitative controls over List II ships (merchant vessels). If the
                            British will not agree to either of the above positions, the Committee
                            recommended that the United States make no further concessions unless it
                            becomes apparent that the multilateral control structure will collapse,
                            in which event the United States position should be reviewed.</item>

                        <item>The second recommendation is supported by a position paper (Incl. 3,
                                <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> 501/8) which recommends
                            certain minimum reductions in the multilateral export controls only if
                            necessary to preserve the multilateral control system. Agreement on
                            minimum reductions could be sought on the basis of the level to which
                            Japan might agree plus other minimum reductions of interest to other
                            Consultative Group countries. It would be reasonable to meet the
                            Japanese requests because of Japan’s need for enlarged export markets,
                            because Communist China represents a nearby export market and source of
                            raw materials, because availability of a Communist Chinese market might
                            ease the pressure of Japanese exports on Free World markets, and because
                            Japan is most entitled to relief.</item>

                            Substantially Reduce Export Controls on East-West Trade</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>One point not mentioned in the discussion at yesterday’s meeting may suggest
                        the basis for a strong counter-argument.</p>
                    <p>Because of the totalitarian aspect of the Soviet Government, it can
                        arbitrarily extract a percentage from its gross national product in various
                        categories of production for sale abroad, regardless of domestic needs.</p>
                    <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0321"/>
                    <p>This is used as an aggressive threat to the economic, trade, and political
                        stake of the British and other European nations, in the Far East, the Middle
                        East, and Africa, which are areas of principal concern to the United States
                        and its Allies.</p>
                    <p>The substantial reduction already made in the level of the <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> controls, coupled with some degree of
                        evasion and weakness in implementation undoubtedly has contributed to the
                        Soviet ability to undertake in this economic offensive without too much
                        penalty on its domestic economy.</p>
                    <p>The further the Soviets go in their economic and trade offensive, the greater
                        the penalties should be on its domestic economy, unless the penalties are
                        relieved and the offensive is assisted by increased imports from the Western
                        Nations, which, in turn, can help increase the threat to their own economic
                        and political stake in the nations of these critical areas.</p>
                    <p>In the background are the obligations of the Soviets to help industrialize
                        and militarize China which any further substantial relaxation on trade
                        controls would facilitate. There have been continued Soviet offers of a
                        virtual trade monopoly for West Germany in the industrialization of
                        China.</p>
                    <p>For these reasons, the Soviet economic offensive can be strengthened and
                        assisted, and any economic counter-offensive by the Western Nations can be
                        weakened or made less effective, by a relaxation of the level of trade
                        controls.</p>
                    <p>The trade and political interests in these critical areas may be better
                        protected by increasing the level of controls and strengthening their
                            implementation.<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">On January 16, <persName

                    <p>1. International agreement to apply unified trade controls against the
                        European Soviet Bloc became effective in January 1950 with the formation by
                        the major Western allies of a Consultative Group to establish policies for
                        controls over trade with the Communist Bloc, and a permanent working group
                            (<gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>) to coordinate the application
                        of these policies. The members of this group were the US, <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Norway,
                        and Denmark; later West Germany, Canada, Portugal, Greece, Turkey, and Japan
                        joined. Cooperation with Austria, Sweden, and Switzerland was developed, and
                        to a lesser degree with nonparticipating nations receiving US aid.</p>
                    <p>2. In June 1950, mainland China and North Korea were brought within the scope
                        of the export controls exercised by the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> countries, and in December 1950 the US applied a complete

                        1951, US assistance may be extended only to nations which adhere to

                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls were applied to North
                        Vietnam as of 1 March 1955.</p>
                    <p>3. So long as hostilities in Korea continued, the above countries agreed to
                        maintain controls, though with varying degrees of enthusiasm. However, after
                        the end of these hostilities, and particularly after the Indochina armistice
                        of mid-1954, there was a growing belief among the allies of the US that
                        there were substantial prospects for a relaxation of tensions. In this
                        situation, differences of opinion concerning the appropriate level of
                        controls on Bloc trade became an increasing irritant in US relations with
                        many of its allies. In part to meet the objections of its allies, and in
                        part to devise a system of controls which could be implemented over the
                        “long haul,” the US in August 1954 consented to a reduction and revision of
                            <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> controls. But a decision
                        concerning a reduction of <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>
                        controls was deferred. However, sentiment continued to grow in many states
                        for a reduction of controls, and in December 1955 the British formally
                        notified the US that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would reduce
                            <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls to the <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> level, unilaterally if necessary.
                        Subsequently, in January 1956 the British proposed to the US that this
                        relaxation be made through a gradual process extending over a year. In
                        October 1955 the Japanese government informally approached the US government
                        with the suggestion that export controls on 111 items on the <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> list be modified substantially. On
                        15 December 1955, the Japanese submitted to the US their detailed arguments
                        for exceptions on 11 of these items.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">II. Attitudes Toward Trade
                        Controls</hi></p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Free World</hi></p>
                    <p>4. The attitudes of those Free World countries proposing a lowering of trade
                        controls are, although sincerely held, motivated generally by political and
                        economic considerations not necessarily in consonance with US views
                        regarding the security of the Free World. The Sino-Soviet Bloc tailors its
                        propaganda to exploit individual national sensitivities, economic problems,
                        and aspirations. It ties the issue of trade controls to propaganda stressing
                        world peace, Sino-Soviet <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0324"/>desire to
                        avoid war, and alleged US belligerence. To the extent that this propaganda
                        is accepted, various Free World countries find their arguments against trade
                        controls buttressed. In addition, a particular nation, even though feeling
                        no strong pressure for the reduction of trade controls, is almost certain to
                        oppose such controls when it learns that another nation is about to abandon
                        them and thus gain a possible preferred status. In the paragraphs which
                        follow, the attitudes of Free World nations toward trade controls are set
                        forth.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">The United Kingdom</hi>. Dissatisfaction with the
                        present system of trade controls is of long standing in the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and has steadily increased. Pressure has been
                        exerted on the government to sponsor liberalization of the whole range of
                        strategic controls, but it has been particularly insistent that the existing
                        differential restrictions on trade with Communist China be rescinded. The
                        predominant British view, both within and outside the government, toward
                        trade controls is that they should not be allowed to harden into a rigidly
                        prohibitive system and should be confined to items which are of demonstrable
                        importance to the military capabilities of the Soviet Bloc. The government,
                        while generally accepting the view that changes in present controls should
                        be the subject of international negotiation rather than unilateral action,
                        now contends that the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls
                        are both anomalous and ineffective. Moreover, the British now regard it as
                        unlikely that the Communists would offer any concession in return for the
                        relaxation of controls.</p>
                    <p>6. The British government’s opposition to present <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss> controls rests on the belief that the controls have
                        failed in their basic purpose of limiting the growth of Communist strength,
                        and at the same time have become counterproductive because of their divisive
                        effects on the Free World. The British have pointed out that the commodities
                        embargoed to the Chinese Communists can be, and are in fact, purchased via
                        the European Bloc countries. While the circumvention of controls in this
                        manner entails increased transshipment, transport, and in some cases,
                        purchase costs, the British contend that these are not of significant
                        magnitude. The British believe, on the other hand, that maintenance of these
                        controls is no longer in keeping with the developing political situation in
                        an era of “competitive coexistence,” and that it tends unnecessarily to
                        place the Western Powers in opposition to the policies of India and other
                        neutral states. They feel that a reduction of controls would improve the
                        Western position by offsetting Communist claims to be the sole promoters of

                    <p>7. Besides its assessment of the international political situation, the
                        position of the British government is influenced by the pressures of
                        commercial interests in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Hong Kong,
                        Singapore, and <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0325"/>Malaya and by the
                        growing concern for the Labor Party’s opposition on this issue. The <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> also contends that it may be possible to
                        weaken Chinese dependence on the Soviet Union. Certain <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> trade circles may also feel that a relaxation
                        of restrictions on Japanese trade with Communist China may serve to reduce
                        the pressure of Japanese competition with the British in other markets.
                        Although there is by no means general agreement that the <gloss

                        benefits from a reduction of the controls, the British would like to test
                        the potential of the Chinese Communist market.</p>
                    <p>8. Because of all these factors there is a dominant belief in the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> that the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss> differential should be eliminated, and the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will almost certainly push vigorously for
                        agreement to reduce controls to existing <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> levels. In any negotiations with the US, the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> position would be conditioned both by its own
                        need to retain the Anglo-American alliance and by its estimate that the US
                        has a similar, if less pronounced, need. In an effort to maintain unity, the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> might be willing to accept some sort
                        of compromise in which it would agree to make a limited tightening of <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> controls in return for the elimination
                        or substantial reduction of the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>
                        differential. However, if the US refused to consider the elimination or
                        major reductions of the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>
                        differential, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would probably gradually
                        relax its own differential controls on trade with Communist China unless it
                        came to believe that such action would have seriously harmful effects on
                        allied cooperation in general.</p>
                    <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Other Western European Countries</hi>. In general, these
                        countries also favor a relaxation of <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss> controls. France in particular has supported the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> position. The pressure for relaxation stems
                        in large part from industrial and business interests which are increasingly
                        concerned that competitors will exclude them from markets or obtain
                        preferred treatment by gaining the initiative. In addition there is
                        widespread hope, despite Soviet behavior since the Summit Conference, for a
                        broader understanding between the East and West. In the event the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> went ahead with the elimination of
                        differential trade controls without US concurrence, most of these countries
                        would be disposed to follow the British lead, as would Sweden, Switzerland,
                        and Austria, which are non-<gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>

                    <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Japan</hi>. In Japan, pressures within and without the
                        government for relaxation of controls remain strong, although there is
                        apparent recognition that such action would not lead to immediate large
                        economic gains. The Japanese position is based in part on a belief that
                        Japan cannot afford permanently to sacrifice its access to raw material
                        sources and its natural market in Communist China, and in part on the
                        Japanese desire for a greater independence of action in <pb n="294"
                            xml:id="pg_294" facs="0326"/>the conduct of its foreign policy. Japan
                        considers the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> differential
                        particularly disadvantageous to it since, unlike the trading countries of
                        Western Europe, Japan cannot as a practical matter transship goods to
                        Communist China through European Bloc ports. Given Japan’s over-all
                        dependence on the US, it would not directly oppose US efforts to maintain
                        differential controls but will continue to press for exceptions in its favor
                        to permit an increase in its trade with Communist China. Japan has indicated
                        that it would be willing to accept a partial modification of the existing
                        differential between <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls. In the event of US
                        refusal to agree to any modification, however, it is unlikely that the
                        Japanese government would consider it to be either politically feasible or
                        in the national interest to follow US leadership in maintaining a higher
                        level of controls than that adopted by other <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> members.</p>
                    <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Other Asian Allies</hi>. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                            >ROK</gloss>, Nationalist China, the Philippines, Laos, Cambodia, South
                        Vietnam, and Thailand continue to support the US on retaining controls on
                        Communist China’s trade, in part because of their own convictions and their
                        anti-Communist foreign policy, in part because US assistance is critical to
                        their economy and security, and in part because they see no great economic
                        advantage to themselves in freer trade with the Communist Bloc.</p>
                    <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Neutral Countries in the Middle East and Asia</hi>. In
                        general these countries believe that controls on the Bloc as a whole should
                        be reduced, and thus would favor the elimination of the <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> differential.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Sino-Soviet Bloc</hi></p>
                    <p>13. The Bloc has waged a consistent campaign against controls, most recently
                        in the 1955 negotiations of the Foreign Ministers at Geneva, with the stated
                        objective of securing the abolition of the entire strategic control system.
                        A significant part of this campaign reflects the deliberate exploitation by
                        the Bloc of the issue of controls to develop rifts among non-Communist
                        countries and to weaken the larger unity of purpose which makes possible,
                        among other things, the multilateral enforcement of the control system.
                        Controls appear to be associated in the minds of Bloc leaders with the
                        complex of Western defenses aligned against them. From their point of view,
                        the abolition of all controls, apart from the resulting economic benefits,
                        would also remove a psychological barrier to the fuller acceptance of Bloc
                        countries as members of the family of nations. They would also interpret the
                        abolition of controls as evidence of progress in their campaign to weaken
                        Western defenses.</p>
                    <p>14. While the abolition of controls is a continuing objective of Bloc foreign
                        policy, the Bloc is not likely to make any significant <pb n="295"
                            xml:id="pg_295" facs="0327"/>concession for their removal. Any action
                        short of the abolition of the entire strategic control system would probably
                        have little or no effect on the Bloc attitude toward controls. While Bloc
                        leaders might regard the elimination of the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss> differentials as a harbinger of better things to come,
                        they would probably not reduce the intensity of their campaign against
                        controls. Indeed, their efforts in this direction might be increased. In the
                        European Satellites, knowledgeable persons would interpret any net
                        concession to any Sino-Soviet Bloc country, even in the field of trade, as a
                        further Western acceptance of the status quo.</p>
                    <p>15. To the extent that Communist China’s economic dependence on the Soviet
                        Bloc was accelerated by Western trade controls, a potential source of
                        friction within the Sino-Soviet Bloc was created. However, there is no
                        evidence that any serious disharmony in intra-Bloc relationships has yet
                        been produced as a result of trade controls. Moreover, it is unlikely that
                        any increase in economic relations with non-Bloc countries, following any
                        relaxation of controls, would be of sufficient magnitude to alter Peiping’s
                        orientation to Moscow or weaken the solidarity of the Sino-Soviet
                        alliance.</p>

                    <p>16. Except in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, Taiwan, South Vietnam,
                        the Philippines, and Thailand, the reaction to US acceptance of a reduction
                        in controls would vary from indifference to the issue by some nations,
                        through general approval by others, to outright welcome by those with large
                        trading interests. It would be interpreted as an indication of US
                        willingness, despite serious misgivings, to accommodate its policies in some
                        degree to those of its allies. The reduction of controls with US consent
                        would tend to submerge temporarily a broad issue between the US and other
                        non-Communist nations which has been an irritant to our relations with our
                        European allies.<note n="5" xml:id="d90fn5">The Deputy Director for

                    <p>17. At the same time, US prestige would suffer in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                            >ROK</gloss>, Taiwan, South Vietnam, the Philippines, and to a lesser

                        would feel that the US had proved unable to maintain a firm anti-Communist
                        position in the face of pressure from weaker allies and that it had
                        accommodated indirectly to Communist demands. They <pb n="296"
                            xml:id="pg_296" facs="0328"/>would probably be more apprehensive over
                        future trends in US policy.</p>
                    <p>18. The Chinese Nationalists would be extremely bitter and their willingness
                        to accept US military and economic advice would probably be further reduced.
                        They might intensify military operations along the China coast and against
                        shipping. Although Nationalist morale would suffer and the Nationalists
                        would anticipate a further decline in their international position, it is
                        unlikely that US consent to elimination of the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss> differential would provide a sufficient shock to affect
                        seriously the stability of the Nationalist government. However, the action
                        would contribute to the present growth of Communist China’s prestige which
                        is making the maintenance of morale and loyalty on Taiwan increasingly
                        difficult.</p>
                    <p>19. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would strongly condemn any
                        failure of the US to oppose vigorously the elimination of <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls. It would view such
                        failure as a further indication that US support for a militantly
                        anti-Communist stand in Korea is unlikely. In spite of this opposition,
                        however, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> probably would not take
                        actions which would disrupt its basic ties with the US. Such a policy might
                        further exacerbate <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japanese relations.
                        The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would charge the US with acceding to
                        the “pro-Communist influence” of Japan and would fear the development of a
                        pro-Japanese bias in US policy.</p>
                    <p>20. The action would probably be regarded in Thailand as another indication
                        of relaxation in the US position on Communist China and would probably lead
                        to a corresponding relaxation in Thailand’s own anti-Communist posture.</p>
                    <p>21. While Chinese Communist trade with non-Communist countries would probably
                        increase after the relaxation of controls, at least within the next couple
                        of years such trade would be unlikely to develop in such a way as to permit
                        the Communists to exert a significant influence on internal political
                        developments or on the orientation of the governments. However, the freedom
                        of action and enhanced respectability and prestige conferred upon Communist
                        China by a lowering of controls would increase its potential for
                        politico-economic penetration to a greater degree than probably would be
                        indicated by the actual increase in the level of trade.</p>
                    <p>22. The largest expansion of Communist China’s trade would probably be with
                        Japan, and while not approaching prewar levels, this trade might in time
                        become an appreciable fraction of Japan’s total trade. Although Japanese
                        prospects for maintaining an expanding economy would continue to depend more
                        on trade with the non-Communist world than on its trade with China, this
                        latter trade, in which capital goods would be the predominant export, might
                        in time render some sectors of Japanese industry dependent on China as a
                        market.</p>
                    <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0329"/>
                    <p>23. We believe that Sino-Japanese trade during the next few years will not in
                        itself cause Japan to alter significantly its present orientation to the
                        West, barring a drastic curtailment of Japanese trade opportunities in the
                        Western world. Moreover, a relaxation of controls would to some degree
                        undercut one of the major points of attack of those Japanese who seek a
                        normalization of relations with the mainland, and would reduce an important
                        irritant in Japanese-US relations. At the same time, however, the relaxation
                        of controls would be interpreted in Japan as evidence that the US was moving
                        closer to an accommodation with Communist China and would probably stimulate
                        efforts both within and without the Japanese government for expanding
                        political relations with Peiping. The increase in trade would also provide
                        greater opportunities for various forms of Chinese Communist covert and
                        overt activities within Japan.</p>

                        Asia, would add weight to Bloc arguments that all “discrimination” in trade
                        should cease, and would tend to strengthen the present trend to seat the
                        Communist regime in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. It would also
                        make it more difficult for the West to oppose a move to repeal the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> embargo resolution. The increase in Communist
                        China’s prestige would probably be reflected in some increase of active
                        support among the overseas Chinese.</p>
                    <p>25. Elimination of the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>
                        differential would not affect Peiping’s foreign policy in any significant
                        manner. It would remove a bargaining counter of the West in dealings with
                        Communist China. Elimination of the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss> differential would not, of itself, materially affect
                        Communist China’s courses of action with respect to securing control of Hong
                        Kong or Macau, although it may make foreign occupation of these ports
                        somewhat less advantageous from the Chinese Communist point of view.</p>
                    <p>26. Elimination of the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>
                        differential would tend in the short run to reduce pressures for further
                        reductions in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> controls. Other
                        non-Communist governments would probably feel that the US had moved as far
                        as presently possible. Before long, however, pressures would again develop
                        for further reduction in Bloc controls, on the grounds that the controls do
                        not accomplish their intended purpose, are a bar to improved relations with
                        the Bloc, and work to the economic disadvantage of non-Communist states. The
                        trend toward the reduction of controls would almost certainly continue in
                        the absence of a serious crisis caused by Communist action in an area of
                        major importance to the Western Powers.</p>

                    <p>27. We believe that the effects described in paragraphs 16–26 would not be
                        affected materially if elimination of the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss> differential were accompanied by an agreement to
                        maintain <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> controls at present levels
                        for a limited period.</p>
                    <p>28. If the US secured a tightening of <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                        controls, however, there would be a number of differing effects which would
                        depend in part on the degree of tightening. In those areas where the US
                        would lose prestige in the situation discussed above, the adverse effects
                        might be somewhat mitigated. However, the issue of trade controls would soon
                        re-emerge as an important irritant, particularly in US–<gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US-Japanese relations. Within the space
                        of a year strong pressures would probably develop within the participating
                        countries to reduce the level of <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                        controls.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">V. Probable Political Effects If <gloss

                            US to Consent to Such Reduction</hi></p>
                    <p>29. If controls on trade with Communist China were lowered despite the
                        refusal of the US to consent to such a reduction, there would be mixed
                        reactions among the non-Communist states. There would be considerable
                        disappointment in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Western Europe, and
                        Japan that the US had failed to consent, because they would feel it
                        detracted from allied cooperation. US prestige would suffer somewhat among
                        the strongly anti-Communist states of Asia because of the failure of the US
                        to influence the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> states. There would
                        be increased fears that the US would be unable to rally allied support in
                        other projects to resist Communist pressures in Asia. At the same time,
                        these governments would probably derive some satisfaction and assurance from
                        the demonstrated determination of the US to maintain a strong position
                        despite pressure from other nations. India, Burma, and possibly other
                        neutral nations of Asia would probably openly condemn the US position.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The Belgian Ambassador recalled the many frank and useful conversations
                        between the Secretary and the Belgian Foreign Minister, Mr.
                            <persName>Spaak</persName>, and said that, in view of their past
                        discussions, Mr. <persName>Spaak</persName> had asked him to call on the
                        Secretary to convey the Belgian Government’s views on the question of
                        controls over trade with the Communist area. The Belgian Government had
                        decided to seek our reaction first before approaching other governments.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Silvercruys said that the problem of restrictions applying to
                        export of non-strategic items to Communist China has recently been under
                        review in Brussels. The situation was studied in relation to the limitations
                        agreed upon within <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>. As a result
                        of their study of the question—while maintaining their position in regard to
                        the necessities of keeping an embargo on all strategic materials and arms
                        deliveries in various forms—the interdepartmental Committee which conducted
                        the Belgian study strongly recommended that the matter be given a new
                        look.</p>
                    <p>Under present conditions, the Ambassador continued, there is a double
                        standard of controls—one applying to the Communist bloc in Europe, the other
                        to Communist China. Under <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                        regulations, while all items on the atomic list and the arms and ammunitions
                        list are entirely prohibited, a limited embargo is applied in regard to
                        non-strategic goods. This embargo operates within the frame-work of three
                        different lists—one list authorizing minor agreed exceptions, another list
                        authorizing certain exceptions within agreed quotas, the third list
                        authorizing certain deliveries under monthly control and check-up. Under the
                        regulations set up by <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>, however,
                        all these lists are merged in a single embargo which permits only limited
                        and agreed exceptions. Furthermore, there is a supplementary list which aims
                        at reinforcing the restrictive measures that are applied.</p>
                    <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0332"/>
                    <p>The discrepancies between these two sets of regulations—<gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss>—are causing a disturbing situation, the Ambassador
                        said. Some of the items embargoed by <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss>, in fact go to the Communist bloc in Europe, within the
                        regulations of <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>, and ultimately
                        filter to China. Furthermore, advantage is taken by nationals of other
                        countries whose Governments observe less scrupulously the obligations which
                        they have assumed. While they have meticulously honored their commitments
                        and taken effective measures to enforce the decisions agreed upon in <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>, the Belgian authorities are of the
                        opinion that present discrepancies are confusing and embarrassing and that
                        the continuance of the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>
                        embargo—in its present form—may result in penalizing Belgian industry and
                        commerce.</p>
                    <p>For these reasons, Ambassador Silvercruys stated, his Government has reached
                        the conclusion that the time has come for an up-to-date study of the
                        operation of <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> and the operation of
                            <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> with a view to seeking an
                        adjustment of the respective embargoes. The China embargo would thus be
                        adjusted within the general frame-work of the embargo against the Communist
                        bloc in Europe, while preserving the principle that the arrangement would
                        apply only to items, the nature, utilization and destination of which have a
                        clearly civilian character and to quantities that are reasonable under the
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador concluded by stating that his approach to the Secretary was
                        made in a spirit of mutual helpfulness and with the desire to keep the
                        closest contact with the United States on this matter as well as on other
                        matters of mutual concern and interest. To this end his Government wished to
                        explain this situation to the US Government and to seek its views prior to
                        initiating consultations with the members of the Consultative Group and to
                        having this Group entrusted formally with the matter.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary informed Ambassador Silvercruys that we have been giving fresh
                        study to this matter and, as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>
                        had expressed a desire to discuss it with him during his visit to
                        Washington, we expect to review the subject thoroughly with the British next
                        week. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to say
                        that our conclusion is that it would be wiser to hold to the present
                        controls even though it may seem unreasonable to keep the back door shut
                        when the front door is open, allowing goods to go through the Soviet Union
                        to Communist China. He emphasized, however, that this movement of goods
                        involves the Communist bloc in a heavy strain on its financial and
                        transportation capacities at a time when the Communist bloc is carrying on
                        an economic war against us. We doubt that this is the time to ease this
                        strain on their economies.</p>
                    <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0333"/>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that we have discussed this subject with the Japanese,
                        who are anxious to trade with China. The Japanese have a serious problem and
                        we must endeavor to help them find means for making their economic
                        livelihood. It may therefore prove to be in our common interest to ease
                        these restrictions in some small degree. However, the probablities for trade
                        are not likely to be large as the Chinese Communists do not have the
                        financial resources to cover any considerable volume of imports from the
                        West.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary concluded by stating that the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss> list probably deserves reconsideration from time to
                        time like the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> list. He feels it
                        would be desirable for us to reach some preliminary agreement with the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Japanese Governments. However, the
                        views of the Belgian Government deserve equal consideration, which they will
                        receive. He thought, however, that he should defer giving the Ambassador any
                        definite reply pending the conversations with Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>. The Secretary stated that he would
                        welcome any specific suggestions the Belgian Government might care to give
                        him on this subject before the meetings with Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>. He thought it would be useful to have
                        specific examples for their discussions.</p>

                    <p>At this point the President, noting that it was after eleven o’clock, asked
                        what items remained on the agenda. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1"
                            >Anderson</persName> replied that the final item, dealing with
                        multilateral trade controls, <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0334"/>was an
                        issue which the President wished to have decided before the arrival of the
                        British Prime Minister. Accordingly, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1"
                            >Anderson</persName> suggested a short break, after which the Council
                        would resume its meeting and consider this problem. The President, however,
                        asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> how long it would
                        take to present his report, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName> replied that it could be done in five or ten minutes.
                        Accordingly, the President decided to continue the meeting, and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> presented the gist of the
                        U.S. position with respect to multilateral controls on trade with Communist
                        China by reading to the Council the second paragraph of his memorandum of
                        transmittal dated January 13, 1956. He also pointed out that the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff recommended acceptance of the position of the United States
                        vis-à-vis the British proposed by the Council on Foreign Economic
                        Policy.</p>
                    <p>There was no disposition in the Council not to accept the position proposed
                        by the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>. The President, however, said
                        he had a remark to make. Some day, he said, he hoped that he would get a
                        study that he had asked for repeatedly. He had listened to many long
                        arguments as to how specific items sold to the Soviet bloc by the Western
                        powers could have very damaging security repercussions. However, the
                        President said, he had never seen a study of the net advantage or
                        disadvantage to the United States of trade with the Soviet bloc countries.
                        What he wanted to know was just what we were doing to ourselves with this
                        system of trade controls. It seemed to him that nobody had yet provided this
                        information to him, and here we were in this country, surrounded by a lot of
                        surplus materials which we would like very much to sell.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> inquired of Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> whether his study and
                        position paper had addressed itself to the problems which were faced by the
                        British and the Japanese. Did the present report contain an estimate of how
                        much the trade of these two countries with the Communist bloc actually
                        meant? We in the United States are much preoccupied today with the financial
                        and economic position of Japan and Great Britain. Would their financial and
                        economic problems really be relieved if they had their way in this dispute
                        and the controls on trade between them and the Soviet bloc countries were
                        drastically reduced?</p>
                    <p>In response to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’
                        query, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> pointed out
                        that the Commerce Department was frankly puzzled to explain why the United
                        Kingdom was seeking a reduction in the controls on trade with Communist
                        China at this precise moment in history when the British economy was running
                        at absolute capacity and when the British economy probably could not handle
                        additional orders from Communist China even if it got them. Moreover, China
                        has very little that the United Kingdom really needs. It was puzzling to <pb
                            n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0335"/>explain why the British were
                        insisting upon reducing the controls on their trade with Communist
                        China.</p>
                    <p>The President, enlarging on his earlier request for information, said that
                        what he was really seeking was an answer to this question: If there were
                        virtually no obstacles placed in the way of trade between the Soviet bloc
                        countries and the free world, what would this mean, in terms of dollars and
                        cents, first, for the United States and afterwards for its major allies? The
                        Congress so often seemed to feel that you only hurt the Communists when you
                        put obstacles in the way of trade between them and the free world. Perhaps,
                        however, we were actually hurting ourselves and our allies when we create
                        and maintain these obstacles. After all, the United States was beset with
                        such terrific surpluses in automobiles, wheat, cotton, and the like.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> replied that it was the
                        conviction of the Department of Commerce that all the Soviet bloc really
                        wants is to secure strategic items from the West—the very items which we
                        should not want to let them have.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> stated his belief
                        that it was the Board of Trade which was stirring up all this commotion in
                        England, because the manufacturing people were convinced of making fat
                        profits over the long haul by trade with the Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>The President complained again that no one had yet told him what this system
                        of trade controls was actually costing the United States and its allies. He
                        did not want any long and elaborate study. He did want a short one-page
                        memorandum which would cover all sides of the question.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that the
                        most important factors in this problem of trade controls with China were
                        psychological rather than strictly economic. Many people in the Far East
                        have come to believe that Communist China represented the wave of the
                        future. Seeming to grant concessions to the Chinese Communists would be
                        bound to result in spreading this conviction and thus in building up
                        neutralism in the Far East.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the discussion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                            Dulles</persName> read the estimate of the probable British attitude in
                        the forthcoming negotiations.<note n="3" xml:id="d92fn3">Not found in

                            <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0337"/>were perhaps more important
                        than the commercial ones. The commercial considerations were of course not
                        without importance. As he saw it, the problem was, “How are we going to hold
                        these detached insular positions at least until the evolution of Chinese
                        Communist internal policy makes the regime no longer hostile and no longer
                        to be feared?” Only by holding the strongest possible moral barriers against
                        the Chinese Communists would it be possible to maintain a defensive position
                        against them.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question from the Secretary, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> remarked that in connection with
                        the trade control question, the significance of the planned Chinese
                        Communist economic buildup should not be overlooked.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he wanted
                            <persName corresp="#p_RSL1">Sir Leslie Rowan</persName> to speak on the
                        economic consequences of the higher level of trade controls against
                        Communist China.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_RSL1">Leslie</persName> said that in the British
                        view the trade controls must relate to military objectives. Are the controls
                        effective from this standpoint? Was it justifiable to have different control
                        lists for two great areas which were contiguous? Do the China controls
                        prevent Communist China from getting rubber, for example, from the Soviet
                        Union? From a straight foreign trade standpoint, normal exports to China
                        were important to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. The <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had a long record of trade with China. It was
                        difficult to justify to British commercial interests a different embargo
                        list for Communist China from that for the Soviet Union. He did not put
                        primary emphasis on these points. His Government recognized the importance
                        of holding the rim in the Western Pacific. Possibly this could be done
                        through <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. From an economic standpoint
                        the British position in Malaya and Singapore was of fundamental importance.
                        The Malayan economy, and to a large extent the British economy, depended
                        heavily on exports of rubber. When the Malayans saw other countries
                        exporting rubber to Communist China, including a Commonwealth country—namely
                        Ceylon—and doing it notwithstanding the Battle Act, it was difficult to
                        justify a refusal to permit Malayan rubber to be exported to Communist
                        China. It is important to keep Malaya in the Western world, to keep Malaya
                        in the Commonwealth, and for the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, it is
                        important to keep Malaya in the Sterling area. If the Malayans as a result
                        of the trade controls against Communist China should say that they will
                        “look after themselves”—it would be a very serious matter for Britain. It is
                        especially difficult when it is necessary to require Malaya to prohibit
                        direct exports to Communist China.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_RSL1">Leslie</persName> asked if in following such
                        a policy we were not working directly contrary to the established political
                        policy? The Malayans with a low standard of living are required to make a
                        contribution to the effort against the Chinese Communists which is <pb
                            n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0338"/>contrary to their own inclination
                        and economic interest, and out of proportion to their resources. Sir
                            <persName corresp="#p_RSL1">Leslie</persName> said he should also
                        mention Hong Kong, which was greatly dependent on trade with China. It was
                        difficult when there was a common border between Hong Kong and Communist
                        China. He felt that the differential controls were also placing Japan in a
                        difficult position. He said he did not see how Japan could have any economic
                        future unless it traded with China. He thought we would have to authorize
                        such trade unless we were willing to continue to subsidize Japan. He knew
                        that Japan was buying coal from the U.S. while it could not obtain coal from
                        North China, but this high-cost U.S. coal would not enable Japan’s
                        industries to compete successfully in the world market. He said he felt that
                        by standing pat on a high level of controls for Communist China we were
                        working contrary to political and military objectives.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that the
                        danger of disintegration of the system of multilateral controls should also
                        be pointed out. He thought that if you do not follow a trade control policy
                        which would keep all the member countries with you, the system of
                        multilateral cooperation would break up and you would be worse off than if
                        you had modified your control levels. He felt that this was not just a
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> problem. The <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> economic interest, while important to it, was unimportant
                        compared to the wider aspect.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked about the rubber market situation in Malaya.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_RSL1">Leslie</persName> said that the price was
                        fairly good and considerable replanting was taking place.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if the economy of Malaya seemed to be suffering.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_RSL1">Leslie</persName> said that the economy was
                        bound to suffer some if you closed off a possible rubber market. He said
                        that the people of Malaya are subject to a restrictive control which is not
                        of their own making. They are required by outside authority to conform to
                        the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> control. He pointed out that
                        British policy was to keep ahead of the autonomy aspirations of colonies.
                        Imposition of export curbs on Malaya from London ran counter to this
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that
                        contacts between Malaya and Indonesia were of interest. He had recently
                        talked with an ex-Foreign Minister of Indonesia. Mr.
                            <persName>Marshall</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2"><persName>David
                                Marshall</persName>, Chief Minister of Singapore.</note> of the
                        Singapore Government had also talked with him. The practical point that
                        Indonesia was free to trade with Communist China as it wished had been made
                        by the Indonesian and had impressed Marshall.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question from the Secretary as to whether Indonesia exported
                        rubber to Communist China, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1"
                            >Robertson</persName> said <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0339"
                        />there had been no declared shipments. A clandestine movement of two
                        shiploads were suspected, but the Indonesians denied it. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RNA1">Robertson</persName> remarked that we had information
                        indicating that Communist China was reexporting some of the rubber it had
                        obtained from Ceylon to Czechoslovakia. Since Czechoslovakia could obtain
                        rubber directly from Southeast Asia, this might indicate some barter
                        arrangement.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said there would be no conclusions regarding the question until
                        the President and the Prime Minister talked about it. He suggested that the
                        question be passed over until the afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> asked Sir
                            <persName corresp="#p_RSL1">Leslie</persName> how much net increase he
                        thought there would be in the trade of Communist China if the controls were
                        reduced to the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> level?</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_RSL1">Leslie</persName> said he did not know. He
                        did not feel that anyone could make a sound estimate of the increase. The
                        issue was wider in his opinion. The effect on general relations with Malaya
                        would be good. If people felt they were unreasonably held back in their
                        trade relations, there would be resentment. A time might come when the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would be unable to hold the export
                        control line in Malaya. It would be very unfortunate if the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should be called on to use its reserve powers
                        in Malaya.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> asked if Sir <persName
                            corresp="#p_RSL1">Leslie</persName> felt that the trade increase which
                        would result from abolishing the differential would be consequential or
                        not?</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_RSL1">Leslie</persName> felt that the trade
                        increase would be of some consequence. He recalled that the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> had a long tradition of trade with China.
                        If there was any advance in the standard of living in Mainland China—even a
                        small increase—there would be a great increase in economic demand.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> pointed out that at
                        present there is a considerable transshipment of goods of western origin to
                        Communist China from the Soviet bloc in Europe. He asked if a lowering of
                        controls would result in an actual increase in the volume of trade or would
                        there merely be a rerouting of the same goods?</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_RSL1">Leslie</persName> thought there would be some
                        actual increase in other goods. More merchandise would come in. There would
                        be new lines of commodities and new routes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> remarked that a change in
                        the source would not necessarily increase the overall intake. He thought the
                        total intake might be about the same.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> pointed out, as
                        an example of the domestic difficulty encountered by the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, a recent layoff of workers at a truck plant
                        in England. The factory could have sold trucks to Communist China, which
                        would have kept the employees <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0340"
                        />working full time. The men were naturally asking why export orders could
                        not be accepted which would give them full employment. The discussion of Far
                        Eastern matters terminated at this point.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">China Trade Controls</hi></p>
                    <p>The President presided and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                            >Eden</persName> headed the British Delegation.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the President had arrived, the Secretary of State broached the
                        problem of China trade controls. He summarized the discussion of this
                        subject which had taken place between himself and Foreign Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName>, together with their advisers,
                            <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0341"/>during the morning conference.
                        The Secretary said that he had painted the broad United States approach to
                        the whole China problem and on the subject of trade controls had indicated
                        the United States belief that we tend to collapse our position if we should
                        reduce the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls. He
                        indicated that the morning discussion had also touched on the problem of
                        rubber trade, particularly in relation to Ceylon and Malaya.</p>
                    <p>The President then broke in to say that he felt that if we did not let Japan
                        trade with Communist China, we would be in for serious trouble. At the same
                        time, he said, our people, especially Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName>, think that any weakening on our part, either with
                        respect to our economic pressures or our political pressures, would be
                        extremely bad for our position in Asia. The only thing we have out there,
                        the President said, is our reputation for standing by our word. If we begin
                        to pull back and to raise doubts whether we will stand by our moral
                        positions and support other peoples, the Asians, according to Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>’s evaluation, will leave
                        us like flies.</p>
                    <p>The President admitted that he did not see how to correlate this appraisal of
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>’s with the Japanese
                        problem. Likewise, in connection with rubber, if we let one country sell
                        rubber to Communist China, it would seem that we should let others do
                        so.</p>
                    <p>The President said he had lots of studies going forward on these problems,
                        but as of now he did not see how to straddle them.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said that he had
                        two problems: There was the question of United Kingdom trade, but this trade
                        with Communist China was not really important. On the other hand, the trade
                        of British Colonies was more important. He pointed to the posture of Ceylon,
                        noting that Ceylon had flouted the United Nations embargo against Communist
                        China with respect to rubber and yet on all other counts was one of the most
                        anti-Communist of all nations. The incongruity was deepened then when you
                        considered Malaya, which was restrained from trading in rubber with
                        Communist China, notwithstanding the case of Ceylon.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said that what he
                        proposed was to drop part of the China list now; the rest could be dropped
                        later so long as we show now the thing is moving along.</p>
                    <p>At this point the President inquired why rubber was still considered so
                        strategic in view of synthetic production.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Robertson</persName>, of the Defense
                        Department, replied that the Russian synthetic industry was not sufficiently
                        large to supply their demands.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> pointed out that
                        there was no restriction on Russian purchases of rubber from the Free World.
                        All I am trying to do, he said, is to get these control lists nearer
                        together.</p>
                    <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0342"/>
                    <p>The President asked the Prime Minister what else he would want to take off
                        the China trade control list besides rubber.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> alluded to a
                        number of priority items and handed the President a list of them (this list
                        is the one attached to the United Kingdom aide-mémoire recently delivered by
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJE1">Coulson</persName> to Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d88fn4">footnote 4, Document 88</ref>.</note> The list
                        sets out the items under China control which the British propose removing
                        from such control during the first six months of a period of proposed
                        alignment of the control lists).</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> commented that all
                        the items set out on the list he handed to the President already stood free
                        of control to Soviet Russia.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether the Communist Chinese did not have to pay for the
                        things which they imported—whether they did not have to devote materials and
                        resources to such procurement. Who does this trade help the most, the
                        President asked.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> pointed out that the
                        Communist Chinese were struggling to industrialize and to accomplish this
                        change in their economy rapidly. In this connection they were desperately
                        eager to procure many industrial items now embargoed by the differential
                        controls. It was felt, therefore, that in the light of this need, the net
                        gain in such trade would be greater for the Chinese Communists.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that we were trying hard to help Indochina, Burma and
                        other countries in Southeast Asia, and it might help them economically if
                        they were able to sell to Communist China various raw materials which he saw
                        noted on the Prime Minister’s list.</p>
                    <p>The President then said to the Prime Minister that we have a number of
                        inter-departmental committees which study these problems, that one of them
                        is chaired by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Joseph Dodge</persName> and
                        that he would like to have the opportunity to give Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s list to Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> and to ask him what the removal of
                        these items from control would mean, both to the Communist Chinese as well
                        as to the Free World. In particular the President said he would like to know
                        what items on this possible de-control list would favor Japan. When he had
                        the answer to these questions, we should take a look at the problem to see
                        what we can do.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then said that there
                        were several points of concern to him which related more to method. First,
                        he felt that the study of the list and of these problems should take place
                        at the staff level. Secondly, any action that might be taken toward
                        de-control ought to be accomplished on a gradual basis, so as to avoid any
                        indication that we have undergone a change in political attitude. In <pb
                            n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0343"/>the third place, in our control
                        system against the European Soviet bloc, we have employed various types of
                        control, and the Secretary asked whether we might not draw from those
                        principles in relation to China. Specifically, he inquired whether we might
                        not use quantitative controls on some of the items.</p>
                    <p>When the Secretary alluded to the types of control applied in <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>, the President interjected a comment on
                        copper wire, which he said he noted had been getting out of control.
                        Reference was then made to rubber, and Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> indicated that a quantitative control
                        system for rubber could be managed by the United Kingdom. The President
                        commented that we could then assign a quantity to Malaya for export.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that we
                        were now in the position of wanting to aid Ceylon economically, but that we
                        had the problem raised by our legislation, and it was indeed ironical that
                        we were hampered in sending aid to Ceylon, who, as Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had pointed out, was so thoroughly
                        anti-Communist.</p>
                    <p>The President noted somewhat jocularly that his Secretary of Commerce
                        doubtless would complain about a reduction in the international controls,
                        since he frequently pointed out the discrimination against American
                        businessmen which resulted from the fact that we maintained a complete
                        embargo against Communist China while other countries permit their
                        businessmen to conduct trade within certain limits.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                            >Eden</persName> what Malaya might expect to receive from Communist
                        China in return for rubber. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                            >Eden</persName> said he did not know, but possibly it would be rice,
                        soybeans and other food products. Malaya, he said, did not produce very much
                        food.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> jokingly commented
                        that if Malaya were short of rice, we had a little too much of that
                        commodity and would be glad to supply it, and at a very cheap price too. He
                        then went on more seriously to say that Communist China was short of foreign
                        exchange and probably would wish to barter, in which case they would
                        probably offer food, letting their own people starve.</p>
                    <p>The President then turned to the Secretary of State and said, “This is what I
                        want you to do; get in everyone, get in the Defense people and the others,
                        and see what we can do to back away from this thing”.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said there was one
                        further point that he wanted to cite to illustrate his concern. This was the
                        case of Hong-Kong, where the population has been greatly swelled by the
                        movement of refugees and where the whole life of the colony and its ability
                        to feed this large population depended on foreign trade.</p>
                    <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0344"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then asked Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> whether he would agree
                        to the gradual basis for any action in reducing the trade controls. The
                        Prime Minister replied that he did agree and that all he wanted was to get
                        the matter moving. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        said it would be very important to avoid any indication that there has been
                        a change in policy. The President said that our technical experts were
                        studying these matters all the time and making adjustments in controls.
                        Surely we cannot say that we made a flat decision in 1952 that cannot be
                        altered in any detail.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> again stressed that
                        it would be important not to let the press give the impression that we had
                        made a change of position.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> also pointed to the
                        importance of working out the action to reduce the controls on a
                        multilateral basis. The President echoed this thought and stressed the
                        importance of getting the Japanese representatives into the formulation of
                        the adjustments.</p>
                    <p>With respect to any publicity, the President then said we should make the
                        answer that we have made no change in our general policy, but that we have
                        turned the problem over to the experts to see if any actions beneficial to
                        the Free World can be made within the four corners of that policy. We are
                        then going to see what the technicians say to this.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> commented that he
                        was old-fashioned enough to believe that trade was good for people; surely
                        the United Kingdom had not lost through the development of trade.</p>
                    <p>The President responded that he recognized that a desperate need on the part
                        of the Chinese Communists for particular items might make a difference in
                        the appraisal as to where the balance of advantage might lie in a particular
                        course of trade. He, himself, was always trying to ascertain what that
                        balance of advantage was. He did not wish to help the Communist Chinese, but
                        he did wish to help ourselves.<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">Another memorandum

                        <p>The elimination of trade controls against the Soviet Bloc for all
                            commodities, except arms and atomic energy materials, might result in an
                            annual increase of Free World exports to the Bloc of as much as $350
                            million. About $150 million of this increase would result from the
                            relaxation of the differential controls against China. However, if the
                            United States maintained its unilateral controls, the increase in trade
                            attributable solely to the differential China controls would be in the
                            neighborhood of $60 million assuming there were no significant extension
                            of Western long-term credits.</p>
                        <p>The increased trade resulting from the elimination of virtually all
                            controls, though amounting to about 15 percent of the present level of
                            Free World exports to the Soviet Bloc, would be very small in relation
                            to total Free World trade. <hi rend="italic">Such an increase is too
                                small to he of significant economic benefit to the Free World as a
                                whole; although to a number of business firms, particularly in
                                Japan, this improvement in trade would be important.</hi></p>
                        <p>Since the imposition of trade controls, the Soviet Bloc has continued to
                            develop a rapidly expanding capability to export many commodities in
                            categories similar to those being controlled by the Free World. While
                            Bloc imports of industrial equipment, chemicals and petroleum products
                            remained relatively constant during 1953–56, Bloc exports of such goods
                            have increased very substantially during the same period from a low
                            initial level. Although Bloc trade with the West is relatively small,
                            the Bloc has a rich natural resource base comparable to that of other
                            major industrial states and it is now supplying some of the industrial
                            requirements of Western countries.</p>
                        <p>The elimination of virtually all trade controls would probably lead to
                            some increase in total Bloc purchases, particularly of certain metals,
                            ships, electronics and other complex industrial equipment. Bloc demand
                            for such complex industrial equipment would be confined to relatively
                            few categories since most of it is not included in the relatively narrow
                            range now effectively embargoed by the West.</p>
                        <p>The relative self-sufficiency of the Bloc’s economy is the result of
                            years of Soviet policy directed toward autarky stimulated to some extent
                            by over five years of Western trade controls. If the Bloc chose <pb
                                n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0347"/>to revise this policy, it could
                            generate and pay for an increase in imports from the West of as much as
                            one billion dollars annually without adverse and possibly with
                            beneficial effect on the Bloc’s other long-range economic plans. Such a
                            change in policy could be adopted by the Bloc within the pattern of Free
                            World trade controls. However, it is not considered likely that the Bloc
                            would in fact change its policy of present limited trade with the Free
                            World even if virtually all trade controls were eliminated, except
                            possibly as it might find it desirable to do so for political
                                reasons.<note n="6" xml:id="d95fn6">On February 13, <persName

                            <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> discussed the recent

                        controls. He explained that during those talks the President informed the
                        Prime Minister that he would submit the list of items that the British had
                        proposed for decontrol to <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> as
                        Chairman of the Council on Foreign Economic Policy. “The President
                        indicated,” <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> noted, “that the
                        purpose of this reference would be for the U.S. experts to examine the
                        British proposals, and their implications, as well as other aspects of the
                        problem, and make recommendations as to whether adjustments to the net
                        benefit of the Free World could be made in the embargo lists within the
                        continued application of the basic policy to maintain substantial
                        differential controls through the multilateral control organization.”
                        (Department of State, Central Files, 493.009/2–1056) The British list of
                        items for decontrol was identical to the list presented in the aide-mémoire
                        of January 3.</p>

                    <p>On February 15, the Senate Permanent Investigations Subcommittee opened
                        public hearings on the revision of the Battle Act and International Lists

                        permitted shipment strategic commodities to European Soviet bloc and that
                        decisions within U.S. executive branch which resulted in 1954 deletions were

                    <p>The Ambassador referred to the discussion of this subject during Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s visit and, a good
                        deal of time having passed, asked when the British could hope to have our
                        comments on the list which they had given us. Sir <persName
                            corresp="#p_MSR1">Roger</persName> also asked if we would have any
                        objection to their giving the same list to the French.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSR1">Roger</persName> said that there was a good
                        deal of pressure to fix a date for the next meeting for the Consultative
                        Group in Paris.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he thought there was no reason for delaying the
                        fulfillment of the commitments made during the <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                            >Eden</persName> visit and there was no intention on our part in
                        engaging in delaying tactics. However, the issue was a complex one and he
                        would in any case see that word was got to the British as soon as
                        possible.</p>

                        to consider the subject of modifying <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss>
                        <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0350"/>Trade Controls, as proposed by the
                        British and discussed at the time of Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s visit.</p>
                    <p>Acting under the terms of the memorandums of discussion, an intensive study
                        has been made of the items on the differential list submitted by the
                        British, to determine the implications, at home and abroad, of any changes
                        in the control status of each of these items. This determination is
                        fundamental to any proper consideration of possible changes and subsequent
                        Group negotiations with respect to them. The report is due March 1st. Based
                        on this analysis and appraisal, possible modifications then will be
                        considered, item by item.</p>
                    <p>Under any circumstances, it would be essential that any positions taken by
                        the United States receive adequate and careful consideration. But,
                        unfortunately, in this instance, there is serious complication in addition
                        to the usual problem of determining the facts and an internally agreed U.S.
                        position.</p>
                    <p>Since the general announcement that such a modification would be considered,
                        it has been under almost continuous public criticism. In the Congress there
                        has been an attack on the general revision of controls of exports to the
                        Soviet Bloc put into effect on August 16, 1954.</p>
                    <p>Recent evidence can be found in a speech by Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName> on the floor of the Senate,
                        Thursday, February 23, 1956, reported in the <hi rend="italic">Congressional
                            Record</hi> of that date at page 2771. He spoke on East-West Trade, and
                        criticized the relaxation of trade controls that occurred in August 1954,
                        based on executive and public hearings of the Senate Permanent Investigating
                        Subcommittee, of which he is Chairman. The Chairman of the Armed Services
                            Committee<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2"><persName corresp="#p_RRB2">Richard
                                B. Russell</persName> (D.–Georgia).</note> and other members of that
                        Committee participated in the discussion. The Committee investigation is
                        continuing.</p>
                    <p>For this reason, and at this time, any position the U.S. may take on the
                        proposal must receive especially careful consideration.</p>
                    <p>I believe that too hasty or ill-considered action could be used to embarrass
                        the Government program of assistance to other nations, not yet approved by
                        the Congress. And, under these circumstances, I further believe the U.S.
                        position will have to be that we can agree to a date for a Consultative
                        Group meeting only when every aspect of the U.S. position has been developed
                        and considered in terms of the <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0351"/>need

                    <p>Sir <persName>Hubert</persName> said that it was six weeks since the word
                        “now” had been used. Ministers were being pressed in the House, where a
                        number of questions on this subject would have to be answered during the
                        next week. Illustrating this pressure, Sir <persName>Hubert</persName> said
                        that the President of the Board of Trade had been obliged to say the other
                        day in the House that he was giving consideration to publishing the China
                        differential list. (He did not raise the point which Sir <persName
                            corresp="#p_MSR1">Roger</persName> raised with the Secretary on February
                        28, as to our opinion on their desire to give the French Government a copy
                        of the list which they had given us before the <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                            >Eden</persName> talks.) Sir <persName>Hubert</persName> said that the
                        British Government was also under a great deal of pressure at all the
                        capitals of the <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> countries. There was
                        particular pressure from the French, Japanese and Danes. He asked me if I
                        could tell him how the review of the <persName corresp="#p_DJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName> Council was progressing and when we thought we would

                    <p>I reviewed with Sir <persName>Hubert</persName> various offices in the
                        Department concerned with this subject and said that, while <gloss
                            target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> had a natural interest in it because of its
                        effect on our relations with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>, I
                        understood that the Secretary had assigned responsibility for handling it to
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName>, both as regards action
                        within the United States Government and action with other governments. I
                        said that, although I knew of certain steps being taken in consideration of
                        this very complex matter, I was not sufficiently familiar with them to <pb

                        I said that I was afraid that, under these circumstances, anything which I
                        said would confuse rather than clarify the issue.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName>Hubert</persName> said he understood this but said the
                        Ambassador had suggested he come to see me since I had been present when his
                        Ambassador saw the Secretary on February 28 and had been assured by the
                        Secretary that he would see that word would be got to the British
                        Embassy.</p>
                    <p>I said that I would be glad to make arrangements for him to see Mr. <persName

                    <p>While US has agreed to review China embargo list to determine what
                        adjustments can be made which would be beneficial to Free World and without
                        balance advantage to Chinese Communists, this agreement does not reflect any

                        including differential toward Communist China.</p>
                    <p>US appreciates fact that uncertainty or confusion concerning national trade
                        control policies of member governments may have resulted during recent
                        months in lessening the vigor of <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"

                        and in reducing the degree of international cooperation previously exhibited
                        in that forum. US continues to feel strongly that there is sound strategic
                        and political basis for maintenance of security trade controls applicable to
                        Soviet bloc (including a substantial differential toward Communist China)
                        and that these controls can be administered effectively only by strong

                        controls has reached alarming proportions. Communications from London and

                        level. Both governments have recently given repeated <pb n="323"

                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>Despite earlier hopes that the Mollet government would take a more moderate
                        stand, the French have now indicated they are determined to equalize <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> controls at the lower level. French intransigence is
                        further indicated by 1) the decision to ship a minimum of 14,300 tons of
                        iron, steel and tin plates to Communist China and possibly 6,000 tons more;
                        2) possibly shipping $8 or $9 million of other China embargo goods; 3)
                        shipping trucks to North Vietnam; and 4) considering the placement of a
                        trade representative in Peiping and allowing a Chinese Communist trade
                        representative in Paris.</p>
                    <p>Since February the British Embassy has asked at least four times for U.S.
                        action on discussing the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> issue
                        and setting a date for the <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> meeting. On
                        March 27, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> delegate in <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> delivered a particularly bitter
                        rebuttal to U.S. objections to shipment of certain British laboratory
                        chemicals to China stating that the China controls were devised to meet the
                        temporary condition of a local hot war and were not intended as long-term
                        measures to inhibit China’s industrial and scientific advance. The Danish,
                        Japanese, French and German delegations promptly agreed that the present
                            <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls exceed their
                        original objective. The Danish delegate plead for a prompt discussion of

                                >Ibid.,</hi> 493.419/3–2756)</note> On March 23 the British
                        Government agreed to export 100 agricultural tractors to Communist China,
                        having pared down an original request for the export of 1,700 tractors, and
                        cited this as an example of heavy pressure in Parliament, press and
                        commercial circles for relaxation of controls.</p>
                    <p>The latest available information indicates that the Netherlands and Portugal
                        would also favor reduction of <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>
                        controls to the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> level and that
                        Belgium, Canada, Italy and Norway favor reduction although not necessarily
                        to the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> level. Of the 15
                        participating countries in the <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>, it seems
                        that only Greece and Turkey will likely provide strong support for the U.S.
                        position favoring maintenance of a significant China differential (unless we
                        can satisfy the Japanese with moderate concessions) but unfortunately these
                        two nations have a comparatively small voice in <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"

                                    <item>The Committee has been told repeatedly that the reason we
                                        cannot make the control list public is that, in order to get
                                        a voluntary system of strategic controls in the first place,
                                        we had to agree with 14 of our allies that we would keep it
                                        on a classified basis. Publication of the list would make it
                                        difficult for some of the cooperating governments to
                                        continue to resist internal and external pressures for
                                        further reductions.</item>

                    <p>Apropos of Indonesian purchases of rice from Burma and Thailand, the
                        President said he wished to make a comment, part of which would be familiar
                        to the National Security Council. He went on to point out that the United
                        States takes the position that it will not trade with the Soviet bloc.
                        Having taken such position, we proceed to dispose of our agricultural
                        surpluses to countries which have normally been the markets for countries
                        friendly to the United States. This course of action worsens the
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out to the
                        President that we did not supply a country like Indonesia with our surplus
                        rice until Indonesia had already purchased its “normal quota” from
                        traditional suppliers like Burma. The President added that in any case our
                        disposal of agricultural surpluses should not be permitted to trouble the
                        normal trade relationships between countries friendly to us. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then referred briefly to
                        the difficulties encountered with the Congress in the matter of our large
                        surplus food products, and also pointed out that the Soviets bought the
                        surplus products of underdeveloped countries primarily for political
                        reasons.</p>
                    <p>At this point the President said he wanted to tell the members of the Council
                        about a recent visit of Bernard Baruch.<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">Former

                            facs="0363"/>come to see him, said the President, primarily to challenge
                        us on the whole program for the development of our missiles. When the
                        President had completely satisfied Baruch as to the extent of the
                        Administration’s program, Baruch had suddenly switched the conversation to
                        this matter of world trade. He had expressed the opinion that the world
                        would be much better off if the United States completely removed all of its
                        existing barriers to trade. The President said that this was such a complete
                        reversal of Baruch’s previous views on this subject that he had been
                        absolutely astonished. Nevertheless, continued the President, the National
                        Security Council was well aware of his own opinion that, in the matter of
                        setting up so many barriers to the free flow of trade, the United States was
                        in point of fact cutting off its nose to spite its face.</p>
                    <p>When the President had finished, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> said that the President’s remarks brought to mind a
                        matter which he had spoken about in the Council some weeks ago. He referred
                        to his suggestion at that time that the United States might cause a great
                        deal of difficulty to the Soviet Union if it were suddenly to offer to
                        Czechoslovakia a large amount of surplus U.S. agricultural commodities. So
                        far as he knew, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, nothing had ever come of this suggestion, and he
                        presumed that it was buried somewhere in the depths of the government
                        bureaucracy.</p>
                    <p>The President said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>’ complaint reminded him of the irritation of General
                            <persName corresp="#p_PMGWB1">Persons</persName>, who had unburdened
                        himself to the President very recently. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_PMGWB1">Persons</persName>’ conviction was that while
                        Administration officials down to the Assistant Secretary level were loyal
                        and reliable, there were below this level a number of career officers who
                        defeat and frustrate the policy recommendations of their superiors. These
                        people were often in quasi executive positions, and General <persName
                            corresp="#p_PMGWB1">Persons</persName> said he had a list of the
                        offenders which he would be discussing with the heads of the Executive
                        departments and agencies.</p>
                    <p>Reverting to the previous subject, the President then qualified his statement
                        urging the removal by the United States of all trade restrictions. He
                        admitted that not all restrictions could be removed, but the United States
                        should nevertheless do everything that it could, for example, to encourage
                        Japanese trade with Japan’s neighbors, including Communist China.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that of course
                        in Defense we were “a little emotional” on this matter of East-West trade.
                        He had come, he said, to feel that there were only two really tenable
                        positions to take on U.S. trade with the Soviet bloc. Either we should not
                        trade with the Soviet bloc at all, or else we should adopt a fairly liberal
                        trade policy with the bloc. The middle ground of juggling lists of
                        controlled items was very difficult. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> added that of <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0364"
                        />course he meant that we should continue to embargo the sale of arms and
                        armaments to the Communist nations. What particularly worried him at the
                        moment was the amount of copper and of electronics machinery which was
                        reaching the Soviet bloc from the West.</p>
                    <p>The President wondered whether it would not be useful to decontrol everything
                        except perhaps such vital commodities as copper and a few others. Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed out that at the
                        present time the U.S. list of controlled items for trade with the Soviet
                        bloc contained nothing but strategic materials. For example, all
                        non-strategic goods were flowing between Japan and her neighbors. Our
                        pressures on Japan were not restricting the exchange of consumers goods.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> reiterated that he
                        was “burned up” by the trade our allies were conducting with the Soviet bloc
                        in copper and electronics machinery. He advocated that the United States
                        should concentrate its efforts on preventing such sales to the Communist
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>The President then turned to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                            Dulles</persName> and inquired whether the Central Intelligence Agency
                        kept itself regularly informed on the flow of trade throughout the world.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> replied that the <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> did keep careful track of the trade of the
                        Soviet bloc, but that responsibility for tracing the flow of free world
                        trade belonged to the Departments of State and Commerce. The President
                        thereupon asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> whether,
                        in conjunction with State and Commerce, he could provide the National
                        Security Council with a 20-minute presentation on the general flow of world
                        trade, both trade among the free world nations and between the free world
                        and the Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> referred to the fact
                        that the President frequently asked the question of what the United States
                        received in return for the products and economic assistance which it gave to
                        friendly nations. For example, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName>, what specifically does the United States receive in
                        return for the $97 million worth of surplus agricultural commodities which
                        we were providing to Indonesia as indicated by the current Progress
                            Report?<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3">Reference to a Progress Report dated
                            March 26, not printed, which was discussed earlier in the
                            meeting.</note></p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> undertook to answer
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>. He stated that in
                        return for the $97 million worth of commodities the United States received
                        soft Indonesian currency, which we proceeded to give back to the Indonesians
                        to assist their economic development programs. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> went on to point out that the
                        Secretary of Agriculture was desperately searching for places all over the
                            <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0365"/>world in which he could dump
                        our agricultural surpluses without actually hurting anybody in the process.
                        This was an impossible objective. One could not dump these surpluses without
                        doing some degree of injury to somebody.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then raised the
                        question as to whether it would not be advantageous to approach the British
                        with the suggestion that we store in Great Britain a certain amount of our
                        surplus food products. In the event of a future war the British people might
                        very well starve if the sea routes were not kept open. It would accordingly
                        be advantageous, both to them and to us, to have food reserves stored in the
                        United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJS1">Lay</persName> pointed out that the study of
                        the levels of trade between the free world and Communist China, undertaken
                        by the Council on Foreign Economic Policy, was about ready for Council
                        consideration. He suggested that this report be considered on April 19
                        together with the new report which the President had just asked Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> to make. The President
                        suggested that these two reports be put together.</p>
                    <p>At this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> once
                        again inquired about the fate of his proposal that we offer the Czechs a
                        large amount of our surplus agricultural commodities. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> replied that this suggestion
                        had not been ignored, but had been considered by the Operations Coordinating
                        Board at a recent meeting. At the time of this consideration the Attorney
                        General had provided an opinion that it would be contrary to the provisions
                        of Public Law 480 for the United States to dispose of agricultural surpluses
                        behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
                    <p>The President then adverted to the fact that many of the restrictive laws on
                        trade with the Soviet bloc countries had been passed when the country was in
                        a state of hysteria and when the McCarthy problem was at its height. Now
                        that this hysteria had lessened, the President wondered if it would not be
                        sensible to take a fresh look at the wisdom of this restrictive legislation.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he would
                        confine himself to pointing out that it was “ridiculous” for the United
                        States to have a vast pile of economic ammunition, in the shape of surplus
                        food and agricultural products, which we could use against the Soviets but
                        which in fact all we are doing is sitting on. The President expressed
                        emphatic agreement with this observation, and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to point out that the
                        Soviets raise hell with us by their purchase of surpluses from the
                        underdeveloped countries. Why could we not raise hell with the Soviets by
                        offering to dispose of some of our surpluses within the Soviet bloc?</p>
                    <p>The President then referred once again to his favorite project of making West
                        Berlin a showcase by sending to it a lot of our surplus <pb n="334"
                            xml:id="pg_334" facs="0366"/>food, so that the West Berliners would be
                        the sleekest and best-fed people in Europe. The President recalled that
                        somewhere or other he had had a report on this subject, and the report had
                        said that the West Berliners were already very adequately fed.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> speculated as to whether
                        the time had not come to revive one of the President’s favorite ideas,
                        namely, that the United States should get itself in the position of being
                        able to barter its agricultural surpluses behind the Iron Curtain in return
                        for strategic materials. At the moment, of course, we were completely
                        blocked from this course of action by the provisions in Public Law 480.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> was inclined to doubt
                        whether the Soviets would barter strategic materials in return for our
                        surplus agricultural products. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName> warned that if we thus developed trade with the
                        Soviet bloc nations, our allies could well ask us why we were attempting to
                        keep down their own trade with the Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>The President said that in any case he was convinced that the Administration
                        had been much too concerned with what Congress thought about the problem of
                        trade with the Soviet bloc. After all, Congress was primarily moved by
                        political considerations. There was need, therefore, for a new look at the
                        problem of East-West trade generally.</p>
                    <p>The Executive Secretary suggested that the President might wish to ask the
                        Operations Coordinating Board for a report as to existing legal authority
                        for the United States to trade with Iron Curtain countries and to dispose of
                        agricultural surpluses in these countries. The President replied that he
                        wanted this subject dealt with in the reports from Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> scheduled now for the Council meeting on April 19. He
                        wanted all of this put together in one package, together with charts and
                        maps.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed the wish
                        that the Attorney General review his opinion (referred to earlier) as to the
                        legal authority of the United States to sell or trade its surpluses behind
                        the Iron Curtain.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Minister Shima was requested to come to the Department for the purpose of
                        discussing the feasibility of reopening the conversations dealing with
                        Japan’s several requests for reductions in the Communist China trade control
                        program. It had been planned to have a discussion with Minister Shima and
                        his two experts who have recently arrived in Washington from Tokyo during
                        the afternoon of April 10.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> explained that we would be
                        unable to have the afternoon meeting since the Congressional presentation on
                        the 1957 Mutual Security Program had been moved forward to Wednesday, April
                        11, thus necessitating preparations for an earlier presentation than had
                        been anticipated. He assured Minister Shima that the inability to meet as
                        scheduled in no way indicated a diminution in the United States Government’s
                        interest in obtaining a full understanding of the Japanese desires in
                        connection with the trade control <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0368"
                        />program. He expressed full appreciation of the cooperation and good faith
                        which Japan had demonstrated during the recent weeks when conversations
                        between the Department and the Japanese Embassy had been held. He
                        specifically referred to Japan’s moderation in request for exceptions. He
                        explained that the views which have been expressed to date by Minister Shima
                        have been forwarded to the highest levels inside the United States
                        Government and that these views, including the specific information about
                        individual items, had been of benefit to the United States Government in the
                        review of the items on the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>
                        differential which was initiated following the visit of Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> noted that the Japanese had
                        depended exclusively upon commercial criteria in placing the various items
                        on their list in order of priority. The U.S. review, however, must of
                        necessity place priority interest upon strategic considerations. It had been
                        thought that the review would have progressed to a point by now where
                        further discussion with the Japanese on the items which they suggested for
                        deletion would have been possible. However, with the new economic drive of
                        the Communists in Asia there has developed some thinking inside the U.S.
                        Government that relaxation at this time would constitute help to the
                        Communists in keeping their promises for developmental assistance. In
                        addition, there has been a very strong reaction in the United States to the
                        1954 <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> reduction. The increase in
                        copper shipments following that relaxation has caused alarm on the part of
                        many people both in the Executive and Legislative branches of the
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>These developments have precluded the finalization of the U.S. Government
                        review at the present time. Our inability to discuss the matter in terms of
                        specific commodities does not indicate any decline in our interest, and we
                        would like to work the matter out with the Japanese. In this connection it
                        would be most helpful to the U.S. Government if it were possible for the
                        Japanese to indicate a minimum position on which they would be willing to
                        support the U.S. in our objectives at the GC meeting.</p>
                    <p>Minister Shima was informed that throughout the entire U.S. Government there
                        is understanding and appreciation of the position which the Japanese
                        Government has been taking.</p>
                    <p>Minister Shima stated that he understood the position in which the U.S.
                        Government finds itself at the present time on this subject and furthermore,
                        he is certain that the Japanese Government appreciates the interest of the
                        U.S. in trying to reach a settlement of the problem.</p>
                    <p>However, he doubted the validity of the argument that <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> reductions would assist the
                        Communists in their new drive into Asian countries. He thought that a
                        reduction in the trade <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0369"/>controls
                        could be connected with the new Communist economic drive only in a very
                        general way, namely, that increased trade could be beneficial in the
                        over-all economy of Communist China. However, he failed to see how the
                        delivery of some additional items could be helpful. Accordingly, he thought
                        that it would be necessary to consider individual items in connection with
                        this particular problem.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the question of additional copper shipments to the Soviet
                        bloc, he expressed a belief that the list review in 1954 should be viewed in
                        a different light from the reduction which the Japanese are currently
                        requesting. He asserted that the original <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> was established on strategic considerations. Consequently
                        by definition the removal of copper in 1954 involved the elimination of a
                        strategic item. However, he indicated that the Japanese are only requesting
                        the deletion of items which are not strategic in the current situation.
                        Consequently, the arguments which are currently circulating inside the U.S.
                        Government should not be applied to the Japanese proposed list for
                        deletion.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the possibility of Japan’s indicating a minimum position,
                        Minister Shima expressed the conviction that his Government would be unable
                        to present such a position. He explained that the fundamental position in
                        Japan is essentially the same as that of the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >U.K.</gloss>, namely, that the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> differential
                        should be eliminated. Consequently, if a <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>
                        review were to cover the entire <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> differential,
                        it would probably not be possible for Japan to abide by an agreement with
                        the U.S. on a minimum position which was below that which the other
                        participating countries were requesting. Also, he thought that the most
                        recent list submitted by the Japanese represents the Japanese Government’s
                        views of the situation. He explained that further delineation of priorities
                        by the Japanese Government would be difficult. The absence of trade in the
                        items makes it next to impossible to estimate how much trade would actually
                        develop in each of the items.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> expressed the hope that it
                        would be possible to discuss the individual items with Minister Shima within
                        a short period of time. At the present juncture it is not clear how soon
                        that can take place. However, he hoped that Japan could give us a clearer
                        indication of the items which are bothering them the most.</p>
                    <p>Minister Shima expressed his appreciation for our kindness and efforts in
                        connection with this problem. However, he stated that he is not sure that it
                        will be possible to produce results from these conversations. He stated that
                        they have two experts from the Foreign Office in Tokyo in Washington at the
                        present time and expressed the opinion that it would be helpful if these
                        experts could have the opportunity of discussion with U.S. experts. Such
                        discussions could lead to a better understanding on the part of the <pb
                            n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0370"/>Japanese experts of the U.S.
                        position on individual items. Further information of this type would be most
                        helpful to the experts, both of whom are representatives of the Foreign
                        Ministry, when they go back to Tokyo and help to administer the Japanese
                        Government’s side of the trade control program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> agreed that this type of
                        discussion might be beneficial and indicated that we would follow up to see
                        whether and when such meetings could be initiated.</p>

                    <p>[Here follows discussion of unrelated subjects.]</p>
                    <p>The President spoke at length on his ideas concerning trade. He felt that
                        people approach the matter too narrowly. It is a certainty that nations will
                        trade with each other. We should concentrate on copper and a half dozen
                        items of most advanced machinery and electronics and encourage trade in
                        everything else. There is a feeling that only the Communists would benefit
                        from trade. He is confident that the West has skill in trading such that a
                        net advantage would probably lie with them. He did see positive value in
                        pressing forward with trade with the Satellites in Eastern Europe. Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that we are down to
                        a very few items in terms of trade with the Satellites. We should try,
                        however, to avoid giving them advanced items, thus letting them save the
                        developmental costs which are frequently quite great. The President
                        commented on how he understood Mr. <persName>Baruch</persName> has
                        completely changed his view as to trade—two years ago he thought we should
                        be very restrictive; today he would make trade completely free. Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> commented on how the
                        Communists use their trade delegations to “bore in”—also, how they use their
                        trade as a weapon for other objectives. The President said that if it were
                        possible to get agreement between State, Commerce, Defense, and <gloss
                            target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> as to what trade means to the world, it
                        might then be possible to get through a national program in spite of the
                        tendencies to demagoguery on this matter and the <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339"
                            facs="0371"/>pressures for restriction arising out of our high prices
                        and high wage rates.<note n="2" xml:id="d108fn2">In a telephone conversation
                            on April 19, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> discussed
                            East-West trade: “President said he was very worried about the whole
                            thing, felt that we had been sticking our heads in the sand. Talking
                            about committee, President said that they had been too long influenced
                            by the McCarthy line—going to have a hard time (with foreign trade
                            bill). President said that what they were trying to do was to dam up the
                            trade currents in the world and they won’t be dammed up. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said he was impressed with
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>’s arguments, but
                            President said after all <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
                            was a military expert and that this was in another field. <persName

                                >Humphrey</persName> said it was ‘seeking to lock the barn door

                    </list>
                    <p>In the course of a call on the Secretary about other subjects, the Secretary
                        said to Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSR1">Roger Makins</persName> that he
                        wished to discuss briefly the problem relating to the <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">Chincom</gloss> lists. He said that in the US we
                        were in a very bad bind over this, and he knew the strength of the feeling
                        in Britain with respect to review of the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >Chincom</gloss> lists. The Secretary said the British had been very
                        patient. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had first
                        brought this subject up at Geneva last autumn, and since then it had been
                        discussed during the <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>–<persName
                            corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> visit. The US had been rather
                        remiss in handling this matter expeditiously. However, this entire question
                        was charged with dynamite insofar as Congress was concerned. The Secretary
                        said Congressional leaders had warned him in the most solemn way that if we
                        tinkered with the China trade controls it would jeopardize the passage of
                        the entire Mutual Security legislation this year. While some members of
                        Congress had honest and strong feelings about the maintenance of all
                        controls on China trade, some others were probably using the issue of
                        controls on China trade as a pretext to attack the Mutual Security Program
                        developed by the Administration.</p>
                    <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0372"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said he did not quite know how to deal with this matter. If we
                        could drag it out and not deal with it until the Congress recessed, it would
                        be extremely helpful. He did not know, however, whether this would be
                        feasible insofar as the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was concerned in
                        view of the heavy pressures there. Another possibility was an informal
                        loosening up of some of the control items and a tightening up of one or two
                        others such as copper wire. The Secretary said he hoped Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_MSR1">Makins</persName> would discuss this matter fully at
                        London, explaining the domestic implications and the effect on our foreign
                        aid program. He mentioned that last evening Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_KW1">Knowland</persName>, and the evening before Congressman
                            <persName corresp="#p_VJM1">Vorys</persName>, had both emphasized
                        privately to him that any serious tinkering with the China trade controls
                        would jeopardize the passage of the Mutual Security legislation.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the Mutual Security legislation, even without the China trade
                        control element, we were in for rough sledding. The Secretary felt we would
                        get support from the House Foreign Affairs Committee and from the Senate
                        Foreign Relations Committee, but it would run into rough sledding in the
                        Appropriations Committee. Therefore, the Secretary suggested that “we put
                        our heads together to see if we cannot come up with a way to handle this
                        problem, which is of the utmost gravity”.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSR1">Makins</persName> said the trouble was
                        that we had announced at the conclusion of the <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                            >Eden</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> talks
                        that a review would be made of the China trade control items. Thus far,
                        nothing had happened, and tremendous pressures had built up in the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. The Secretary agreed, and as he had
                        mentioned earlier, we had been remiss in moving so slowly on it, but he
                        wished Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSR1">Roger</persName> to know that there
                        was a problem with the Congress and also serious problems within the
                        government as to what we should do. The Department of Defense opposed in
                        almost an emotional way any relaxation of any of the trade controls, and had
                        made known its opposition to members of Congress. Frequently their
                        opposition was pitched on a highly emotional appeal relating back to the
                        Americans who had died in the Korean war and the fact that we were giving
                        strategic materials to the Chinese Communists, which, if hostilities
                        occurred, would kill more American boys, etc.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSR1">Makins</persName> said he had two
                        personal suggestions to make. In the first place, couldn’t something be done
                        about rubber? He said the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had asked for a
                        review of the China controls and that this had been agreed at the <persName
                            corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> meeting. If we could only quickly say that the
                        review was in process and that something had been done about rubber, the
                        heat could be greatly taken off the British Government. The Secretary said
                        this was an interesting idea. If we could announce something about rubber,
                        could the British do something about putting quantitative limitations back
                        on the shipment of copper wire?</p>
                    <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0373"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSR1">Makins</persName> said that we had not
                        formally and officially yet asked the British to review the copper wire
                        situation, and suggested that we ask them to do so. He knew there were heavy
                        pressures in Britain not to limit the sale of copper wire, but he was not
                        certain that something could not be done. He then reverted to the question
                        of rubber and said an absurd situation existed where Ceylon sold rubber and
                        Malaya did not, and it was creating problems … .</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he had been reflecting on this matter, and although he had
                        not spoken to other elements within the US Government, he now felt that
                        instead of handling the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> review in
                        the glare of the spotlight with high level negotiators, it was of the utmost
                        importance to handle it very quietly. He said he felt there were
                        possibilities of our doing something about rubber, and he hoped the British
                        could do something about copper wire, since this was a very important item
                        that everybody, including the Congress in this country, knew about, and they
                        also knew that this copper wire was necessary for Soviet development and
                        expansion in their atomic and guided missile capabilities… .</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSR1">Roger</persName> said that if the only result
                        of a review was to put copper wire back on the list, it was a hopeless
                        exercise, as the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would never agree to
                        this. If, on the other hand, the US would take some controls off rubber or
                        some other items, something might be done about copper wire. He agreed that
                        this problem should be dealt with quietly and not in the glare of the
                        spotlight, and he would talk about the problem with his Government
                        immediately following his return to London.</p>
                    <p>There was some brief discussion about the desirability of avoiding publicity.
                        Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSR1">Roger</persName> said that if some items
                        were decontrolled, there would have to be public announcement in the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> so that shippers and exporters would know.
                        The Secretary commented again that the less publicity given to all this, the
                        better, although he understood that shippers and exporters would have to
                            know.<note n="2" xml:id="d109fn2"><p>On April 18, <persName

                                understand your problems, but I too am disturbed at the situation at
                                this end and I am wondering if it will soon be possible for you to

                                    >CHINCOM</gloss> list in October 1955. We discussed this matter
                                during <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s visit in
                                January 1956. At this meeting we agreed to review individual items,

                                from the time of their first approach to us.</item>

                            <item>The Secretary outlined the hearings currently being held by the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName> Committee, and
                                the difficulties being placed in the way of the passage of the
                                Mutual Security Act. He specifically referred to the danger of
                                possible restrictive amendments which would prohibit aid to
                                countries trading with the communist bloc. I pointed out that many
                                of our difficulties stemmed from Defense Department witnesses who
                                opposed almost any trade with the bloc and the desire of certain
                                committee members to engage in partisan politics. It seemed
                                inadvisable to engage in a formal high-level negotiation looking
                                toward a lowering of controls on strategic items under these
                                circumstances.</item>

                                    views were expressed and none of those present appeared willing
                                    to accept the responsibility for making a decision. The
                                    following points arose during the meeting: <list>

                                            that some leading countries were giving formal notice of
                                            “exceptions”, such as trucks and steel, followed by
                                            shipments of the items.</item>

                            <item>The Secretary proposed to the President that he would write a

                                outlining the dangers of the legislative situation and some of the
                                substantive points included in (3) above. The President
                                agreed.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>The President stated that many of the nations in the free world had to trade
                        with the bloc if they were to survive economically, and that the items on
                        the strategic list should be held to an absolute minimum. He agreed,
                        however, that we should make every effort to persuade the <gloss

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName></hi>:
                        I have this morning received your message about trade controls, with its
                        note of urgency. I have been working actively on the matter all day and give
                        you herewith the best conclusions I can now arrive at.</p>
                    <p>This is a very difficult problem and it is full of serious implications. The
                        Senate Committee, headed by Senater <persName corresp="#p_MCHC1"
                            >McClellan</persName>, has taken a very active and aggressive interest
                        in this matter. There are, I fear, political overtones and appreciable
                        danger that a Congress which finds foreign aid particularly distasteful this
                        election year might try to find in this a reason either for truncating the
                        entire program or for attaching conditions which would seek to penalize
                        heavily any trade with the Soviet or Chinese Communist bloc in whatever
                        Congress might define as strategic goods. I can assure you that this danger
                        is not imaginary.</p>
                    <p>I feel today that under all the circumstances the best we could contemplate
                        would be a package which would (a) put copper wire back on the <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> list and tighten up somewhat the entire
                            <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0376"/>control system and (b) take
                        rubber and a number of miscellaneous items, perhaps 30 or 40, off the <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> list.</p>
                    <p>The Defense Department and Chiefs of Staff feel most strongly about the
                        copper matter and I really wish that, quite apart from anything else, you
                        would review this situation not as a matter of bargaining between us but as
                        part of our common endeavor to retard the development of the Soviet military
                        establishment, particularly in terms of modern weapons and means of
                        communication—all of which requires copper and, above all, copper wire.</p>
                    <p>I feel confident that none of us would have wanted to take copper wire off
                        the list had we foreseen the obviously great need therefor of the Soviet
                        Union for its military purposes, as demonstrated by its very heavy
                        purchases.</p>
                    <p>Please let me know whether you would want to try to work along the above
                        lines. If so, we will try to respond, although it is extremely awkward for
                        us to be dealing with this matter at the same time on two fronts, one the
                        Congressional front and the other the international front with our
                        associates in London and Paris.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary handed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJE1">Coulson</persName> a
                        letter replying to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selywn Lloyd</persName>’s
                        recent communication on the subject of the China trade controls. After
                        reading the letter Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJE1">Coulson</persName>
                        thanked the Secretary and said he was very glad to note that a concrete
                        proposal had now been made.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he was sorry that we had not been able to communicate
                        our views on this subject to the British before this, <pb n="345"
                            xml:id="pg_345" facs="0377"/>but as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJE1"
                            >Coulson</persName> was aware, this whole question is receiving a lot of
                        attention and there is a great deal of opposition to any relaxation of
                        controls. He referred particularly to the activities of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName> Committee and said that there
                        are some members of Congress who would be glad to seize upon any suggestion
                        of a relaxation of controls as an excuse to reduce or eliminate our foreign
                        aid program.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he had worked very hard on this reply with many
                        members of the Cabinet and that he had discussed their final decision, as
                        embodied in the letter to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selywn
                        Lloyd</persName>, with the President. The Secretary said that the final
                        paragraph of the letter might appear to be phrased in a rather tentative way
                        but, he explained, he had not had an opportunity to discuss the question
                        with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> is to appear tomorrow morning
                        before the <persName corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName> Committee on
                        the subject of East-West trade. The tentative nature of the final paragraph
                        of the letter was due to his desire not to embarrass Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> in any way. He could assure Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE1">Coulson</persName>, however, that it is our
                        firm intention to go through with this proposal if the British Government so
                        desires.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJE1">Coulson</persName> said he assumed that the
                        proposal would have to be discussed eventually on a multilateral basis. The
                        Secretary agreed but asked that the British Government hold it very closely
                        and take every precaution to prevent any “leaks” until we have had an
                        opportunity to discuss it again on a bilateral basis. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE1">Coulson</persName> said he would emphasize this point
                        in communicating the proposal to his Foreign Office.</p>

                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Joseph Dodge</persName>, as Chairman of the
                        Council on Foreign Economic Policy, to coordinate Council consideration of
                        the <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0378"/>next three items on the agenda.
                        Accordingly, Mr. <persName>Dodge</persName> rose and asked Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> to present the first report.
                        (A copy of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>’ report is
                        filed in the Minutes of the meeting.)<note n="3" xml:id="d113fn3">Not

                    <p>In his presentation Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                        referred first to a chart entitled “Divisions of World Trade” (in billions
                        of dollars). This was divided into trade of the free world, East-West trade,
                        and intra-bloc trade, and the levels of trade in each of these categories
                        compared between the years 1948 and 1955. Apart from the great growth of
                        trade within the free world from 1948 to 1955, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that the major change
                        was the considerable increase in intra-bloc trade.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> then turned to a second
                        chart, entitled “Bloc Imports” (in billions of dollars). This chart also
                        gave the major categories of items imported by the Soviet bloc. Soviet bloc
                        imports from the free world had been just under $2 billion in value in 1948.
                        In 1955 these imports were just over $2 billion in value. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> indicated that after controls on
                        free world exports to the Soviet bloc had first been imposed in 1948,
                        European trade with the bloc had increased slightly, while the trade of the
                        United States and Canada with the bloc had dropped abruptly and remained
                        low. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> also pointed out the
                        greatly increased importation of food products into the Soviet bloc, which
                        since 1954 had become a net importer of food products. The Soviet bloc was
                        likewise still a net importer of manufactured products, though it was now
                        engaged in exporting a considerable number of items of manufactured goods.
                        Likewise, the cost of manufactured goods exported by the Soviet bloc was
                        declining.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> next turned to a chart
                        which described “Bloc Exports”. This indicated that the bloc had exported to
                        the value of just over $2 billion in 1948. This figure had risen to
                        $2,367,000,000 in 1955, with Western Europe again the dominant market.</p>
                    <p>After a brief description of the system of controls on East-West trade, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> drew the conclusion that
                        the current controls on trade between the West and the Soviet bloc did not
                        impose any serious deterrent to the industrial growth or military
                        capabilities of the Soviet bloc. On the other hand, these controls were
                        effective in reference to certain specific items where they acted as a
                        qualitative deterrent. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                        then described the various means by which the Soviet bloc circumvented these
                        controls, with particular reference to copper, shipping, and rubber. He
                        noted that the Soviet Union had imported 100,000 tons of copper in 1955.
                        This was chiefly in the form of copper wire, because this commodity was not
                        decontrolled. Copper wire had thus replaced raw copper, which was the chief
                        form of Soviet bloc imports of copper prior to the decontrol of <pb n="347"
                            xml:id="pg_347" facs="0379"/>copper wire. Soviet bloc imports of copper
                        in 1953 and 1954 amounted to approximately 120,000 tons.</p>
                    <p>These figures occasioned questions and discussion by Secretaries <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> expressed regret
                        that the West had permitted the Soviet bloc to get so much copper at a time
                        when to have withheld this commodity would have hurt the Soviet bloc. Under
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> also pointed out
                        that more effective transshipment controls had helped to reduce the import
                        of raw copper into the Soviet Union in the course of 1955.</p>
                    <p>With respect to shipping, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                        went on to point out that the Soviet bloc sought in particular high-speed
                        freighters and tankers, both of which were under strict control. As a
                        result, they have had to use domestic shipyards in order to construct such
                        vessels. While this had no apparent effect on the Soviet bloc production of
                        naval vessels, it had certainly delayed modernization of the Soviet bloc
                        commercial fleet.</p>
                    <p>As to free world controls on trade with Communist China, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> expressed the view that, by and
                        large, such controls had been more effective than controls imposed on the
                        European members of the bloc. If all controls were dropped, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> estimated that trade between the
                        West and Communist China would be increased annually by the sum of
                        approximately $125 million.</p>
                    <p>Thereafter, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> adverted
                        briefly to the problem of rice, particularly in relation to Burma, and
                        closed his formal report with a statement as to future bloc prospects for
                        East-West trade. In this latter context, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                            >Dulles</persName> estimated that East-West trade could be doubled in
                        the next five years. He agreed, however, with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> that even if the present levels of
                        East-West trade doubled by 1960, such trade would amount to only 4% of total
                        world trade.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> reminded the Council of its
                        recent actions on the reference subject, and then proceeded to brief the
                        Council on the contents of the report to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> by the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> on
                        multilateral export controls on trade with Communist China (enclosure to the
                        reference memorandum by the Executive Secretary dated April 9, 1956). He
                        read the majority views as to the U.S. position in forthcoming negotiations
                        with respect to the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">ChinCom</gloss> list. He
                        also read the negotiating objectives and negotiating procedures, on which
                        subjects all departments and agencies were in agreement. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> then read the language proposed by
                        the Departments of Defense and the Treasury as a substitute for paragraph
                        3–a, which was endorsed by all the other departments and agencies. The
                        fundamental difference between the position taken by the Defense and
                        Treasury Departments, as opposed to the majority position, derived from the
                        fact that all the concessions which Defense and Treasury were willing to
                        make in decontrolling items for shipment to Communist China, came from List
                        A in Annex D of the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> report. List A
                        consisted of items judged to have the least strategic and economic
                        significance for Communist China. Finally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName> pointed out that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had
                        endorsed the stricter and shorter list proposed by Defense and Treasury.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of these introductory remarks and explanation by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName>, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> expressed surprise that the Department
                        of Commerce was included in the majority position. He had believed that
                        Commerce had sided in this matter with Defense and Treasury. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> added that this also was
                        his understanding <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0381"/>of the position
                        of the Department of Commerce. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName> replied that while initially in the <gloss
                            target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> the Department of Commerce had aligned
                        itself with the Departments of Defense and the Treasury, the Commerce
                        representatives had ultimately reversed their position and aligned
                        themselves with the majority view.</p>
                    <p>In concluding his remarks Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName>
                        called attention to the existence of various ancillary reports bearing on
                        the subject of East-West trade. Among these he singled out for mention a
                        study by the Department of Defense of recent British requests for U.S. …
                        technical information. The Defense Department believed that the British
                        requests for this information gave us a handle to use in our negotiations
                        with them on the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">ChinCom</gloss> list. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> also noted a study which
                        had been made of the number and character of exceptions which the <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">CoCom</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >ChinCom</gloss> countries had made, under which exceptions they had
                        shipped certain controlled items to the Soviet bloc, including Communist
                        China.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> had concluded his
                        reference to these and other studies of the problem of East-West trade
                        generally, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> reiterated
                        that the Department of Commerce was in favor of the shorter list proposed by
                        the Departments of Defense and the Treasury; he wished to make this point
                        clear and leave to a later time explanations of the misunderstanding of the
                        Commerce position.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> stated his desire to
                        summarize what was essential in the position taken by the Departments of
                        Defense and the Treasury in the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> paper.
                        Above all, what these two departments wanted was a firm agreement with our
                        allies to remove certain important items from the list of items which could
                        be traded with the Soviet bloc, before proceeding to add any items which
                        could be traded with the Soviet bloc. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> also expressed very great concern about the
                        extensive number of items on the exceptions list which had permitted our
                        allies to trade many items which were under control.</p>
                    <p>The President said he wished to put a question. If we put copper wire on the
                        embargoed list, which of our friends would we hurt and how much would we
                        hurt them? It was pointed out to the President that most of the copper which
                        was going to the Soviet bloc came from Africa, although it was largely
                        British-owned. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> commented
                        that the case for embargoing copper and copper wire was very strong, because
                        these commodities were in short supply in the Soviet Union and were
                        absolutely essential to all kinds of military production and also to the
                        large hydroelectric projects which were being carried out in the Soviet
                        Union and which were currently being offered by the Soviet Union to various
                        underdeveloped countries. The President said that of course he favored
                        prohibiting <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0382"/>trade with the Soviet
                        bloc in copper. Otherwise, however, he was strongly against too long and
                        large a list of embargoed and controlled items. The sensible thing was to
                        concentrate on controlling a group of truly significant items and to secure
                        from our allies a commitment for the strict enforcement of controls on these
                        items. If we could obtain these objectives we could say “to hell with the
                        rest of it.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> expressed strong
                        skepticism as to the value of an embargo on the shipment to the Soviet bloc
                        of combination boring, milling and drilling machines with spindle sizes of
                        six inches and larger in diameter. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> believed the Soviets could make such machines any
                        time they wanted to.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> stated that it
                        seemed a matter of great significance to him that the exceptions on the
                            <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">ChinCom</gloss> list were better than
                        two-thirds of the list itself, and that exceptions on the <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">CoCom</gloss> list amounted to 80% of this list.</p>
                    <p>The President repeated that he had very definite feelings on this problem. If
                        we try to maintain too strict a list of controlled and embargoed items, the
                        dam of trade would burst and the whole system of multilateral controls on
                        trade with the Soviet bloc would be carried away in the flood. Accordingly,
                        it was much more sensible to bear down on a few vital products of which we
                        wished to deprive the Soviet bloc. He certainly agreed with Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> on the futility of
                        embargoing these boring machines. We should get down to what needs to be
                        done, get our friends to stand firmly with us on these few items, and let
                        the rest be decontrolled.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> expressed the feeling that
                        the long list of exceptions showed indication of the impending
                        disintegration of the multilateral controls system, particularly as it
                        related to controls on trade with Communist China. In response to this
                        statement, the President expressed great sympathy for the plight of Japan,
                        which he felt was either obliged to trade with Communist China or “pass a
                        tin cup around in San Francisco.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName> discussed this matter briefly, and expressed the
                        opinion that the removal of controls on trade between Japan and Communist
                        China would by no means provide a complete answer to Japan’s trade and
                        economic problems. The President expressed agreement to the extent of
                        stating that Japan’s problems had to be settled in bites, and not all at
                        once.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> felt that there were
                        two points which needed emphasis on trade between Japan and China. China had
                        obvious need of certain manufactured articles produced in Japan. Japan in
                        turn needed certain raw materials from China. Perhaps the two countries
                        could get together and work it out; but from a psychological point of view,
                        as long as the Japanese feel that the United States has them under wraps,
                        they won’t like it. Perhaps the best thing was <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351"
                            facs="0383"/>for us to allow the Japanese to make the effort to increase
                        their trade with Communist China and see for themselves that this was not
                        the real answer to all their problems.</p>
                    <p>At this point the Secretary of State turned to Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> and asked him whether he was aware
                        that some of our U.S. banks were apparently extending credits to certain
                        banks in Western Europe, which were in turn extending credits to banks
                        within the Soviet bloc. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> replied that he was at the moment investigating
                        these allegations; indeed, the Attorney General had spoken of it to him only
                        yesterday. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> went on
                        to state once again the essence of the Treasury position. It was simply a
                        matter of bringing pressure and finding means by which we could exclude
                        certain vital items from going to the Soviet bloc and to secure effective
                        control of these particular items in exchange for a general reduction of
                        other items on the present control lists.</p>
                    <p>With considerable vehemence, the President expressed his firm opposition to
                        bringing pressure on the British by withholding from them … technical
                        information if they refused to agree to our views on the <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">ChinCom</gloss> list. He said he remembered vividly
                        our dependence in the early stages of the last war on British intelligence,
                        and the generosity with which this intelligence was made available to the
                        United States. He would have nothing to do with what, in practice, amounted
                        to blackmailing Great Britain. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> expressed himself as in complete agreement with the
                        President’s position on this point.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> said that there was one
                        other matter of importance to bring to the Council’s attention. In view of
                        what had happened in recent days at the hearings of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName> Committee and the difficulties
                        which Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName>, <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> and others had encountered, the
                        question of timing of any Council action to reduce the items on the <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">ChinCom</gloss> list was of extreme importance.
                        Both State and the International Cooperation Administration were concerned
                        about the possible adverse impact on the current mutual security program in
                        Congress if the Council moved too fast or too fully in the matter of the
                            <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">ChinCom</gloss> controls.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed agreement as to the reality of this danger, but
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that he
                        would be seeing <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> next
                            Wednesday<note n="13" xml:id="d113fn13"><persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> was scheduled to arrive in Paris on Wednesday,
                            May 2, for a meeting of the North Atlantic Council.</note> and would
                        certainly like to be in a position to talk with the Foreign Secretary on the
                        matter of the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">ChinCom</gloss> levels. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> added that in any case he
                        felt that certain members of Congress should know what the Council was
                        proposing to do about this problem before we actually begin to do <pb
                            n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0384"/>it. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> expressed very strong agreement with
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName>’s latter point. The Vice
                        President said that we need not anticipate any great difficulty with the
                        Foreign Affairs Committee or the Foreign Relations Committee. On the other
                        hand, in the case of the <persName corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName>
                        Committee and Senator Symington, we would find ourselves up against a
                        strictly political maneuver. A big pitch would be made by the Democrats.
                        They would cause much more trouble than the right-wing Republicans. No one
                        need be too worried about McCarthy.</p>
                    <p>The President repeated his suggestion that a presentation of the problem to
                        the two Foreign Affairs Committees would be a good way to get things started
                        in Congress. The Vice President agreed that this would be helpful if it
                        proved possible to do it. On the other hand, he did have a distaste for
                        telling <persName corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName> and Symington what
                        we proposed to do in our forthcoming negotiations with the British.</p>
                    <p>At this point the President turned to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> and asked for his views as to what was the desirable
                        action for the Council to take on this problem. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied by stating his feeling that
                        if we could indicate to the British and to our other allies that we are
                        prepared to agree to their continuing to make exceptions with respect to the
                            <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">ChinCom</gloss> list, such exceptions to be
                        confined to the items in Lists A and B in Annex D, such a procedure would be
                        much more satisfactory than formal negotiations with our allies with the
                        object of amending the actual <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">CoCom</gloss> list.
                        In other words, if we could operate on the basis of an informal
                        understanding that this Government would not object to continued exceptions
                        within the limits of Lists A and B, this method of operating would be
                        preferable to formalizing changes in the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >ChinCom</gloss> list, particularly from the point of view of public
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>Both Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> expressed great concern over the
                        proposal for Council action made by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>. They predicted that if this Government followed such
                        a course of action the result would soon be the complete wreck of the
                        multilateral controls system on trade with the Soviet bloc and Communist
                        China. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> added that Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ proposal also provided no
                        answer to the problem of copper. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> replied that we would certainly never be able to get
                        copper back on the embargoed list unless we were prepared to be pretty
                        liberal with respect to other items that our allies desired to
                        decontrol.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested that the United States itself was in a very good
                        position to do something about preventing the Turkish output of borax from
                        finding its way to the Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General then inquired whether, in the course of the forthcoming
                            <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">CoCom</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >ChinCom</gloss> negotiations, the United <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353"
                            facs="0385"/>States could work it out in such a way that when final
                        agreement was reached on the list of items subject to control, this list
                        could be made public. The Congress was very anxious to have this list, and
                        it seemed to the Attorney General that the Congress should have it.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> replied by pointing
                        out that all information on the actual items in East-West trade had long
                        since been made public. The only things which were still kept on a
                        confidential basis and supplied to the Congress on this basis, were the
                        technical descriptions of items which comprised the strategic list. The
                        items of this list, he believed, could not be made public without severe
                        repercussions from our allies. The Attorney General nevertheless contended
                        that the Executive Branch was in an unfortunate position from a public
                        relations point of view because it had withheld this list. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, however, contended, as
                        had Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>, that all
                        products which were actually traded between the West and the Soviet bloc
                        were in the public domain. The only information we withheld from the public
                        were the items that are not traded. In this difference of opinion Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> expressed his sympathy for
                        the viewpoint of the Attorney General, while Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> expressed his agreement with the
                        position of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>. The
                        President commented that whatever we did we could not jeopardize the
                        multilateral controls system. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> added the warning that we might very well have a
                        break with our allies if we decided to publish the items on the control and
                        embargo list, or if we otherwise persisted in looking at the problems of
                        East-West trade from the narrow point of view of exclusive U.S. interests
                        rather than from the point of view of the free world as a whole.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>, noting our very
                        great anxiety to get copper back onto the embargoed list, urged that we
                        bring heavy pressure on Great Britain to accomplish this objective.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> forcefully warned
                        that too much pressure on the British could well result in the breakdown of
                        the Anglo-American alliance. Was Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> seeking this objective?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> stated his opinion
                        that if we failed to convince the British and our other allies on the
                        rational necessity of embargoing copper wire, the next logical position to
                        which the United States should retreat was a position that we would embargo
                        actual munitions to the Soviet bloc and let the controls on everything else
                        go by the board. If we did this, we would at least get credit throughout the
                        world for supporting the doctrine of free trade.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that in effect
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> was suggesting that
                        we use all the remainder of the control and embargo list as a bargaining
                        point for securing a complete and effective embargo on sales of copper and
                        copper wire to the Soviet bloc. Secretary <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354"
                            facs="0386"/><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> believed that
                        if we agreed to giving up controls on everything else, we could certainly
                        get copper wire back on the embargo list.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> observed that if one
                        stopped and thought of all that we had done for the British, one would
                        suppose that they would be willing to agree to embargo shipments of copper
                        to the Soviet bloc. After all, the volume of British trade in this commodity
                        was not in itself so great as to be very important. Moreover, besides the …
                        technical information which the British were seeking from us, there was a
                        lot else that the British needed from us and which we could withhold if they
                        proved stubborn. In response to this proposal, the President observed that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> seemed to be
                        suggesting that we give up our alliance with Great Britain. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> turned to Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> and asked with
                        considerable heat whether the Department of Defense was currently doing
                        anything for Great Britain which it did not deem desirable on its own merits
                        from the point of view of U.S. national interest. If the Defense Department
                        was doing such things, they had better quit doing them. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> disclaimed any desire whatever to
                        impair the Anglo-American alliance, but repeated his contention that if the
                        British could not be brought to agree to a rational solution of the copper
                        problem, he advocated a complete change in the basis of our trade policy
                        vis-à-vis the Soviet bloc—namely, continuing to embargo munitions to the
                        Soviet bloc, but otherwise free trade.</p>
                    <p>The President stated his belief that whatever we are doing about this problem
                        we are certainly doing from the point of view of enlightened self-interest.
                        He expressed, furthermore, support for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>’ proposal that we not agree to formal negotiations
                        designed to reduce the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">ChinCom</gloss> list
                        levels, but instead continue to wink at the exceptions our allies make to
                        this list and determine if we cannot, as a result, induce them to agree to
                        embargo copper.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> emphasized again his
                        belief that such a de facto change in the level of trade with Communist
                        China, rather than a formal change in the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >ChinCom</gloss> lists, might prove highly advantageous and might enable
                        us to get copper on the list of embargoed items. For one thing, said
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, he did not wish the
                        Administration to be put in the position of appearing to be “going soft” on
                        Communist China. This charge might well be made against us if, by formal
                        Council action, we reduced the number of controlled items on trade between
                        the West and Communist China.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said that with respect to this general problem, and
                        particularly with respect to making the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >ChinCom</gloss> list public, he would give his advice for what it might
                        be worth. He said that he was well aware of the difficulties Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> had encountered with the
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName> Committee. On the
                        other hand, he had very little worry that the general public could be made
                        to <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0387"/>believe any charge that the
                        Executive Branch was “soft” on trade with Communist China. In short, he was
                        not much concerned over the politicking which would go on in the <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName> Committee. It was his advice
                        that the Council make the best possible decision on <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">ChinCom</gloss> controls based on strategic and
                        policy considerations, and leave domestic political considerations out of
                        the picture.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> again reemphasized
                        that the exceptions which our allies would be permitted to make would all be
                        confined to Lists A and B in Annex D of the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss> paper, and that such exceptions would be permitted only in
                        return for allied agreement to the embargo of copper wire. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> still expressed great
                        concern that the course of action suggested by Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> would result in the rapid
                        disappearance of all controls on trade between the West and the Soviet bloc.
                        The President stressed his view that what we wanted most of all was an
                        agreement for the embargoing of copper wire, plus a firm commitment by our
                        allies to maintain all other controls upon which they had agreed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> at this point expressed his
                        concurrence with the proposal made by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, provided the exceptions were confined to the A and B
                        lists, and provided the allies agreed in return to embargo copper wire. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> also suggested that along
                        with the items in Lists A and B there should be added the additional items
                        suggested for control by the Secretary of Commerce. In reply to this last
                        point, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he
                        would rather see the borax problem, for example, handled by the United
                        States in a unilateral way. If the United States produced 98% of the world
                        supply of borax it should be able to make a deal with the Turks with respect
                        to the remaining 2%.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> then said that as he
                        understood the consensus of the Council, the carrying out of Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ proposal would result in
                        no formal meeting of the Consultative Group, but would instead be explored
                        in informal negotiations with the British. At this point the Executive
                        Secretary, with the assistance of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName> and the President, summed up the consensus of the
                        meeting and indicated the probable shape of the Council action on this
                        item.</p>
                    <p>In closing the discussion, the President inquired of Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> whether it would be helpful if he
                        were to write to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName> in
                        support of the decision which had been reached at this meeting. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that he thought
                        such a letter would be useful, and that he would prepare a draft for the
                        President’s consideration.</p>

                        >Anthony</persName></hi>: We have had quite a few discussions here these
                        last days about the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> trade controls. <persName

                            >Selwyn Lloyd</persName> a few days ago and he will be talking further
                        with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">SELWYN</persName> at Paris next week. In the
                        meantime I want to let you know how much I hope that you can find it
                        possible to get copper wire back on the embargoed list. All the information
                        I get from our military, intelligence and economic people is that these
                        exports are seriously interfering with our common objectives in a number of
                        unfortunate ways. On the other hand, we are inclined to believe that it is
                        also consistent with our common objectives to acquiesce in liberal use of
                        the exception procedure for rubber and a number of other items on the <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> list as <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"

                    <p>I am sorry that we have been so slow about this matter but it is full of all

                    </list>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSR1">Roger</persName> said he had originally
                        expected to have some detailed instructions this morning to discuss with the
                        Secretary regarding strategic controls on shipments of items to Communist
                        countries. However, the recent message from the President had added a new
                        element to the situation, and Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LS1"
                            >Lloyd</persName> had informed Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSR1"
                            >Roger</persName> that in the light of the President’s message he would
                        look forward to discussing this subject with the Secretary in Paris.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSR1">Roger</persName> said he thought the general
                        approach taken by the President with respect to the <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">Chincom</gloss> controls was helpful. With respect
                        to copper wire shipments from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to the
                        Soviet Union, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was willing to review
                        this situation, but Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSR1">Roger</persName>
                        emphasized that it was not politically possible, in the light of the recent
                        Bulganin–Khrushchev visit and the heavy play the Soviets had made to
                        increase trade with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, for the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> as a result of such review simply to add
                        additional controls on the shipment of copper wire.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he understood the situation and the political difficulties
                        which the British Government would have if, when the Soviets were trying to
                        reduce the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">Cocom</gloss> list, the only result
                        were an increase in this list. He thought, however, that it might well be
                        possible to find two or three items on which the controls could be lowered.
                        The Secretary pointed out again the importance we attached to reducing the
                        shipments of copper wire for military … reasons, and Sir <persName
                            corresp="#p_MSR1">Roger</persName> said he had explained in detail our
                        views to <persName>Walter Monckton</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2"

                            >Peter Thorneycroft</persName> when he, Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSR1"

                    <p>It was left that the Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1"
                            >Lloyd</persName> would discuss this matter further in Paris when they

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Friend</hi>: Thank you for your letter of April 27
                        about trade controls. I must frankly tell you that your suggestion of adding
                        to the embargoed list presents most serious difficulties for us. I do not
                        see how we could agree to this now.</p>
                    <p>As to the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">Chincom</gloss> list, we greatly need
                        appreciable relaxation, particularly because of progress toward
                        self-government in our colonial territories. A country like Malaya simply
                        does not understand why it has to accept restrictions which are not in
                        operation in, for example, Ceylon.</p>
                    <p>But <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> will talk all this over with
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName> in Paris in the next few
                        days.</p>
                    <p>Kindest regards,</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> reported that he had held
                        several conversations with Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LS1"
                            >Lloyd</persName> that day, in which “we covered most of our problems.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> noted that he and
                            <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> talked about the trade
                        control problem, with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> repeating
                        what <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had told <persName
                            corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in January about the British
                        difficulty in placing copper wire on the prohibited list. “He did, however,”

                        they might put it on the quantitative list which would hold down the amounts

                        so that they would not be in the public posture of having met the

                        at home to study urgently whether something can be done along this line; and
                        if you could reinforce that note of urgency, I would appreciate it.” The
                        Secretary also mentioned that he and <persName corresp="#p_LS1"
                            >Lloyd</persName> discussed the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss> list “along the agreed lines,” and indicated that he
                        had made it clear “that our attitude on the Chinese list was part and parcel
                        of our position with reference to copper.” This letter was transmitted to

                        <head>TEXT OF MESSAGE FROM FOREIGN SECRETARY</head>
                        <p>My colleagues and I have carefully considered the proposals made by you
                            in Paris. We regret very much that they do not seem to be adequate to
                            meet our point of view. As you know, we wanted to take action on the
                            China List last October but have repeatedly deferred it out of regard
                            for your representations. We now think that the best course is for us to
                            rely upon an extended use of the exceptions procedure for permitting
                            reasonable exports of items on the China “differential”. We shall have
                            regard to the list put forward by you in Paris but we must also consider
                            the position in the Colonies and at home.</p>
                        <p>With regard to an embargo on copper wire, I am afraid that we are agreed
                            that that would be impossible for us in the light of the statement made
                            at the end of the visit of the Soviet leaders. In any case there seems
                            to be a substantial difference of opinion between us about the strategic
                            consequences and the relative importance of our copper wire exports. I
                            am preparing a considered statement on these aspects which I will send
                            to you as soon as possible.<note n="3" xml:id="d120fn3"><p>In telegram

                        <p>Her Majesty’s Government have given most careful consideration to the
                            view of the United States Government that special strategic importance
                            attaches to placing uncovered copper wire under embargo to the Soviet
                            bloc. For the reasons given below, however, they feel unable to share
                            the view of the United States Government on this question and they
                            accordingly regret that they cannot see their way to agreeing to such an
                            embargo.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>There is not, Her Majesty’s Government believe, any significant
                                difference between the United States and United Kingdom estimates of
                                the supplies of copper available to the Bloc. The United Kingdom
                                estimate that production within the Soviet Bloc in 1955 totalled
                                some 500,000 tons and imports some 100,000 tons, of which 80,000
                                tons consisted of bare wire licensed by the United Kingdom and other
                                Western countries.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>These figures admittedly show that the Bloc countries cannot meet
                                all their requirements from their own resources. But Her Majesty’s
                                Government have no grounds for thinking that the Bloc countries have
                                difficulty in meeting purely military requirements for copper,
                                whether in the form of wire or in other forms. Her Majesty’s
                                Government believe rather that these purely military requirements
                                    <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0398"/>are comparatively small
                                and that, even if all imports were cut off, they could easily be met
                                out of the Bloc’s indigenous resources and would in fact be met, to
                                the detriment, if necessary, of the civilian economy. Her Majesty’s
                                Government recognise that Western exports of uncovered wire may well
                                be giving assistance to the Soviet Bloc’s programme of
                                industrialisation and electrification. They would not, however,
                                regard the hampering of the general industrial development of the
                                Bloc as one of the objectives of the agreed strategic export
                                controls.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Her Majesty’s Government would recall that particular attention
                                was given to copper wire in the talks between the United States and
                                the United Kingdom defence experts which were held in London last
                                year, to consider what commodities should be embargoed in order to
                                hamper the Bloc countries in improving the security and efficiency
                                of their communications. It was then agreed that certain specialised
                                types of communications cable and associated equipment were worthy
                                of embargo, and joint proposals to this effect were in due course
                                accepted by the other Western countries. After careful study,
                                however, Her Majesty’s Government for their part came to the
                                conclusion at that time that there was no case for an embargo on
                                copper wire in this context, since only a small proportion of the
                                Bloc’s copper supplies was likely to be needed for communications.
                                After renewed consideration of the problem, they are bound to say
                                that they still adhere to the view that copper wire does not merit
                                embargo in this context either.</item>

                                    substantial differential of control over trade with Communist
                                    China; (b) the need to embargo copper wire; (c) the US desire to
                                    avoid a <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> meeting and the
                                    deletion of items from the China embargo list; and (d) the

                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> responded on May
                                    12 stating that the US proposals were not adequate to meet the
                                    British point of view; that, while having regard for the US
                                    List, they intended to rely upon an extended use of the
                                    exceptions procedure to permit reasonable exports of items on
                                    the China differential; and that they could not agree to an
                                    embargo on copper wire and would explain their views in a
                                    further statement. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has
                                    since informed us that while they will not press for a <gloss

                                    one if requested by another <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss>;
                                    further, they do not intend proposing to the United States that

                                The French have recently initiated conversations with other <gloss

                                Both Germany and Italy have requested our comments on lists for
                                deletion containing items not on the US list. Some of the <gloss

                                consulted the British but not them and believe that the United
                                States is deliberately attempting to conceal the results of our
                                review from them or to confront them with a US/<gloss

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I note with concern the recent
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> actions on multilateral controls on
                        trade with Communist China, the flagrant use of exceptions procedures, by
                        public announcement, and by contact with other governments which, in effect,
                        is undercutting the United States in the field of trade controls and is
                        seriously <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0404"/>weakening the United
                        States’ position in the Far East. I should further like to point out in
                        connection with this matter, the need for action prior to the June 26
                            meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d123fn2">Reference is to a meeting of the
                            China Committee scheduled for that date.</note> Should we fail to take
                        action, it is not unlikely that Congressional reaction might well jeopardize
                        our whole aid program.</p>
                    <p>Another matter of concern to me is the current <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >U.K.</gloss> plans and proposals with respect to their defense
                        commitments to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The point in
                        connection with this matter is the unilateral manner in which these
                        proposals are being considered.</p>
                    <p>My particular concern is more with the manner in which these actions are
                        being carried out without close coordination and cooperation with us. These
                        actions seem to indicate a decision on the part of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> to pull away from a close alliance with us
                        in these important and far-reaching matters. I feel that strong
                        representation should be made and that they should be informed that we may
                        be forced to make a critical reappraisal of the whole structure of our
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>Those of us in the Department of Defense who understand these facts feel that
                        either the above actions should be taken or the facts of the British
                        decision on trade controls should be given to the Congress before they
                        complete action on the aid bill.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I refer to your letter of June
                        22, 1956 (S–0720), regarding certain aspects of the question of China trade
                        controls, and other matters.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State and its missions in the field have been unremitting
                        in the effort to maintain an effective multilateral control over trade with
                        Communist China. The problem of maintaining such <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373"
                            facs="0405"/>a control is, as you are well aware, a difficult and
                        complex one, since it rests, and can only rest, on voluntary cooperative
                        action among the participating countries.</p>
                    <p>Our objective is to preserve the multilateral control structure with the most
                        significant level of control attainable. I am sure you appreciate that
                        attempts at coercion of our Allies in this matter would seriously risk the
                        collapse of the entire structure.</p>
                    <p>You mention in your letter the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>
                        announcement that it intends to make extended use of the exceptions
                        procedure. You will no doubt recall that for some two years the U.S.
                        Government has been made sharply aware of the increasing dissatisfaction of
                        most of the other participating countries with the China differential, and
                        that the question of modification was formally raised by the British
                        Government with the U.S. Government in November of last year and later by
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> with the
                        President during the talks in Washington in January of this year. The
                        British have inquired several times since then regarding progress on the
                        review of this question which the President directed be undertaken. The
                        British Government made it clear during the January talks that unless the
                        differential could be modified by multilateral action it would be forced to
                        some action on a national basis.</p>
                    <p>Any deterioration of the China trade controls is a matter of serious concern
                        to this Department. It must be recognized, however, that each nation remains
                        the final judge of its national interest, and retains freedom to act
                        accordingly. I need not point out that the U.S. Government has itself had to
                        act unilaterally on certain matters where we felt our interests to be
                        involved. We cannot reserve one standard for ourselves and apply another to
                        our Allies.</p>
                    <p>You have also mentioned in your letter the meeting of the China Committee
                        that was scheduled for June 26. This meeting did not take place.
                        Instructions were sent to our delegate to that Committee instructing him,
                        had the meeting taken place, to oppose any weakening of the controls through
                        the exceptions procedure.<note n="2" xml:id="d124fn2">Apparent reference to
                                <gloss target="#t_Topol1">Topol</gloss> 1629 to Paris, June 22, not
                            printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 493.419/6–2156)</note> The
                        U.S. delegate to the China Committee will continue to urge restraint upon
                        the other participating countries in the use of the exceptions
                        procedure.</p>
                    <p>As regards the general question of U.S. policy on China trade controls, this
                        policy is, as you know, now under review at a high level among the
                        interested Departments, including the Department of Defense. Involved in the
                        review is the question of further approaches to the participating countries
                        to reinforce the U.S. position <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0406"/>as
                        it has already been set forth in the China Committee. This Department favors
                        such approaches.</p>
                    <p>I have, of course, kept the appropriate Congressional Committees informed of
                        developments with respect to China trade controls, and I pointed out then
                        that the practical effect of the exceptions procedure could not yet be
                        gauged. In particular, it could not be concluded that the use of the
                        procedure would break down the multilateral control structure. In this
                        connection, we have just received word from the Embassy in London that the
                        British Foreign Minister has issued instructions that the use of the
                        exceptions procedure is to be controlled as tightly as possible.<note n="3"

                    <p>I also note that in your letter you have touched on the question of <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> defense planning, stating that the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> is acting unilaterally with respect to its
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense commitments. We have
                        recently been in touch with the British Government, reminding them of the
                        need for consultation by that Government with its <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> partners before any major changes are made in its forces.
                        The <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> again emphasized, in Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s statement to the House of
                        Commons on June 26, its intention to deal with <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> defense matters in concert with its Allies.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I think I need not stress the fact that the Anglo-American Alliance
                        is one of the key-stones of our own security and that of the entire free
                        world. I know of no actions or intention on the part of the British
                        Government which warrant the conclusion in your letter that there seems to
                        be a decision “on the part of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> to
                        pull away from a close alliance with us … ”.<note n="4" xml:id="d124fn4"
                            >Ellipsis in the source text.</note> From time to time there will
                        undoubtedly be differences on particular issues between the British and
                        ourselves. In deciding upon the U.S. course of action in such cases, we must
                        have regard to the overall U.S. national interest, and not merely to one
                        aspect thereof. The making of such judgments is, of course, the function of
                        this Department, under the direction of the President. It is clear to me
                        that any statement to the British along the lines you suggest in your
                        letter, that “we may be forced to make a critical appraisal of the whole
                        structure of our relations”, is not advisable in the circumstances to which
                        you refer.</p>

                            >CFEP</gloss> 501), the Steering Committee has reviewed the problem and
                        submits the following report.</p>
                    <p>1. The proposed policy revision of July 8, 1955 was not finalized because of
                        the possible bearing of the then forthcoming Geneva Four Power Foreign
                        Ministers’ meeting upon the policy paper. The Steering Group was, however,
                        continued on a standby basis and was utilized for the purpose of developing
                        position papers for the East-West trade aspect of the Geneva meeting and for
                        developing recommendations with respect to the China trade control question.
                        The proposed policy revision of July 8, 1955 contained two unresolved
                        points, one relating to the method of applying the United States
                        anti-frustration policy to shipments to friendly countries and the other
                        relating to the timing and procedure of altering United States controls
                        after a finding that Communist China should no longer be regarded as an
                        actual, rather than potential, aggressor. In a memorandum of March 30 to the
                            <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>, the Commerce Department proposed
                        a revision in certain paragraphs in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        152/3 to resolve differences on one of the two unresolved questions—the one
                        relating to the United States anti-frustration policy.</p>
                    <p>2. Subsequent to July 8, 1955 there have been substantial changes in the
                        world situation in general and with respect to East-West trade controls in
                        particular. Prominent among these changes are the following: <list>

                    <p>3. Contrasted with the foregoing pressures for reducing existing controls are
                        the pressures on the United States Government for their retention and
                        improvement, as evidenced by critical attention to this subject by Congress,
                        notably as a result of the <persName corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName>

                            >COCOM</gloss> controls. Furthermore, the United States has attached
                        positive importance on political and psychological grounds to the
                        maintenance of the maximum possible multilateral and unilateral controls
                        towards Communist China.</p>

                    <p>4. Although there has been no basic change in Chinese Communist policies
                        against which the United States unilateral and the multilateral trade
                        controls were initially directed, the foregoing circumstances clearly
                        suggest that the attitude of our <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>

                        controls has materially hardened since July of 1955. A further review of our
                        economic defense policy in the light of the present situation is therefore
                        necessary. This review should take into account all relevant aspects of the
                        problem, including political and military as well as economic defense
                        considerations.</p>

                                circumstances. (The National Security Council decision on April 26,
                                1956 proposed a list of some 81 items to be subject to a liberal
                                exceptions policy, as a part of a negotiating package together with
                                certain compensating concessions to be obtained from other
                                countries. This package has subsequently been judged to be generally
                                unacceptable to two key countries, and in accordance with another
                                part of the same Council decision, should therefore be returned to
                                the Council for review. This new review is all the more imperative
                                as the list of items has been construed by certain agencies to be a

                        cases as precedents to justify similar future cases of their own.</p>
                    <p>The present situation poses a difficult dilemma for the US Government. On the
                        one hand there is a growing determination on the part of most leading <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> countries to effect drastic
                        modifications of <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls and
                        further reduction of <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> controls. On
                        the other hand the US has been opposed to any significant relaxation of the
                        China differential controls. In the face of this unresolved difference of
                        views, it is apparent that we are losing an effective multilateral China
                        trade control program. The general attitude of other <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> countries, together with recent
                        unilateral actions by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in particular,
                        have created a situation where continued opposition by the US to any
                        significant weakening of the controls is now being used by the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and others as an excuse for possible
                        abandonment of the entire multilateral control system on the ground that
                        constant US opposition “to the views of the majority” makes the system
                        increasingly unworkable. This places us in an untenable position in <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>. A differential level of controls
                        over trade with Communist China has been, and continues to be, a basic
                        element in our overall Far Eastern policy strongly supported by Congress and
                        the American public. To salvage as substantial a differential as possible at
                        this juncture, serious consideration should be given to the possibility of
                        modifying China trade controls in the very near future on a basis which
                        would restrain <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> members from
                        unilateral actions which have adverse effects on overall US policy in the
                        Far East. It is our judgment that, unless the US is prepared to concede,
                        however reluctantly, an immediate and significant readjustment of China
                        trade controls, we shall by the end of the year, if not sooner, find

                        April 26, 1956, whereby the United States would tolerate exceptions for a

                        and to certain other negotiating objectives, has been tried with the <gloss

                        wished to expand the list of 81 items subject to liberalized exceptions. A

                    <p>The attached memorandum sets forth an interim course of action for approaches
                        to other countries pending development of definitive policy recommendations
                        by the Economic Defense Advisory Committee by October 31 in accordance with
                        a <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> assignment of July 31. The proposal
                        represents an easement in our earlier negotiating position (including a
                        change to quantitative control for copper wire). In substance we would
                        attempt to find a formula for restraining the use of exceptions, either

                                        unacceptable as a basis for limiting their exceptions. The

                                        of 81. Settlement with the Japanese seems possible if the

                            The Treasury Department believes it highly unlikely that the
                            negotiations recommended by the State Department would result in an
                            interim agreement before the end of November, by which time a new U.S.
                            policy can be expected. The Treasury Department further believes that,
                            if an interim agreement were achieved, it would result in official U.S.
                            blessing to a further “watering down” of the controls. Treasury
                            recommends that the present policy continue to apply for the interim
                            period and that the U.S. continue to oppose extended use of <gloss

                        <item>In accordance with the agreed interim policy, discussions were resumed
                            with the Japanese Embassy on August 20 to seek agreement on a specific
                            list of items for liberalized exceptions treatment. Japanese
                            consideration of this new proposal took a longer time than had been
                            anticipated. Informal advice to our Embassy in Tokyo was that the
                            situation had changed since May when Japan had submitted its
                            counter-proposal (on which the new US proposal made a compromise offer)
                            and that our proposal probably would not be acceptable to Japan. In
                            addition, during the last few weeks the situation in <gloss
                                target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> has continued to deteriorate
                            further as a result of several large exceptions cases under the Doc. 471
                            procedure (prior consultation, quid pro quo justification). Late in July
                            the British licensed shipments of heavy tractors and Land Rovers over
                            our objections and in the face of the informal unanimity “rule” under
                            which <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss>’s have refrained from making
                            exceptional Doc. 471 shipments to Communist China which one or more of
                            the <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss>’s have opposed. Germany and Italy
                            have since been using the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> cases as
                            precedents for similar action.</item>

                        <item>In view of the status of the situation as outlined above, the

                            the interim policy be initiated with the other <gloss target="#t_PC1"
                                >PC</gloss>’s at the earliest possible date. Since we had been
                            unable to reach agreement with the Japanese on the first alternative
                            within a reasonable time and since events were quickly overtaking the US
                            position, the Department determined, consistent with its negotiating
                            authority, that its discussions with the other <gloss target="#t_PC1"
                                >PC</gloss>’s should be along the lines of the more general formula

                                >Randall</persName>’s memorandum of August 16(Reference B). These
                            discussions were held on September 8 with the Japanese Embassy and on

                                >PC</gloss>’s. All of the Embassies agreed to inform us of their

                        <item>To date we have been advised that our proposal is acceptable to Japan

                            the American Ambassador in London to make additional representations to
                            the British Foreign Minister. (Copies of communications with the field
                            and memoranda of conversation have been made available to the interested
                            agencies through established channels.)</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>As a further point, there has been some indication (still difficult to
                            evaluate) from our Embassy in Paris that the French Government, for the
                            time being, will not follow the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                            German lead in licensing prior-consultation items to Communist China and
                            even had stopped licensing Doc. 782 and certain unlisted items. This
                            position did not represent a change in the basic French attitude toward
                            the China differential but rather the Foreign Minister’s desire to
                            follow a policy of “absolute cooperation” with the US during the Suez
                            crisis. An earlier report stated that the British had agreed with the

                                participating countries. The British position is not entirely clear;
                                both the United Kingdom position and that of other participating

                                that the British might favor a date in February rather than

                                a meeting date “if the results were likely to be unfruitful.” Under
                                these circumstances the timing of a meeting is subject to some

                            reasons that Her Majesty’s Government do not feel able to re-impose an

                        <p>“United States Defense and intelligence experts have recently re-examined
                            the problem of copper wire exports to the Soviet Bloc. On the basis of
                            that re-examination, this government continues to believe that copper
                            wire is of such high strategic importance that it should be embargoed to
                            the Soviet Bloc. We believe that this conclusion is strengthened by
                            recent events in which the U.S.S.R. has used and has threatened the use
                            of force in a manner seriously increasing the danger of war not only in
                            Europe but in other parts of the world as well.</p>
                        <p>“It is now proposed that a team of our … experts meet with yours in
                            London to discuss the United States rationale for embargo with a view to
                            reaching agreement on the strategic justification for an upgrading of
                            the controls over the export of copper wire. I would welcome your
                            concurrence to the holding of such talks.</p>
                        <p>“Following completion of these discussions and your government’s
                            reconsideration of the problem, the United States Government <pb n="406"
                                xml:id="pg_406" facs="0438"/>would appreciate being advised of your

                                Kingdom still saw no reason to contemplate an embargo of copper wire
                                exports, but remained willing to listen to U.S. representations on
                                the subject. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested
                                that any such discussion should include the broader question of
                                other proposed additions or deletions to the international list. He
                                also suggested that brief statements of the considerations
                                underlying the U.S. and British positions be prepared as a basis for
                                discussions. This letter was transmitted to the Embassy in telegram

                    <p>1. The interested Washington agencies have reviewed the question as to what
                        action the United States should take in the light of present circumstances
                        (particularly the Near Eastern and Hungarian situations) with respect to
                        multilateral strategic trade controls. The course of action outlined below
                        has been approved by the Economic Defense Advisory Committee.<note n="3"

                    <p>2. The United States, on September 12, 1956, proposed to other participating
                        countries (<gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss>’s), an interim course of action
                        with respect to China trade controls and, conditional upon unanimous <pb
                            n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0439"/>acceptance of the United States
                        proposal, committed the United States Government to participate in a
                        Consultative Group (<gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>) meeting in December
                        1956 to discuss a definitive solution of the problem created by pressures
                        from most of the other <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss>’s for reduction of
                        the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls. Although the
                        majority of <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss>’s responses were prompt and
                        affirmative, two responses, from the United Kingdom and Norway, must be
                        considered to be equivocal. Moreover, a number of the <gloss target="#t_PC1"
                            >PC</gloss>’s have utilized the exceptions procedure to such an extent
                        that not only has the U.S. interim proposal for restraint in this respect
                        not been met, but there is ground for belief that the general effectiveness
                        of the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls has been
                        seriously endangered. When this lack of restraint was called to the
                        attention of Germany, in connection with an important exception case, the
                        German response was to the effect that the U.S. had failed to call a <gloss
                            target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> meeting and consequently the interim policy
                        was regarded by Germany as not being in effect.</p>
                    <p>3. The new situation created by Russian actions in Eastern Europe and the
                        Near East, together with clear evidence of Communist Chinese support for
                        Russian aggressiveness, may provide an opportunity for the U.S. to take the
                        lead in revitalizing the multilateral control structure.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d140fn4">Recent reports indicate uncertainty as to whether other
                                <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss>’s agree with the U.S. appraisal of
                            the current situation. While unwilling to speculate upon the effect of
                            Hungarian developments on <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>/<gloss
                                target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> operations, certain delegates
                            have not restrained their opposition to the existing <gloss
                                target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls level. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> has stated that a <gloss
                                target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> meeting could not be fruitful at this
                            time in view of the international situation, and that France agrees with
                            this (confirmed by the <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> Chairman).
                            Other countries have deplored U.S. failure to call a <gloss
                                target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> meeting, although not taking the
                            initiative to call a meeting themselves. [Footnote in the source
                            text.]</note> At the same time, it is uncertain to what extent the

                        may affect the receptivity of those countries to U.S. views on strategic
                        trade controls. The U.S. Delegation to <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss> (USDEL) has recommended that if it is decided not to

                        because of priority of other high level diplomatic negotiations, further
                        bilateral discussions should be held to emphasize to other <gloss
                            target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss>’s the political reasons making desirable a
                        deferral of a <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> meeting and to attempt to
                        forestall further deterioration in the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"

                    <p>4. In light of the circumstances outlined above it has been decided that high

                    <p>5. The Note at Attachment A refers to the excessive use of <gloss

                            >CHINCOM</gloss> exceptions and may present comments either orally or in
                        writing. It is requested that the following Embassies make specific
                        references as indicated below:</p>
                    <p>[Here follow specific instructions for the Embassies in Bonn, Brussels,
                        London, Paris, Rome, and Tokyo. The instructions referred to particular
                        strategic items to which each of those respective countries had applied
                        exceptions procedures; the Department requested the respective Embassies to
                        “express particular concern” with those exceptions cases.]</p>
                    <p>6. For the Embassies’ information, the US has proposed bilateral talks
                        between US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> defense experts for the
                        purpose of reaching agreement on the strategic justification for an
                        upgrading of the controls over copper wire as a preliminary to US proposals
                        in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>. It is hoped that these
                        discussions will be initiated shortly. If the question is raised, the
                        Embassies may state that the US objective is the embargo of all types of
                        copper wire and cable and that the US hopes other <gloss target="#t_PC1"
                            >PC</gloss>’s will restrict the licensing of these commodities pending
                            <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> resolution of US proposals to
                        upgrade the item.</p>
                    <p>7. If the Embassies are requested to clarify the intent of the reference in
                        the Note to a curtailment of shipments of IL II items, it may be indicated
                        that the US considers (a) <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss>’s should use IL
                        II quotas sparingly, and (b) shipments of items subject to 3(d) control
                        should be made only in accordance with a strict application of the 3(d)
                        requirements … .</p>
                    <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0441"/>
                    <p>8. The <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> meeting referred to in the final
                        paragraph of the Note would be a meeting for the purpose of dealing
                        primarily with the three specific proposals included in the Note, but it is
                        not intended that it would consider proposals for a definitive settlement of
                        the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls.</p>
                    <p>9. The respective Embassies should obtain written statements of the views of
                        the respective governments and forward them promptly to the Department
                        together with reports of the Embassies discussions and their comments
                        thereon as promptly as possible in view of a February 1 deadline for EDAC

                        <p>The Embassy has the honor to refer to conversations held in September of
                            this year between the Department of State and your Embassy in
                            Washington, in which the U.S. Government made certain proposals for
                            restraint in the use of the China Committee (<gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                                >CHINCOM</gloss>) exceptions procedures. It was further indicated
                            that if all the participating countries accepted these proposals as a
                            basis for handling <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>
                            exceptions during the remainder of the year, the U.S. for its part would
                            be willing to participate in a Consultative Group (<gloss
                                target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>) meeting before the end of the year.
                            Although most of the Participating Countries (<gloss target="#t_PC1"
                                >PC</gloss>’s) have now accepted the U.S. proposals for the interim
                            handling of <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> exceptions,
                            certain participating countries did not, and in practice the use of the
                            exceptions procedures by a few <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss>’s has
                            increased beyond reasonable expectations. Most of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss>’s have indicated a desire for a <gloss
                                target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> meeting to deal with the question of the
                                <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls although not
                            necessarily urging a meeting by the end of the year.</p>
                        <p>However, since the time of the September conversations the international
                            situation has drastically altered. The U.S.S.R. has used or threatened
                            force in a manner seriously increasing the danger of war both in Eastern
                            Europe and the Near East. The Chinese Communists have supported these
                            Soviet moves. It is the considered view of this Government that the
                            possibility of aggressive or intensified subversive action by the
                            Communist bloc in the Far East has been significantly increased by these
                            developments.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances, the U.S. believes that efforts to strengthen the
                            free world’s defenses must be intensified, and in particular <pb n="410"
                                xml:id="pg_410" facs="0442"/>that an overall tightening of <gloss

                                >CHINCOM</gloss> controls is an essential step. Specifically, the

                        Economic Defense Advisory Committee has adopted a State Department proposal
                        to hold bilateral discussions with Consultative Group member governments
                        with the objective of an overall tightening of multilateral controls,
                        offering participation in an early <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> meeting
                        if necessary to achieve this objective.</p>
                    <p>This disturbs me.</p>
                    <p>In my view, EDAC has thus taken a substantive position which, in my judgment,
                        lies beyond its frame of reference.</p>
                    <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0443"/>
                    <p>Discussions of this subject, initiated before the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss>, had for their purpose the re-examination of the question
                        of whether or not the China differential should be reduced, or even perhaps
                        eliminated. EDAC has foreclosed that by adopting the State Department
                        proposal that bilateral discussion should go forward on the hypothesis that
                        there should be no change in the differential, and that the current
                        exceptions policy should be tightened.</p>
                    <p>The reason why I am disturbed at the action taken by EDAC is that the
                        President has made it quite clear to me, and to members of the National
                        Security Council, that he believes that controls over trade with the
                        Communist countries should be somewhat liberalized rather than
                        tightened.</p>
                    <p>I recognize, however, that because of my absence, you were unable to consult
                        with me at the time of the EDAC meeting, and that the viewpoint I am here
                        expressing was not available either to you or to the membership, so I do not
                        ask that what you did be rescinded.</p>
                    <p>It does seem to me, however, most urgent that EDAC proceed promptly to
                        consider the formulation of an over-all economic defense policy, pursuant to
                        the request made earlier by <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>. Surely
                        such a policy should be available in advance of the expected <gloss
                            target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> meeting for the guidance of those who will
                        there represent the United States.</p>
                    <p>I shall be prepared to call a meeting of the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss> for the consideration of the recommendations of EDAC for
                        such an overall economic defense policy as soon as they are ready. In view
                        of the fact that a <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> meeting is expected
                        early this year, this policy should be submitted to the <gloss
                            target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> by January 31, 1957.</p>
                    <p>In case it is impossible for EDAC to arrive at consensus, you may submit the
                        matter to the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> with majority and

                        expressing their agencies’ views on trade. He also reported that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> had called a <gloss
                            target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> meeting for the first week in February to
                        consider the recommendations for an overall economic defense policy
                        (February 7) and expected to receive the EDAC paper on this subject by the
                        designated date of January 31. The Chairman, therefore, expressed the hope
                        that the EDAC members could reach agreement on the paper prepared in the
                        Executive Committee. He suggested a paragraph by paragraph review and
                        invited the members to indicate any changes or adjustments which they felt
                        were warranted.</p>
                    <p>In response to a request by the Chairman to brief the members on the
                        development of the paper, the Executive Committee Chairman stated that the
                        Executive Committee had attempted to outline a paper which, in the majority
                        view, might be prepared most expeditiously and, as a basis, used the format
                        devised by the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> staff in 1955 (<gloss
                            target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> 501/6, Enclosure #4). He explained that
                        the EC had reorganized the paper in several respects with the view to making
                        it more readable and understandable.</p>
                    <p>The courses of action with respect to China are presented in the last
                        paragraph of the draft paper so that the mechanics of revision would be made
                        easier. He said that it was the intention of the EC to meet this afternoon
                        to draft a memorandum of transmittal from EDAC to <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss> to accompany the paper presently before EDAC. This
                        memorandum will explain any major changes in policy, justify them to the
                        extent considered necessary, and make such qualifications as EDAC deems
                        advisable because of revisions necessitated by the bilaterals. He said the
                        Executive Committee does not offer this paper as a document constituting in
                        all respects the ideas of the member agencies. It does, however, constitute
                        the best efforts of the Executive Committee to agree on a document.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman suggested that, in view of the deadline, the Group make a
                        concerted effort to agree on a final version of the paper at this meeting.
                        With this objective in mind, the members focused their attention on a
                        paragraph by paragraph review of the draft document before them. Certain
                        agreed changes were made and material, enclosed within brackets, was added
                        to the document to indicate disagreed language supported only by the
                        Department of Commerce.</p>

                        <item>The continued threat to the security of the free world posed by the
                            Sino-Soviet bloc warrants the application against that bloc of such
                            economic defense measures by the U.S. and by the free world as will
                            retard the growth of the war potential of the bloc and reduce its unity.
                            Our attitude and program must be one which will not increase the
                            possibility of war, but rather one which will keep open paths which
                            might lead to a sounder basis for peace. During this period, the courses
                            we take should be based upon the assumption that interference in the
                            trade between the free world and the Sino-Soviet bloc should take place
                            only where a clear advantage to the free world would accrue from such
                            interference. They should also be based upon the assumption that the
                            maintenance of personal, cultural, and commercial contacts between the
                            free world and the European Soviet bloc may have positive advantages
                            during this period of tension and watchfulness. Our policy should
                            reflect flexibility as between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. on the one hand
                            and the U.S. and each individual Eastern European country on the other
                            hand.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The economic defense program should be framed and administered with
                            full recognition of the fact that the economic defense system of the
                            free world is part of the larger system of military and political
                            alliances and, like them, depends upon the cooperative efforts of the
                            free nations. The United States should support the existing free world
                            collective arrangements in the field of trade controls. Accordingly, in
                            determining the economic defense measures which the United States should
                            adopt and those to be urged on other nations, the impact upon the
                            existing system of economic defense as a whole, and upon the free world
                            military and political alliances, should be taken into account.
                            Similarly, in multilateral military and political discussions,
                            consideration should be given to <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0448"

                        then called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> to present
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> briefly summarized the
                        past history of the Council’s efforts to evolve a U.S. economic defense
                        policy. He alluded to the extreme difficulty of the problem, and indicated
                        that the Council had assigned it to the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss> two years ago to complete as a matter of urgency. After a
                        real struggle, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704 had finally been
                        agreed by all the responsible departments and agencies. The main problem,
                        said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>, in developing the
                        new policy was the so-called “China differential”. He expressed the hope
                        that everyone would clearly understand that the policy set forth in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704, if adopted, would constitute a
                        substantial liberalization of existing controls on the trade of the Free
                        World with Communist China. It was essential that the National Security
                        Council be entirely clear on this point. Three main reasons had induced the
                            <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> to recommend this liberalization
                        of controls on Free World trade with Communist China: The first of these
                        reasons was the current extreme tension between the United States and its
                        European allies with respect to this issue and the advanced deterioration in
                        the existing multilateral control structure. Unless the United States were
                        prepared to move in the direction of <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0455"
                        />liberalizing controls on trade with Communist China, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> predicted that the whole
                        multilateral control structure might collapse.</p>
                    <p>The second reason related to the situation of Japan. It was a prime objective
                        of the U.S. Government to see Japan’s economic strength and stability
                        increased. Japan bitterly resented the extra controls which were imposed on
                        Japanese trade with Communist China.</p>
                    <p>The third reason for the move toward liberalizing controls on trade with
                        Communist China was the general policy of the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> Administration to reduce barriers all around the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>Following upon these general remarks, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                            >Randall</persName> said he wished to invite the Council’s attention to
                        certain specific statements in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704. The
                        first of these, he pointed out, was in paragraph 1 on page 3. The second
                        sentence of this paragraph read as follows: “During this period, the courses
                        we take should be based upon the assumption that interference in the trade
                        between the Free World and the Sino-Soviet bloc should take place only where
                        a clear advantage to the Free World would accrue from such interference.”
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> pointed out that
                        suggestions had been made which would have reversed the assumption set forth
                        in this sentence. However, the sentence was practically identical in content
                        with what had been said in the previous policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 152/3) except for the introduction of the term “Sino”, and
                        accordingly he opposed suggestions for any reversal.</p>
                    <p>There being no comment, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>
                        turned to paragraph 13, on page 6, and recommended to the Council the
                        insertion of the term “European” between the terms “selected” and
                        “satellites”.</p>
                    <p>The Council accepted this suggestion, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                            >Randall</persName> turned to paragraph 15, on page 6, reading as
                        follows: “Seek the adoption of effective measures to enforce the agreed
                        scope and severity of the multilateral controls and increase the scope and
                        effectiveness of multilateral exchanges and cooperation in the enforcement
                        field.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> said he had
                        understood that the Planning Board had raised the question as to whether we
                        really “meant business” with regard to this statement—that is, if controls
                        on certain items were relaxed, a real effort would be made to enforce strict
                        controls on whatever agreed items for control remained. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> pointed out that in this case, as
                        in the previous one, the old policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        152/3) had said the same thing in substance. He emphasized that we did mean
                        business with respect to strengthening the remaining controls. He then ended
                        his remarks with a statement to the President that this was substantially
                        the picture. He warned once again that if the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> agreed to recommend <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        5704, its action amounted to a <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0456"
                        />liberalization of the controls on Free World trade with Communist
                        China.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> invited Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> to speak briefly on the matter of
                        U.S. unilateral controls on trade with the Soviet bloc. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> replied that <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704 contemplated no change in the existing
                        U.S. unilateral controls on trade with Communist China. He pointed out that
                        the big problem which had been faced in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        5704 was the problem of obtaining a new and firm position by the United
                        States with respect to the subject of multilateral controls, which controls
                        would presently have to be the subject of negotiations with our allies. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that,
                        notwithstanding Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>’s remarks
                        concerning no change in U.S. unilateral controls, paragraph 13 of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704 called for us to “make appropriate and
                        timely unilateral adjustments …<note n="4" xml:id="d146fn4">Ellipsis in the
                            source text.</note> in the scope and severity of controls maintained
                        toward selected satellites of the USSR, etc., etc.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> expressed the view
                        that U.S. unilateral controls over U.S. trade with Communist bloc countries
                        should be relaxed in phase with the relaxation of the multilateral controls
                        on Free World trade with the Communist bloc. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                            >Randall</persName> replied that this was not the subject of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704. The President expressed the opinion,
                        in agreement with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>,
                        that U.S. unilateral controls should likewise be relaxed.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> inquired whether it
                        was the intention of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704 to continue
                        our present level of controls over Free World trade with North Vietnam. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LJS1">Lay</persName> and others assured the
                        Secretary of State that this was essentially the case, and that our policy
                        in this respect was set forth in the policy paper on Southeast Asia (<gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5612/1).<note n="5" xml:id="d146fn5"><gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5612/1, “U.S. Policy in Mainland
                            Southeast Asia,” was approved by the President on September 5.</note>
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said he would make sure
                        that the point raised by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> was taken care of in the Council’s record of action
                        on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704.</p>
                    <p>Returning to his point, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> said he presumed, then, that <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704 was a policy statement having nothing
                        to do with what course of action the United States followed with regard to
                        controls on its own trade with the Communist bloc countries, and dealt only
                        with the position of the United States regarding multilateral controls on
                        trade with the Sino-Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that one important point did not seem to be covered
                        in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704. Our own position with respect
                        to trade with the Communist countries was much influenced by domestic
                        politics. While, of course, we want our allies to remain strong, which was
                        why we favored the policy set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        5704, <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0457"/>was it not a fact that if
                        Congress comes to feel that we are offering no serious objection to our
                        allies trading with Communist China, we could get into a lot of trouble with
                        the Congress? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> replied
                        with an emphatic affirmative, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> added that our troubles with Congress would be
                        particularly severe if we did not let them know in advance of our plans for
                        permitting the liberalization of Free World trade with Communist China. The
                        President said that he wanted it clearly understood that he agreed with the
                        policy on Communist Chinese trade set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 5704, but he wanted the Council to be aware of the
                        difficulties involved. Furthermore, the President pointed out that if we do
                        not propose to put severe obstacles in the way of our allies trading with
                        Communist China, it seemed to him rather foolish to put such obstacles in
                        the way of our own U.S. trade with Communist China.</p>
                    <p>The President then stated that there was another factor to be considered, the
                        factor that Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> was
                        continually emphasizing—namely, that if there is a relaxation of the
                        controls on trade with Communist China, then all our friends and allies in
                        the Far East will conclude that we are abandoning them. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> agreed that this, too, presented a
                        real difficulty. It would be essential to reassure our friends and allies in
                        the Far East that this move toward a liberalization of the controls on trade
                        with Communist China certainly did not signify any intention on the part of
                        the United States to recognize Communist China. The President confessed that
                        he was much puzzled as to what we were going to say about this remarkable
                        change in our policy on trade controls, both to our own Congress and to our
                        Far Eastern allies.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that it must be
                        explained in terms of the necessity that the United States was under to make
                        some concessions on less essential items in order to retain the controls on
                        the more essential items of trade between the Free World and Communist
                        China.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> warned that if any of
                        the allied countries who trade with Communist China should decide to make
                        use of money and credits from the United States to finance their trade with
                        Communist China or the Soviet Union, such a course of action would be
                        considered inexcusable here at home, and would get the Administration into
                        terrible trouble. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>
                        said this might well be the case, but how could we possibly prevent our
                        allies from using funds of U.S. origin to help finance their trade with the
                        Sino-Soviet bloc? We could never separate out such funds.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then asked Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> to comment. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> pointed out that when all
                        was said and done, the trade of the Free World with Communist China was,
                        even in its totals, not very extensive. Ten years ago this total trade had
                        amounted to $700 <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0458"/>million. Last year
                        it had amounted to only $400 million. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1"
                            >Weeks</persName> stated that he agreed with the policy set forth in
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704, but he strongly recommended
                        that we talk this policy over with <persName>John McClellan</persName>
                        (Senator <persName corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName>) before we
                        proceeded to carry it out, in order to ascertain what kind of storm will be
                        raised in Congress by the adoption of a more liberal system of controls on
                        Free World trade with Communist China. As a second point, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> recommended that the United
                        States try to determine what kind of a quid pro quo the United States could
                        get from its acquiescence in this liberalization. Thirdly, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> pointed out that a recent
                        cable from our Embassy in London made it quite clear to him that the British
                        wanted to go much further in liberalizing trade with Communist China than we
                        in the United States had ever dreamed they wanted to go.<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d146fn6">Apparent reference to telegram 4595 from London, <ref
                                target="#d144">Document 144</ref>.</note> In point of fact, the
                        current British position amounted to the virtual abandonment of Free World
                        controls on trade with Communist China. At the President’s request,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> read the pertinent
                        paragraphs of the cable from London.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> commented that he had
                        supposed that we were well aware that neither the United Kingdom nor Japan
                        would feel that the concessions made in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        5704 to their views went far enough.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that it
                        seemed absolutely true to him, even apart from obvious military
                        considerations, that the United States was altogether justified in
                        maintaining a list of items which the Free World would refuse to ship to the
                        Communist world, for, after all, trade in Communist countries was a state
                        monopoly. Beyond this, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> thought there was a strong justification for the
                        eventual formulation of a single list of controlled items covering both the
                        Soviet [Union] and its satellites on the one hand and Communist China on the
                        other. After all, having the two separate lists, one for Russia and one for
                        others, tended to drive Russia and China closer together. He repeated,
                        however, his view that we were certainly justified in having one agreed
                        International List of controls for really significant items.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> once again warned the
                        Council of the need for consultation and collaboration with Congressional
                        leaders in order to prevent an explosion when the contents of the new policy
                        became known.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> asked about the fate
                        of controls on the sale of copper wire to the Sino-Soviet bloc. In view of
                        the vital importance of this item, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> said that if we sold copper wire to the Sino-Soviet
                        bloc we might just as well sell them everything else on the control
                        list.</p>
                    <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0459"/>
                    <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> and others had
                        commented on the status of negotiations on the sale of copper wire, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> called attention to his
                        proposal for coordinating the implementation of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 5704—namely, that it be referred to the Secretaries of
                        State and Commerce for coordination through existing interdepartmental
                        mechanisms, which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>
                        described. He then posed the question as to whether the Council wanted the
                        policy in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704 taken up with members of
                        Congress prior to its actual implementation. The President thought this
                        should be done. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said he
                        presumed that the object of consultation with Congress was to explain the
                        policy in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704 rather than to condition
                        the action of the Executive Branch on any assent by the Congress. The
                        President said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s
                        interpretation of consultation with the Congress was right.</p>
                    <p>The Director of the Bureau of the Budget expressed the hope that in giving
                        approval to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704, the National Security
                        Council would not give up further exploration of Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s recommendation that we seek a
                        single list of items to be controlled in Free World trade both with the
                        Soviet Union and Communist China. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> pointed out to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1"
                            >Brundage</persName> that this was precisely the intent of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704, which would eventuate in a single
                        list of items to be multilaterally controlled.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> inquired whether it
                        would be Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>’s responsibility
                        to undertake these discussions with Senator <persName corresp="#p_MCHC1"
                            >McClellan</persName>. He pointed out that the reaction of Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName> and his Congressional
                        colleagues might well be such as to cause a reconsideration of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> thought that perhaps we ought not to approve <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704 prior to a discussion with Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName>. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> promised that the record of action
                        would reflect the concern expressed about Congressional reaction to <gloss

                            Sino-Soviet bloc warrants the application against that bloc of such
                            economic defense measures by the United States and by the Free World as
                            will retard the growth of the war potential of the bloc <pb n="429"
                                xml:id="pg_429" facs="0461"/>and reduce its unity. Our attitude and
                            program must be one which will not increase the possibility of war, but
                            rather one which will keep open paths which might lead to a sounder
                            basis for peace. During this period, the courses we take should be based
                            upon the assumption that interference in the trade between the Free
                            World and the Sino-Soviet bloc should take place only where a clear
                            advantage to the Free World would accrue from such interference. They
                            should also be based upon the assumption that the maintenance of
                            personal, cultural, and commercial contacts between the Free World and
                            the European Soviet bloc may have positive advantages during this period
                            of tension and watchfulness. Our policy should reflect flexibility as
                            between the United States and the USSR on the one hand and the United
                            States and each individual Eastern European country on the other

                            full recognition of the fact that the economic defense system of the

                            alliances and, like them, depends upon the cooperative efforts of the
                            free nations. The United States should support the existing Free World
                            collective arrangements in the field of trade controls. Accordingly, in
                            determining the economic defense measures which the United States should
                            adopt and those to be urged on other nations, the impact upon the

                            military and political alliances, should be taken into account.
                            Similarly, in multilateral military and political discussions,
                            consideration should be given to the impact of their courses of action

                        <item>The proposed change affects multilateral controls only. Our unilateral
                            policy, which is stricter than that in the multilateral system, remains
                            unchanged.</item>

                                Branch to be soft toward China. On the contrary, the purpose is to
                                get tough with China by establishing a level of controls that is
                                meaningful, and that will be enforced. At the present rate of <pb

                                will soon be undermined unless a new and effective line can be

                                very sore point with Japan that their European competition, such as
                                the Germans, are permitted to ship to China by transit through the

                                        in the Pacific. To the extent that this can be achieved,
                                        American forces can be brought home, and our military

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> opened the discussion saying
                        that this would be a preliminary run since the Prime Minister wished to
                        discuss this problem further himself. He noted the existence of “virtual
                        unanimity” among both political parties in the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> on China trade. He pointed out that it was becoming
                        extremely difficult to explain the “China differential” in Parliament, and
                        that the British people regard the Russians as their principal enemies
                        rather than the Chinese. He mentioned that the British had made considerable
                        use of the exception procedure but that there was little room for further
                        expansion in this direction. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>
                        said that the British now feel very strongly that the time has come to
                        abolish the differential. He maintained that the present controls harm the
                        free world more than they do the Communists and hence are a political
                        liability. He foresaw little chance that a free Malaya or Hongkong would be
                        willing to operate under a control system in which the China differential
                        was maintained. He said the British also believe the existence of the
                        differential brings the whole system of trade controls into disrepute,
                        making <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0467"/>it harder to maintain them
                        against the USSR and increasing the possibility of the disintegration of the
                        entire system. He said that the US is practically alone in attempting to
                        maintain the differential and that our attitude leads to anti-American
                        feeling in Britain. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> stated that
                        the British and Americans had talked about this question thirteen months ago
                        in Washington<note n="2" xml:id="d150fn2">For the <persName

                                target="#d93">Documents 93</ref> and <ref target="#d94">94</ref>,
                            respectively.</note> and had agreed to an item-by-item review designed
                        to see where relaxations could be made. He said that this examination had
                        produced no results and that Britain could not hold on to the differential
                        much longer. Moreover, he added the British do not believe it is right to do
                        so. He said that the only reason they have stuck to the differential as long
                        as they have was to keep their policy aligned with ours.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that this was a hot subject with us too, although the
                        domestic problem is reversed here. He noted that the emotional feeling in
                        the US about China is stronger than the feeling about Russia due primarily
                        to the casualties suffered during the Korean war and to imprisonment of US
                        civilians by the Chinese Communists. He said it is less a question of
                        intellectual justification than of emotional feeling. The Secretary stated
                        that nevertheless we have been giving renewed consideration to the
                        “possibility of getting rid of the differential”, perhaps by adding a few
                        items to the list and getting rid of the balance. He said that we could not
                        discuss our plans in detail until Congress has been consulted but that we
                        hope to be able to take a fresh international position on this matter within
                        a couple of weeks. The Secretary added that if it could be made clear that
                        an economic shift of this type does not presage a political shift and if at
                        the same time the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could get
                        closer together on the political side it would help us a great deal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked whether the Secretary
                        intended this move on the political side to be public and was answered in
                        the affirmative. Then Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said
                        “many words would have to be eaten in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>”
                        and that considerable public education would be required.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that if we should bring Communist China into the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> it would make the problem which has arisen
                        with the entrance of new members into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        even worse. He said that neither our own interests nor the requirements of
                        the Charter would be met by seating Communist China. He noted that the
                        British have gone along with the moratorium thus far but that it has
                        appeared to us that they were doing so unwillingly. If their support could
                        look more genuine it would help us with the economic problem of the
                        differential.</p>
                    <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0468"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> stated that the change in
                        composition of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership has changed many
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> views. He said now that we have no
                        western working majority, the Chinese Communist capacity for mischief would
                        be even greater.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary suggested that the British might now give some thought as to
                        whether we could strike a balance on these two items. He observed that our
                        positions in Asia have little depth and that people out there are becoming
                        nervous over whether we will accept the Chinese Communists. He added that it
                        was for this reason he gave his recent speech in Canberra on the subject of
                        Communist China which he had not originally intended to do.<note n="3"

                    <p rend="center">CHINA TRADE</p>
                    <p>During the course of the discussion on the Far East yesterday, you asked what
                        our position was about Communist China and the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>We have up to now taken the initiative in putting forward the so-called
                        moratorium procedure. We have some doubt how much longer this may be the way
                        to handle the question of the claim of Communist China to a seat in the
                        United Nations. We will study this sympathetically and keep in touch.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile it would be easier for us to carry our own public with us on this
                        question if in the meantime the question of the <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437"
                            facs="0469"/>China differential had been disposed of quickly and without
                        U.S. opposition.</p>
                    <p>As you will recall I said that we could not continue to go along with that
                        differential for more than a very short period. I understand you will have a
                        proposal to put forward within the next two weeks for the amalgamation of
                        the China and Russian lists. We shall give urgent consideration to such a
                        proposal and meanwhile only wish to urge that any co-ordinated list should
                        be one which could command general respect. With this in mind the existing
                        Russian list itself should be kept under revision and any proposal merely to
                        add certain items from the China list to the Russian list would not in our
                        view obtain general acceptance.</p>

                    <p rend="center">CHINA TRADE</p>
                    <p>We hope very much that the question of the claim of Communist China to a seat
                        in the United Nations can be handled on a basis which presupposes greater
                        unity between us on the substance of the matter.</p>
                    <p>We have a program for dealing with the China differential which has been
                        approved by the National Security Council but as to which we are still in
                        consultation with the Congress. It would, as I recall, amalgamate completely
                        the two lists with an addition of certain items which we consider strategic
                        to what would be the common list and the subtraction of a considerably
                        greater number of items from what is now the China list. However, I think
                        that our proposal contemplates that while there would be a single list there
                        might still be a differential between Russia and China in terms of
                        “prohibition”, “limitation” or “watch”. We shall put this forward just as
                        quickly as we have had the Congressional consultations, which will, we hope,
                        allay serious opposition. Of course, just as it would be easier for you to
                        take a stronger position against Chinese <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438"
                            facs="0470"/>representation in the United Nations if the China trade
                        differential were disposed of to your satisfaction, so from our standpoint
                        it would doubtless be easier to deal with the trade question if we knew that
                        your attitude on the substance of Chinese representation in the United
                        Nations would be more positive.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps we shall in practice have to move forward on both fronts in a
                        somewhat synchronized manner.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Doug</hi>: You will recall that when the question
                        of China trade was discussed at Bermuda Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> informed us that a proposal for dealing with the
                        China differential was under consideration and that he hoped to be in a
                        position to present a fresh position in the next two weeks.</p>
                    <p>It is only just two weeks since the Bermuda talks took place, but in case you
                        have not already heard it from your Embassy in London, I have received
                        instructions from the Foreign Secretary to draw attention to the fact that
                        the Government were put under considerable pressure and criticism about
                        China trade in the debate on Bermuda in the House of Commons on April 1. In
                        fact a Motion has been put down on the Order Paper supported by over 100
                        members on both sides of the House as follows: “That this House deplores the
                        damage which British export trade suffers as a result of the China embargo;
                        endorses the appeal made recently to the Government by the Federation of
                        British Industries and other industrial and commercial organisations; and
                        regrets that the Prime Minister has not been able to announce, as a result
                        of the Bermuda Conference, at least a modification of the embargo.”</p>
                    <p>According to the press this morning the Secretary for Commerce spoke on the
                        subject yesterday and indicated that talks with the other nations concerned
                        would take place “shortly”.<note n="2" xml:id="d153fn2">Apparent reference
                            to <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName>’ remarks on the China
                            trade controls, reported in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>,
                            April 5, 1957.</note> But I see that the same press sources interpreted
                        this as meaning “within three <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0471"
                        />months.” Three months is of course considerably longer than we had
                        understood from what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said
                        at Bermuda, and I shall be grateful if you can give me some early indication
                        which I could pass on to London.</p>
                    <p>I notice too from the press account that any relaxation of the restrictions
                        on trade with China may be accompanied by an increase in the restrictions on
                        trade with the Soviet Union and her satellites. According to the press Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> said that this was a “quid
                        pro quo to be offered if the pressures from our partner nations are
                        successful.” I realise that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> said at Bermuda that consideration was being given to
                        getting rid of the differential by adding a few items to the <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> list and equating the China list to it.
                        But may I also draw attention to the passage in the paper which the Foreign
                        Secretary handed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> on
                        March 23? It read: “We shall give urgent consideration to such a proposal
                        (that is, a proposal for the amalgamation of the China and Russia lists) and
                        meanwhile only wish to urge that any co-ordinated list should be one which
                        could command general respect. With this in mind the existing Russia list
                        itself should be kept under revision and any proposal merely to add certain
                        items from the China list to the Russia list would not in our view obtain
                        general acceptance.”<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3">A note attached to the

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> explained that there is no
                        plan for making changes in the United States controls towards Communist
                        China, and that the problem relates only to the pressures by other countries
                        for a relaxation of the multilateral <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss> embargo. He presented the problem which the United

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then set forth the proposal
                        which the executive branch has arrived at for continuing the embargo to
                        China on all three International Lists, decontrolling the 207 items except
                        those which we can demonstrate as being strategic enough to add to one of
                        the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> International Lists (presumably
                        the lower List II or List III categories), and tightening up the exceptions
                        procedure. He indicated that an initial selection of approximately 40 items
                        had been made by U.S. technicians, but the addition of those items to the
                        lists would depend upon the success of our negotiations.</p>
                    <p>There were a number of questions by the Senators and Representatives
                        clarifying their understanding of the problem faced by the United States and
                        of the executive branch proposal to meet it. These questions reflected
                        interest from the Congressional side in the following points: the U.S.
                        record of general objection to <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>
                        exceptions, the fact that no relaxation under the Battle Act is involved in
                        the proposed action, the fact that other countries are <pb n="442"
                            xml:id="pg_442" facs="0474"/>likely to go their own way unless some
                        modification can be agreed, a belief that the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss> relaxation might be subject to the interpretation of a
                        weakening by the U.S. in its overall policy towards Communist China, and the
                        fact that the proposal has the favorable prospect of adding some items to
                        the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> lists. Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_GTF1">Green</persName> noted at the conclusion of the
                        meeting by way of summary that the United States seemed essentially to be
                        faced with a “choice of evils”. It was specifically suggested that as a
                        matter of tactics, it would be more palatable to the U.S. public if the U.S.
                        proposal could be made by some other country as a compromise between
                        extremes. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said this
                        tactical suggestion would be explored.</p>
                    <p>It was understood that the Department would put out a brief press statement
                        at the end of the day following consultation later in the afternoon with the

                        proposals may be negotiated to the maximum extent as a package in order to
                        reach an early settlement of the problem. If the Department is successful in
                        accomplishing this objective it may be possible to avoid extensive technical
                        discussions in <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>The United States Government has given careful study to the question of
                            the multilateral China trade controls in an attempt to find a settlement
                            which will take account of the differing views of participating
                            countries. The United States for its part continues to believe that
                            special trade controls towards Communist China are warranted for
                            political and strategic reasons. The United States is well aware,
                            however, of the political and commercial pressures in other countries
                            for a revision of controls. It considers that an agreed solution of the
                            problem can be reached if accommodations are made by each of the
                            participating countries to the views of the others.</p>
                        <p>The United States accordingly will be putting forward in <gloss
                                target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> proposals (attached) which
                            would provide an enlarged area for trade by other participating
                            countries with Communist China but would also maintain effective
                            multilateral controls towards Communist China covering categories of
                            significant strategic importance at a level more restrictive than that
                            applied to trade with the European Soviet bloc. The differential
                            treatment towards Communist China which the United States proposes that
                            the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> continue would take the
                            form of continued embargo to Communist China of all items on the
                            International Lists II and III in addition to List I. The United States
                            is prepared to consider the decontrol of the 207 items on the
                            Consolidated China Special list except for those items which are
                            sufficiently strategic to warrant their addition to International List
                            III (with continued embargo to Communist China). We anticipate that
                            there may be approximately 50 such items which the United States would
                            wish to propose for addition to International List III. The United
                            States will communicate this list to other participating countries prior
                            to the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> meeting.</p>
                        <p>The items selected resulted from an intensive intelligence and technical
                            review of the entire Consolidated China Special List. In this review
                            particular attention was given to those sectors of the economy which the
                            Communist Chinese are developing rapidly in order to support their
                            military efforts. We recognize that the Communist <pb n="446"
                                xml:id="pg_446" facs="0478"/>Chinese can obtain many categories of
                            goods directly from the European Soviet bloc countries and that some
                            goods, not now on International List I or II, can also move freely from
                            Free World sources to the USSR and the European satellites and then be
                            transshipped to Communist China. We found, however, that there are some
                            types of goods which appear to be in short supply throughout the
                            Sino-Soviet bloc countries and which for that reason are more difficult
                            for Communist China to procure by any means. It is believed that
                            continued embargo of such items will have a real effect upon the
                            Communist Chinese capabilities to wage war.</p>

                    <p>In transmitting the U.S. proposal Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTV1"
                            >Kalijarvi</persName> made the following points: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>Early in January the United States outlined its views on the
                                importance of maintaining the present special controls towards
                                Communist China and tightening the overall <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                    >COCOM</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>
                                controls in light of the events in Hungary and the Near East.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>The United States has reviewed the question of the special China
                                controls in the light of the responses by participating countries to
                                the U.S. evaluation of January. We now have a proposal which takes
                                account both of the security interests relating to trade controls
                                towards Communist China and of the political and commercial
                                pressures brought to bear on certain participating
                                governments.</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>The proposal has been discussed with the interested Congressional
                                leaders and hence represents a proposition which the United States
                                can advance with confidence to other countries.</item>
                            <label>(4)</label>
                            <item>The United States considers that an agreed solution of the problem
                                can be found if accommodations are made by each of the participating
                                countries to the views of the others.</item>
                            <label>(5)</label>
                            <item>With respect to the list of 50 items referred to in the proposal
                                attached to the Aide-Mémoire, the United States has not fully
                                completed the selection of items but expects to be in a position to
                                transmit the list to the embassies early in the week of April
                                22.</item>

                            <item>The United States is giving its proposal to the participating
                                countries in advance of the May 7 meeting in the belief that advance
                                knowledge may facilitate the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                                    >CHINCOM</gloss> discussion.</item>
                            <label>(7)</label>
                            <item>A response to the United States proposal is not essential,
                                although any comment which the respective embassies might have to
                                make would be welcomed by the Department. The United States
                                intention is to carry on substantive negotiations in the
                                multilateral forum rather than through bilateral discussions. We
                                would hope for the support of the respective governments on the U.S.
                                proposal.</item>

                            <item>The United States proposals are set forth as a package in the hope
                                that an item-by-item review may be avoided.</item>
                            <label>(9)</label>
                            <item>The United States should attempt to hold publicity with respect to
                                the April 17th discussions to a minimum, but if pressed might find
                                it necessary to acknowledge that conversations had been held with
                                respect to the question of China trade controls. No reference would
                                be made to the fact that the United States had made a
                                proposal.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Each of the embassy representatives stated that the U.S. proposal would be
                        promptly referred to their respective capitals for consideration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJHJ1">Smith</persName> made inquiry as to U.S.
                        intentions with respect to copper wire. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTV1"
                            >Kalijarvi</persName> indicated that the United States has not ceased to
                        press for embargo of this item and would expect to press further but not
                        specifically as a part of the negotiations relating to the China trade
                        controls.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Ortona</persName> said that he appreciated the desire of the
                        United States for a package consideration of the China differential problem
                        and of the U.S. proposal, but he felt it to be probable that the Italian
                        Government would wish to urge the deletion of bearings from the <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> embargo.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Landy</persName> inquired whether it was expected that the
                        United States would revise its own controls on the pattern of its proposal
                        to <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KTV1">Kalijarvi</persName> said that the U.S. position with
                        respect to its own controls would remain unchanged and that our proposal
                        represented an accommodation to our <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss> partners rather than a proposal for change in the U.S.
                        controls. Mr. <persName>Landy</persName> also expressed interest in
                        obtaining any information which might properly be made available to him with
                        respect to the foreign trade of Communist China or the information
                        underlying the United States selection of items for retention. He agreed
                        with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTV1">Kalijarvi</persName>’s statement that
                        the potential trade of Communist China was vastly overrated by countries
                        desiring to increase their trade with Communist China.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese had a number of questions of clarification. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KTV1">Kalijarvi</persName> confirmed for them the fact that
                        a similar approach was being made to other participating countries, that
                        reference to April 17th discussions to the press should be kept as general
                        as possible, <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0481"/>that we visualize

                        there had been no detailed discussion of China trade controls between the

                            <persName>Shimoda</persName> expressed interest in the nature of the
                        consultation with the Congress and made comments indicating that he hoped
                        the United States would not have a completely inflexible position with
                        respect to the negotiability of the 50 items.<note n="3" xml:id="d156fn3"

                    <p>2380. In our meeting April 20 Kishi read from talking paper entitled “China
                        Trade and Problems Concerning Communist China,” covering relaxation of China
                        trade controls, establishment of trade agency in Communist China, relations
                        between Nationalist China and Communist China and observations on
                        Russian-Chinese relationship. In preliminary remarks before reading from
                        paper, Kishi stressed that government and conservatives had decided on firm
                        policy regarding Communist China including a) advancement of trade to
                        maximum possible extent and b) Japan had no intention of recognizing or
                        opening diplomatic relations with Peking regime in foreseeable future. He
                        stressed that comments contained in paper should be considered in light of
                        these fundamental principles. He pointed out that while Socialists were
                        demanding recognition of Peking, Conservatives flatly rejected this point of
                            view.<note n="2" xml:id="d157fn2">In telegram 2381 from Tokyo, April 20,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> reported on a
                            conversation that he had with Kishi immediately after presentation of
                            his talking paper. “I said US was most sympathetic to Japan’s trade
                            problems,” the telegram reads in part. “In fact, only yesterday copies
                            of proposals we would introduce in <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                                >CHINCOM</gloss> were given Japanese Embassy by Dept which were
                            designed to effect some liberalization of China trade controls. I
                            expressed hope of my Govt that Kishi and his Govt would favor these
                            proposals and support them in China Committee even though they did not
                            provide for total abolition China differential which PM sought.” During
                            their talk, Kishi was handed a note, and, after reading it, told
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> that “he had just
                            been informed Japanese Embassy did receive US proposal for possible
                            relaxation China trade control but noted with regret that China
                            differential persisted. He asked for further, and he hoped favorable,

                            me. He added that it might be possible for Japanese Govt officials to
                            understand US rationale but Japanese public did not, and therein lies
                            the gap between the two countries.” (<hi rend="italic"

                    <p>At the opening session of the China Committee meeting in Paris on May 7, the
                        United States Delegation presented a proposal for revision of the
                        multilateral controls on trade with China. The proposal followed closely the
                        Department of State instructions in CA–8615, <ref target="#d155">Document
                            155</ref>. The French Delegation also submitted a proposal at this
                        meeting, which called for the immediate abolition of all special controls on
                        trade with China. Polto 2645 from Paris, May 8, noted that a deadlock
                        ensued, in which unanimous agreement for either the United States or the
                        French proposal was evidently unobtainable. It was clear, the Delegation
                        reported, that the United States proposal was not acceptable in its present
                        form, and that an item-by-item review was not imminent. (Department of
                        State, Central Files, 493.009/5–857)</p>

                            <p>“USDel unaware possible recent discussions between Embassy Tokyo and
                                Japan Government. However view intransigent position Japan delegate

                                recommend Washington consider representations either by Department
                                or in Tokyo urging some flexibility Japan position and sympathetic

                            493.009/5–1457)</p></note> repeated Tokyo Polto 28. As Department aware
                        I urged Kishi to support United States proposals in <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>. After consideration he took
                        position differential between <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>
                        and Communists should be abolished. Position Kishi has taken reflects
                        virtually unanimous view of Japanese people in all walks of life including
                        socialists, conservatives, business, industry and labor and therefore is a
                        domestic political issue of great importance to Kishi.</p>
                    <p>Because of tremendous pressure in Japan from all sectors of national life I
                        doubt that Japanese Government will be disposed to accept position that is
                        less liberal than position Britain is willing to accept.</p>
                    <p>Kishi however may possibly modify position to abolish differential if we are
                        forthcoming enough and show sufficient flexibility in our position.</p>
                    <p>We must, of course, try maintain differential at highest feasible level but
                        my fear is that if we try to maintain differential at too high level we risk
                        collapse <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> structure which will
                        inevitably have effect on maintaining entire voluntary control
                        structure.</p>
                    <p>I doubt that further representations to the Japanese Government will prove
                        productive unless the modifications of United States proposal outlined
                        paragraph 6 reference telegram are approved for presentation in Paris. In
                        that case I can urge Japanese Government to support revised United States
                        position although there is no certainty that suggested modifications will be
                        acceptable to Japanese.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>We have reached a rather critical phase in our negotiations with the British,
                        Japanese, French, et al., with reference to China trade controls.</p>
                    <p>I received yesterday a strong memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_LS1"
                            >Selwyn Lloyd</persName> pointing out that the British would have to
                        gain greater freedom in respect to China trade and do so quickly because of
                        their parliamentary situation. He also said that there was rising criticism
                        of the United States in areas where there was unemployment, which was
                        ascribed, rightly or wrongly, to our refusal to let them trade with China.
                        The Japanese are in this matter aligned closely with the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, who is handling this
                        matter for us, believes that we can obtain agreement with the United Kingdom
                        only if we agree to a substantial reduction of the present differential
                        between China trade and Soviet trade. We could perhaps maintain a
                        differential to the following extent: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Prohibiting the sale to Communist China of items which, as regards
                                the Soviet Union, are on a quantitative limitation basis;</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>While maintaining the <hi rend="italic">principle</hi> of embargo
                                in the case of China for those items which, in the case of Russia,
                                are on a “watch” basis, agreeing that they, or most of them, be
                                subject to the so-called “exceptions procedure”. This would allow
                                sale of these items by our allies after advance notification so as
                                to permit of our interposing objection if this seemed desirable and
                                feasible.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Adding to the list dealt with in paragraph 2 above a few items
                                which are now not on any of the Russian lists. However, these
                                additions would probably not be of great significance.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>From the standpoint of our Congressional relations and probably from the
                        standpoint of our relations with such anti-Communist allies as Korea,
                        Formosa, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines, we would be better off to
                        let the British, Japanese, etc., “go it alone”. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                            >Walter Robertson</persName> believes, and I am inclined to concur, that
                        it <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0488"/>would be better for us to let
                        the British, Japanese, etc., “go it alone” because the fact of our acceding
                        to a substantial elimination of the China differential would be widely
                        regarded in Asia as foreshadowing a policy of lessening opposition to the
                        Chinese Communists which might precipitate widespread efforts by Asian
                        countries to seek an accommodation with Peiping.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, to split with the British, Japanese and most of the other
                        trading countries on this issue would obviously have undesirable
                        implications. If they start “going it alone”, we cannot be sure that they
                        will stop with the present measures. These could constitute a precedent
                        which, if pursued, could lead to a breakdown of the basic strategic controls
                        which apply both to the Soviet Union and to China. Also it would give rise
                        to somewhat greater anti-foreign sentiment in the Congress which may
                        militate against assistance to, and cooperation with, our European allies.
                        If we agree with them, we will absorb some of the criticism which otherwise
                        they alone would bear.</p>
                    <p>My suggestion is that you and I should send messages to <persName
                            corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1"
                            >Lloyd</persName>, respectively, to the effect that we cannot go all the
                        way to meet them and that they must go further to meet us, and then that we
                        give <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Douglas Dillon</persName>, who is directing

                            <p>Our military advisers are strongly of the opinion that many of the
                                items which you would take off the China list will in fact
                                appreciably help the Chinese Communists to build up the military

                                primary responsibility to resist. Our Congress, although less well
                                informed on the technical details, feels strongly on this issue. As
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName> is saying to

                                confident that increasing the list will really help your trade very
                                much. May it not mean merely that China’s trade with you will
                                consist of the more strategic rather than the less strategic

                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Dear <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName>: I have your note
                                of May 13th about the China trade controls. We are very anxious to
                                find a basis for agreement and not to put added strain upon our
                                relations. However, we cannot go all the way to meet you and in
                                effect wholly abolish the differential. In our opinion, this
                                differential has a real significance in retarding the buildup of
                                Communist China’s vast military potential. On the other hand
                                liberalizing the list will not, we believe, lead to any substantial
                                increase in the volume of trade. It will, I fear, mean that the
                                Chinese Communists’ rather limited possibility of buying abroad will
                                merely shift from less critical to more critical items, the total
                                value remaining substantially static.</p>
                            <p>However, we are giving increased discretion to our negotiators in
                                Paris in a genuine effort to achieve a result which you can accept
                                and thus keep our cooperation going in this field. But as I say, we
                                cannot go all the way that you would want.</p>
                            <p>What we are doing represents a great effort within the Executive
                                Branch of Government and with the Congress to meet you. But if this
                                is not acceptable, and you should decide that you are unable to
                                continue cooperation with us in this area, it will, of course, have
                                a bad reaction in this country. We shall do our very best to hold
                                those reactions to a minimum, but we cannot give any assurance that
                                it will not have troublesome repercussions.</p>

                    <p>At the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> meeting of May 17, the
                        United States Delegation presented a modified set of proposals on the China
                        trade control question. According to the United States proposal, an embargo
                        would be maintained on 26 items on List II and 52 items on List III, all of
                        which would continue to be subject to very strict control with prior
                        consultation and quid pro quo justification. <gloss target="#t_Topol1"
                            >Topol</gloss> 2172 to Paris, May 13, had instructed the United States
                        Delegation to present a proposal along those lines. (Department of State,
                        Central Files, 493.009/5–1157)</p>
                    <p>At that meeting, the United Kingdom regretted that it did not regard these
                        new proposals as providing the basis for an agreement, since the United
                        States proposals did not meet any of the criteria on which the French
                        proposal was based and which the British had fully supported. The text of
                        the British remarks were transmitted to the Department in Polto 2730 from
                        Paris, May 17. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 493.009/4–1757)</p>
                    <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0491"/>
                    <p>Polto 2739 from Paris, May 17, offered the United States Delegation’s
                        comments on the future development of the China trade control negotiations,
                        suggesting several different courses of action which the United States might
                        follow. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 493.009/5–1757) Polto 2741 from
                        Paris, May 17, commented on the reactions of the various Participating
                        Countries to the United States proposals of May 17, noting that “no delegate
                        accepted US proposal.” Polto 2740 from Paris, May 17, reported that the
                        positions of the various delegates regarding the United States and French
                        proposals introduced on May 7 “remain essentially unchanged.” The majority
                        of the Participating Countries, it noted, “still favor French proposal and,
                        either support it completely, or state solution must be found close to that
                        proposal.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</p>

                            >Dillon</persName> at his request this afternoon to discuss the question
                        of China trade controls. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        stated that high level messages had been sent to London on this subject. The
                        Ambassador replied that he had received copies of these messages. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> went on to review the
                        background of the China Controls Negotiations and stressed the concessions
                        already made by the United States delegation. He emphasized the importance
                        of reaching an agreement which, while permitting increased trade in items of
                        minor strategic importance, would nonetheless maintain more than a token
                        differential.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> drew the Ambassador’s
                        attention to provisions in the Battle Act which required economic and
                        military aid to be with-drawn <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0492"/>from
                        countries which were not “effectively cooperating” in East-West trade
                        controls. He emphasized that the Department was in no way threatening the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> with this possibility but that he felt
                        that it was important that the British Government be aware of this statute,
                        adding that the President had no discretion on Title II items. He made it
                        clear that we felt it most important that no statements be made which might
                        result in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> being accused of <hi
                            rend="italic">not</hi> “effectively cooperating” at this time. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> recalled the case of
                        Ceylonese rubber in which a shipment to China of this strategic commodity
                        had been condoned owing to the special circumstances which applied at the
                        time.</p>

                                compromise solution proves unobtainable, it would seem better at
                                least to get this thing out of the way and I hope you will feel the
                                same. We have so many things that we must do together that it seems
                                better to face this issue now. But I ought to say how grateful I am

                        Chinese business has become almost as much an obsession with us as it
                        appears to be with your Congress. Quite between ourselves as old friends I
                        do not think there is much in it. You say that if we get what we want the
                        Chinese will only switch their trade from one item to another. That may very
                        likely prove true but traders never think like that. Each individual firm
                        and industry believes that it can increase its own sales, and of course in
                        our country, which only lives by exports, this is quite an important
                        factor.</p>

                    <p>If there is any chance of a compromise that gives us the substance of what we
                        want and you something to argue with Congress, then of course we will accept
                        it. You will say that this is not much of a compromise, but that is the way
                        of the world. Frankly I would much rather have an agreement with you than a
                        disagreement. But if, as I assume, we cannot get a compromise of this kind,
                        I am very sorry to tell you that I shall have to stick to the line shared by
                        that large number of countries, including the great majority in Europe, who
                        want to bring the Russian and Chinese List together.</p>
                    <p>I feel that this is not really a great issue compared to the immense problems
                        that you and I have to face. It is just a matter of handling our people. It
                        is very hard to persuade the English that the Chinese are more dangerous
                        than the Russians but I realise that the reverse is the case with your
                        people. I feel sure that it may be better to get this difference settled
                        rather than let it go on and poison our relations. We have so many problems
                        much more important than this which we have got to face together.<note n="3"

                        United States Delegation to support Proposal A, but not Proposal B,
                        indicating that “while compromise goes beyond US proposals in <gloss

                        one abstained, and another requested instructions from its government. The
                        Department reported the results of the meeting of May 24 in telegram 2598 to
                        Tokyo, also sent to Copenhagen, Lisbon, and Oslo. The telegram explained
                        that the “Department wishes make final further attempt isolate <gloss

                        the Department had already been in touch with the Embassy in Ottawa in an
                        effort to persuade the Canadian Government to support Proposal A and
                        instructed the missions receiving the telegram to approach the respective
                        governments “at highest level likely produce satisfactory results,”
                        informing them of the importance that the United States attached to the
                        multilateral trade control issue and urging them to support Proposal A. (<hi

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> today called in <persName
                            corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> to review China trade controls.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> was not informed on most
                        recent developments, but said he had talked with Pineau after earlier
                        presentation and found him very sympathetic to US view. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> explained that only important
                        trading country now in position supporting British is France and urged
                        consideration by France of desirability shifting position so as to maintain
                        cooperative international arrangement. Maintenance of French position will
                        inevitably affect Franco-American relations in other fields during coming
                        months. Emphasized that Americans feel about China as France feels about
                        Egypt, that US carries free world defense burden in Far East, and that
                        failure to reach agreement likely have most unfortunate repercussions on US
                        public opinion and Congressional circles despite what US Government might
                        like or want. There is a feeling on part of Government at highest levels
                        that other countries may not properly recognize US responsibilities or how
                        we feel in the circumstances. Referred to fact that Japan is now prepared
                        accept compromise proposal A, as well as a number of other trading nations.
                        Further emphasized that elimination differential would probably not alter
                        size of China trade but simply change composition to include items of
                        greater strategic interest to Commie China. <persName corresp="#p_AH1"
                            >Alphand</persName> agreed that problem of trade with China was not
                        important either politically or economically to France. He promised advise
                        his Government at once and implied he would support US position of urging
                        his Government accept proposal A.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> informed <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> that he had recommended to Paris
                        that French support US compromise position in May 21 meeting. In view fact
                        French Govt did not follow <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName>’s
                        recommendation and has not bothered to inform him of recent developments, we
                        concerned that his cables may not be getting high level consideration due
                        present political crisis.</p>
                    <p>Therefore request Ambassador call on Pineau or Mollet this weekend to
                        emphasize US position and urge acceptance Plan A compromise by Monday in

                        I returned from Denmark this morning and have been discussing with <persName
                            corresp="#p_SHE1">Harold</persName> and other colleagues the question of
                        China Trade Controls. Like you I am very anxious to find a basis for
                        agreement. I feel, however, that to reach an agreement which would not in
                        substance abolish the differential would mean continued bitterness and
                        recrimination in this country. As you know to differentiate between China
                        and the Soviet Union seems wholly illogical to every shade of political
                        opinion here. If we now make an agreement maintaining the differential we
                        shall be under constant pressure to take the matter up with you again and
                        considerable harm could be done to our good relations. Therefore, we feel
                        that it is right to grasp the nettle now. Quite frankly the two compromises
                        put forward in the committee this week leave the differential in existence
                        and affect a number of items regarded by our exporters as <pb n="465"
                            xml:id="pg_465" facs="0497"/>of the essence of the problem. Therefore we
                        have decided that our line at the meeting on Monday<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d171fn2">May 27.</note> will continue to be that the
                        differential should be abolished. In an effort, however, to help, we shall
                        tell the Committee that we will willingly cooperate to see that quotas so
                        far as certain items subject to quantitative control are concerned are kept
                        as low as possible. There can be detailed discussion about these items
                        between officials. Secondly, we will say that we will seek to speed up the
                        watch procedure for items on the Watch List. We will certainly co-operate in
                        seeing that the China Committee has full information rather more speedily
                        than has been the case in the past over Watch List items for Russia. I am
                        afraid that this decision will be unpalatable but I believe that it is the
                        only basis upon which we shall keep any system of strategic controls
                        generally accepted and working in practice.</p>
                    <p>I am most grateful to you for your personal efforts to try to work out a
                        basis for a compromise and I know that you will do your best to limit the
                        reactions to our decision in the United States. We too will try to do all we
                        can to play down this difference of opinion.<note n="3" xml:id="d171fn3">The

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Friend</hi>: Many thanks for your letter of May
                            24.<note n="2" xml:id="d174fn2"><p>That letter reads in part:</p>
                            <p>“I have been trying to follow in a general way negotiations going on
                                between the several countries on the Russian-Chinese trade
                                differential. As an individual I agree with you that there is very
                                little of profit in the matter either for your country or for any
                                other. Commercially, it affects this nation not at all, for the
                                simple reason that we have a total embargo on Chinese trade.
                                However, many of our people think that the free nations could make a
                                terrific psychological blunder in this matter and possibly even lose
                                all the areas of the Southeast that have strong Chinese
                                minorities.</p>
                            <p>“We understand your predicament and even though we may be compelled,
                                in the final result, to differ sharply in our official positions, I
                                think that each of our Governments should strive to prevent the
                                possible popular conclusion in its own country that we are committed
                                to going ‘separate ways’.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> DDE
                                Diaries)</p></note> I will write to you a little later about some of
                        the other points you mentioned, but I should reply at once about the
                        Russian-Chinese trade question. I am very glad that you understand our
                        special difficulty about this matter. As you realise, the commercial
                        interests of our two countries in this are not at all alike. We live by
                        exports—and by exports alone. So I feel that we cannot any longer maintain
                        the existing differential between Russian and Chinese trade and we shall be
                        making a statement to this effect in Parliament tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>The Russian list is an extensive one, covering over 250 items, and so trade
                        with China will still be severely limited. Indeed we believe that a common
                        list will prove to be the right way of maintaining a viable system of
                        control over trade with Communist countries. Most of the other countries
                        concerned seem to think that what we propose is common sense.</p>
                    <p>Of course we shall stress that we mean to continue co-operating with you and
                        our allies in controlling trade with both the Soviet bloc and China in the
                        interests of our mutual security. I trust that this will be made clear also
                        in the United States. There is no division of view on this and we shall
                        emphasise this again. I agree that we must try to play down this difference
                        of view between us and do all we can to prevent the misconception that we
                        have different policies on strategic controls, or on the great issues that
                        lie beneath all this.</p>

                            caused the furor that could have taken place. I have heard nothing yet
                            of the reaction in the South East Asian countries.” The letter was

                    <p rend="center">MEMORANDUM ON CHINA TRADE CONTROL NEGOTIATIONS</p>
                    <p>Negotiations on multilateral China trade controls began in <gloss
                            target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> on May 7. The French proposed
                        immediate abolition of all special China controls except for the 25 items
                        under quantitative control to the Soviet Bloc. Quantitative limits for the
                        export of these items to China were to be set within six months. In
                        accordance with <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704/1 the United
                        States, while seeking to maintain a significant differential in the level
                        and severity of controls applied to Communist China as compared with the
                        Soviet Union, proposed a substantial relaxation of the existing special
                        China controls. After hearing the two proposals, twelve of the sixteen
                        participating countries, led by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>,
                        supported the French proposal, and it became obvious that the initial United
                        States position would have to be modified if any agreement were to
                        result.</p>
                    <p>During the course of the ensuing negotiations the United States made a number
                        of relatively important concessions in an attempt to reach agreement. While
                        these concessions did not rally any substantial support, they markedly
                        changed the atmosphere of the negotiations <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469"

                        possible compromise solution.</p>
                    <p>This plan would have maintained a differential on China trade, essentially
                        limited to the 25 items under quantitative control to the Soviet Union, and
                        represented the maximum concession possible if a differential was to be
                        maintained. In a final attempt to reach agreement it was accepted by our
                        delegation without change.</p>
                    <p>This compromise was also supported by the Germans, the <gloss
                            target="#t_Benelux1">Benelux</gloss> countries, the Italians, Turks, and
                        Greeks, a total of eight countries, including the United States. The
                        Canadians maintained a neutral position. Led by the United Kingdom the plan
                        was opposed by France, Japan, Norway, Denmark and Portugal.</p>
                    <p>At this point it became clear that the only hope of moving the United Kingdom
                        was to rally unanimous support for this compromise from the other countries.
                        Determined efforts to sway these countries were unsuccessful, and, at least
                        in the case of France, it became clear that there must have been a prior
                        binding commitment to support the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>
                        position to the end.</p>
                    <p>The result was the declaration by the British of their intent to proceed on
                        their own to terminate the differential entirely. This will force the other
                        countries to follow suit and the China trade differential is therefore gone.
                        All countries have agreed, however, to apply to Communist China the same
                        controls now applied to the Soviet Bloc countries in Europe; and there will
                        be a negotiation of quotas for China on the List II (quantitative control)
                        items.</p>
                    <p>While we were unsuccessful in maintaining the differential, our negotiators
                        succeeded in aligning a majority with us, proved that we were flexible and
                        cooperative, and created by their reasonableness, substantial good will
                        among all the other negotiating countries.</p>
                    <p>If we had been able to accept something like the proposed compromise about
                        six months or a year ago, we might have been able to retain a significant
                        differential. Our failure to consider a modified position at an earlier date
                        apparently led the British to conclude that our concessions would never be
                        enough to suit them, and consequently to promise their domestic pressure
                        groups, before negotiations began, that they would not agree to the
                        maintenance of any differential at all. Although they recognized that we had
                        gone a long way to accommodate ourselves to their problem, they were
                        apparently so firmly committed that they could not consider our position on
                        its merits.</p>

                    <p>The Japanese Ambassador then (he told me he would not have discussed anything
                        of the substantive nature had not the President opened the discussion)
                        commented on the easing of trade restrictions with Red China. He stated to
                        the President that the decision by Great Britain had put the Japanese
                        Government in an extremely embarrassing position and further stated that the
                        Japanese Government’s primary interest was in continuing their position at
                        the side of the United States Government, though an action such as the
                        British made it difficult. The President said he appreciated that and
                        realized that there would be many times when there would not be an identical
                        position taken by all of our allies. He pointed out that we had not agreed
                        with the French and British in the Suez crisis but that we had stuck to the
                        policy that we felt would be just. Then he elaborated to the Ambassador that
                        he felt that no doubt France would follow suit in trading with Red China and
                        after France, possibly Italy and others. He continued that he felt it
                        extremely important for Japan with ninety million people and an agrarian
                        territory the size of California to trade for their very survival. The
                        President added that the Administration had more or less inherited the
                        position of the embargo on the Red Chinese and he was more or less of the
                        opinion that it was wise to trade as much as possible with practically all
                        nations. He stated he felt that one could in many instances interest the
                        people in these countries in our way of life and in his opinion a corollary
                        objective was not to allow their own countries, in this instance Japan, to
                        be honeycombed with red cells which would “fascinate the peoples of their
                        country with another way of life.” The Ambassador thanked the President for
                        his understanding position and stated that he hoped there would be as little
                        disagreement as possible in our negotiations between the two countries.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Document 5704/1 (Tab A) and,
                        therefore, a further top level directive is immediately necessary.<note

                        again on June 6 to redraft portions of that document (presumably primarily
                        paragraphs 20 and 21) to reflect the changed conditions.</p>
                    <p>The discussion leading to this conclusion is summarized in section 2
                        below.</p>
                    <p>The Defense member, Colonel <persName corresp="#p_GTF1">Green</persName>,
                        reported that he understood that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"

                        the meeting in which this action is being decided was still in session.
                        (Presumably this would mean by-passing EDAC and <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss>.) After the meeting he also hinted that Admiral <persName

                    <p>It is under such circumstances, returning team members stated, that the US

                        immediately.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman of the Executive Committee proposed, and his proposal was
                        accepted by the Committee, that we had “pursued to the end” the policy
                        outlined in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Document 5704/1, and he made
                        specific reference to paragraph 21. The Commerce member noted that even by
                        being present at <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> meetings the
                        USDel would be exceeding its authority; the Chairman added that we must have

                    <p>The State member brought up the possibility of instructions to the USDel to

                            >CHINCOM</gloss> that the USDel is doing so without prejudice to the US
                        position, but in the ensuing discussion the Commerce member held that “no
                        matter how you slice it” the US would be acquiescing to the British action
                        in unilaterally eliminating the China differential. The representative of
                        Commerce on the Paris team added that in his view all further discussion
                        must be preceded by a US policy decision.</p>

                        that it may be worth while to take now a position valid only in the short
                        run because as indicated by the German example concern at disruption of
                        Western unity may lead to a stiffening attitude on the part of some <gloss

                        recapture unity on issue. He said he felt <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474"

                    <p>In reply Kishi, who evidently has been well briefed on subject, said he could
                        assure me Japan would refrain from taking in immediate future any such

                        Japan would follow general lines of compromise Plan “A”, which he understood
                        had been supported by US and majority members <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss>. He said however that this was for time being and that
                        because of strong sympathy and support public opinion and influential
                        business circles for <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> action and concern
                        over future Japan’s China trade in light thereof, it would be difficult to
                        maintain indefinitely. Kishi reiterated, however, that he believed it
                        essential that any action likely to destroy free world solidarity must be

                        took with respect to the China differential in East-West trade.</p>
                    <p>The full degree of liberalization authorized by action in <gloss

                        when offered by our negotiators, proved to be insufficient, and Great
                        Britain announced that, by unilateral policy, she intended to eliminate the
                        differential completely. It now seems clear that her example will be
                        followed by other countries, and that the differential, as a part of
                        multilateral policy, will disappear.</p>
                    <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0507"/>
                    <p>As soon as this highly significant change in trade policy on the part of
                        other countries becomes effective, it would seem reasonable to expect that
                        competitive pressures will build up that will be prejudicial to American
                        businessmen, and it seems almost inevitable that in due course the United
                        States will have to take a second look at its unilateral policy.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday, in his press conference, the President took publicly in forthright
                        fashion the viewpoint which many of us have heard him express privately,
                        namely that he himself favored liberalization of our trade with Communist
                        China, since trade “can be used as a very great instrument of Government
                            policy”.<note n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">For text of the President’s news

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> referred to the fact
                        that he sent Paris a recommendation in strongest terms that the French
                        Government support the Compromise Plan A in the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss> discussions of China trade controls. He had based his
                        recommendation in large part upon the fact that failure by France to reach a
                        compromise settlement with the United States would have grave repercussions
                        within the United States. He said that contrary to his prediction, the
                        Congressional reaction to the outcome of the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                            >CHINCOM</gloss> negotiations had been mild and the President’s comments
                        on the subject were likewise temperate and conciliatory. He said that under
                        these circumstances some question might be raised as to the accuracy of his
                        judgment.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the President’s
                        remarks appeared to reflect his philosophy with respect to trade with the
                        Soviet bloc and were not at variance with comments which he has made
                        publicly on previous occasions. For instance, he has commented previously on
                        the problem posed for Japan by continued restrictions on Japanese trade with
                        Communist China. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that
                        apart from the general philosophy of the President’s comments, he knew that
                        the President had attached great importance to reaching an agreement if at
                        all possible on a continued differential trade control towards Communist
                        China. Since such an agreement had not been concluded, the President
                        naturally attaches importance to maintaining a united front on the part of
                        the cooperating countries, and presumably made his comments in an effort to

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said that his
                        recommendation had been turned down by the French Government, and that
                        although he was not fully informed on latest developments, he believed that
                        the <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0509"/>French would have little choice
                        but to follow the British lead. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said that of course this was a decision that each
                        government would have to make for itself and that we realized as a practical
                        matter the difficulty which individual governments would face in attempting
                        to deny exports to Communist China which were being permitted by the United
                        Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> referred to a proposal
                        which had been informally advanced by an officer in the French Foreign
                        Office to a member of the United States Embassy in Paris to the effect that
                        the French were considering submitting to <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> a proposal for (1) annual review of the <gloss

                        control system would remain in force only for a year at a time on the
                        understanding that the controls would lapse if unanimity were broken by the
                        decision of a participating country to denounce the agreement. (Embassy

                        proposal would raise some serious problems. He urged that the French plan to
                        discuss the details bilaterally with us and with other interested
                        governments before putting any such sweeping proposals into the China

                                how complicated it is and he thinks relying on trade too much to
                                hurt China is futile. He did not know it is an executive order
                                prohibiting trade with Red China rather than a law. If it comes up,

                            intention of certain of our Allies to reduce or abolish meaningful
                            controls on trade with the Sino-Soviet Bloc. The recent <gloss

                            demonstrated clearly a trend on the part of most participating countries

                            control question to purely commercial and political considerations. The

                            the USSR and her European satellites may be next on the calendar of

                    <p>The Committee examined the problem taking into account the
                        economic/industrial, political (domestic and foreign), military and
                        psychological factors involved. From an overall standpoint the Committee
                        concluded:</p>
                    <p>There would be no significant advantage economic or otherwise to the United
                        States in relaxing its total embargo policy. While the abolition of the
                        China differential by our principal allies has made the United States
                        embargo less effective than previously, that embargo still has some
                        retarding effect on the Communist Chinese military/industrial build-up.
                        Furthermore, the Committee is convinced that relaxation of the U.S. embargo
                        would have far reaching political and psychological repercussions, which
                        would seriously undermine our position in the Far East. The Committee has,
                        accordingly, reached the conclusion that the only wise course is to retain
                        our present controls. Additionally, the Committee concluded with respect to
                        each of the factors as follows: <list>

                                        and Communist China. Exports would probably range between 40
                                        million and 75 million dollars annually while imports into
                                        the United States from Communist China would probably be
                                        somewhat higher but not substantially so. It was recognized

                                        that market might create serious barriers to future

                                    <item>From the overall economic standpoint there would be on a
                                        short term basis, only limited effect on the Communist
                                        Chinese economy, either from maintenance of complete embargo
                                        on trade or relaxation to the current multilateral level.
                                        However, from the industrial standpoint the maintenance of
                                        the U.S. total embargo is effective in retarding Communist
                                        Chinese industrial growth to the extent it denies them
                                        foreign exchange, limits their sources for goods in short
                                        supply and denies them items in which the U.S. has a total
                                        monopoly of production, production know-how or technology.
                                        With respect to the last named category, U.S. controls are
                                        effective only in so far as they are administered in a way
                                        to prevent frustration by other countries to which such
                                        commodities, production know-how and technology are
                                        permitted to go. The Committee recognized that the
                                        effectiveness of the U.S. total embargo controls on trade
                                        had been diminished by the recent abolition of the China
                                        differential controls but considered an economic defense
                                        advantage still accruing from their continuation.</item>

                        subject (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704/2).</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> expressed the opinion that
                        the Council would find the report a rather conventional one—business as
                        usual. After describing the process by which the revised policy had been
                        formulated, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> went on to
                        point out that the only real change from the previous policy on this subject
                            (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704/1) consisted of a recognition
                        of the fact that multilateral controls on trade with Communist China had
                        disappeared. Accordingly, the new policy suggests that in place of the
                        vanished <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> policy, the United
                        States should engage in bilateral negotiations with other countries in order
                        to try to maintain something of a differential on Free World trade with
                        Communist China as opposed to such trade with the European Soviet bloc. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> believed that the fruits
                        of such bilateral negotiations were largely a pious hope. As for unilateral
                        U.S. controls on trade, etc., with Communist China, the policy directs that
                        we continue our complete embargo on trade with Communist China.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the questions asked by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as set
                        forth in Annex A to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704/2, the document
                        includes one new sentence. No sanctions are to be applied by the United
                        States against our allies for what they have done in the past with regard to
                        eliminating special Chinese trade controls. This does not necessarily <pb
                            n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0524"/>preclude the possible application
                        of sanctions for future actions by our allies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> then stated that <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704/2 clearly represented the consensus of
                        the members of the Council on Foreign Economic Policy. As a “good chairman”
                        of the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> stated that he went along with the
                        consensus of the group. Nevertheless, he stressed his personal feeling that
                        the continued maintenance of U.S. unilateral controls on U.S. trade with
                        Communist China made very little sense. In the first place, this practice
                        was unfair to U.S. businessmen, who were thus penalized in their competition
                        with foreign businessmen. Beyond this, the continuation of U.S. unilateral
                        controls had the effect of giving Russia a gift by throwing so much of
                        future trade with Communist China into the hands of the Soviet bloc. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> also stated his belief
                        that questions of trade were readily separable from such political questions
                        as the recognition of Communist China by the United States or the admission
                        of Communist China to the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then called on Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> for his views. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that all he had to
                        say was this: Many of our relationships with the Soviet-Chinese Communist
                        bloc countries have had to take into account not only the direct U.S.
                        relationship with the bloc, but also the impact of what the United States
                        does vis-à-vis the Communist powers on what might be called our weaker
                        brethren. It is proving a very difficult political task to prevent Communist
                        penetration of some of our allies in the Far East, such as Burma, Thailand,
                        Vietnam, etc., etc. If the world consisted just of the United States and the
                        USSR, and the United States alone had to deal with the USSR, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he would find himself
                        in agreement with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>’s
                        personal views as just expressed. This, however, was, of course, not the
                        case. After all, the Chinese Communists have consistently violated all
                        decent standards of civilized intercourse. This fact doesn’t hurt us, but it
                        may hurt other friendly nations. We want very much to maintain a
                        non-Communist area between us and Communist China, just as we have succeeded
                        in maintaining such an area in the West between us and the USSR itself. We
                        are holding on to this non-Communist area in Asia only with great
                        difficulty, and that area consists of rather small fragments—Japan, Formosa,
                        the Philippines, Southeast Asia, etc., etc. Thus the area constituted an
                        insular position. Nevertheless, it would be a great disaster if these
                        nations were to be taken over by the Communist Chinese and if, thus, the
                        whole Western Pacific area were to fall into the hands of the Communists. It
                        is such considerations as these which, said Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, made him doubtful of the wisdom of
                        cutting down on our unilateral controls on U.S. trade with Communist
                        China.</p>
                    <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0525"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then asked for an expression
                        of opinion from the Acting Secretary of Commerce. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WW1">Williams</persName> pointed out that the mere fact that
                        the Council had just heard these two statements of Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> on the problem of trade with
                        Communist China, indicated how difficult it had been to find the solution to
                        the problem set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704/2. There
                        were obviously strong arguments on both sides, but Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WW1">Williams</persName> thought, in a word, that the
                        unanimous finding of the Council on Foreign Economic Policy indicated that
                        we were living in a rapidly-changing world. It might well prove true that we
                        will eventually be obliged to change our own policy of a complete embargo on
                        trade with Communist China; but as of now it was the studied opinion of the
                            <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> that we should continue our
                        existing system of strict unilateral controls. The economic advantages of
                        such a course of action had not been a very difficult matter because our
                        trade with Communist China would not be likely to be very great even if the
                        controls were removed. Similarly, there had been no great argument about the
                        matter from the military point of view. The two fields which had been most
                        decisive in inducing the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> to recommend
                        continuation of the U.S. unilateral controls had been the political and the
                        psychological. Although all factors had been weighed in the <gloss
                            target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>’s deliberations, these last two were the
                        determining factors.</p>
                    <p>Asked for his views by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied that he
                        would say that his personal views on this matter were closer to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>’s than Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> thought. However, the military
                        people in the Department of Defense were still so acutely conscious of the
                        Korean war and of the bitter hostility of the Chinese Communists, that they
                        said, in effect, that we don’t want to trade with the dirty s.o.b.’s, nor do
                        we want the Free World nations to trade with them either. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> added that he himself was
                        rather worried lest it should prove that the United States is paying in part
                        for goods shipped to Communist China by our allies. But likewise, said
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, he was conscious of
                        the fact that some of these allied nations are almost obliged to trade with
                        mainland Asia—Japan, for instance. Undoubtedly, as Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> had said, trade properly handled
                        does contribute to world peace. The Russians were, after all, the main
                        devils, and by our present trade policies we are forcing Communist China to
                        continue to depend on the Soviet Union. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> doubted the wisdom of such a
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> asked General Lemnitzer, who
                        was acting for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, if the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff were satisfied with the answers to their questions. General
                        Lemnitzer explained that the reason why the Joint Chiefs had originally
                        submitted these questions was their anxiety over the erosion of our <pb
                            n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0526"/>security position. However, they
                        realized the cogency of other considerations and, accordingly, had concurred
                        in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704/2.</p>
                    <p>When called on by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> said he wished to
                        support strongly the views just expressed by the Secretary of State, whose
                        opinions did not always receive the understanding that they deserved to
                        have. If the United States weakened in its support of Nationalist China
                        against Communist China, lesser powers were sure to give way rapidly.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President expressed the opinion that the discussion of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704/2 led to one clear conclusion—namely,
                        that the matter of trade with Communist China was primarily a political
                        problem rather than an economic problem. He believed that we had no
                        alternative but to accept the position of the Secretary of State, for the
                        reason that the United States has to consider not only what it would do if
                        it were acting alone, but also the effect of our action on other powers. So
                        at this time, at least, it seemed to The Vice President that the policy set
                        forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704/2 was the most reasonable
                        policy we could envisage.</p>

                            security of the Free World posed by the Sino-Soviet bloc warrant the
                            application against that bloc of such economic defense measures by the
                            United States and by the Free World as will retard the growth of the war
                            potential of the bloc and reduce its unity. Our attitude and program
                            must be one which will not increase the possibility of war, but rather
                            one which will keep open paths which might lead to a sounder basis for
                            peace. During this period, the courses we take should be based upon the
                            assumption that interference in the trade between the Free World and the
                            Sino-Soviet bloc should take place only where a clear advantage to the
                            Free World would accrue from such interference. They should also be
                            based upon the assumption that the maintenance of personal, cultural,
                            and commercial contacts between the Free World and the European Soviet
                            bloc may have positive advantages during this period of tension and
                            watchfulness.</item>

                            full recognition of the fact that the economic defense system of the
                            Free World is part of the larger system of military and political
                            alliances and, like them, depends upon the cooperative efforts of the
                            free nations. The United States should participate in Free-World
                            collective arrangements in the field of trade controls. Accordingly, in
                            determining the economic defense measures which the United States should
                            adopt and those to be urged on other nations, the impact upon the
                            existing system of economic defense as a whole, and upon the Free-World
                            military and political alliances, should be taken into account.
                            Similarly, in multilateral military and political discussions,
                            consideration should be given to the impact of their courses of action
                            upon and support to be derived from the economic defense program.

                            individual countries, may make substantial intensification of

                    <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> opened the
                        discussion by noting that the difficulty with copper wire control was that
                        Rhodesia had to dispose of its copper output. He referred to the U.S.
                        proposal of June 19, 1957 that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> join
                        the U.S. in making a joint proposal in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> to restore copper wire to the embargo list for the Soviet
                            bloc.<note n="2" xml:id="d190fn2">Not further identified.</note> He said
                        he regretted that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> could not agree to
                        take the action requested by the United States. He said that in the view of
                        the British Government, we need at this stage a complete reexamination <pb
                            n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0531"/>of what the strategic controls
                        consist of and what our objectives should be in respect thereto. It was the
                        British view that a comprehensive and up-to-date set of principles should be
                        worked out as a basis for examining the need to embargo copper wire as well
                        as other items on the International List.</p>
                    <p>As far as copper wire is concerned, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1"
                            >Lloyd</persName> said that he was under continuing pressure from other
                        Ministers to permit the export of wire. The best he could offer under the
                        circumstances was the limitation of copper wire exports during the first six
                        months of 1958 to 30,000 tons which was approximately equivalent to the rate
                        of export during the last twelve-month period. (Note: The <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> exported 51,000 metric tons of copper wire
                        in 1956 and has been exporting during 1957 at the rate of 55,000 to 60,000
                        tons annually.) He regretted that an accommodation to U.S. views was not
                        possible, but the British position represented a Cabinet decision.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said the United States
                        argument in favor of embargoing copper wire appeared to hold that since the
                        Soviet bloc was short of copper, the Soviets had to make withdrawals from
                        the copper stockpile to meet their essential requirements. The British, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said, were prepared to
                        concede that such an estimate may be accurate, but they were not disposed to
                        think that the size of the Soviet stockpile mattered particularly, since a
                        war, if it came, would be over so soon that neither the necessity nor the
                        opportunity to draw on a stockpile would arise. Under these circumstances,
                        he said, the British looked at the copper wire question as a trade matter.
                        From their standpoint, the critical question was one of assisting the
                        Rhodesian economy and to some extent that of the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> recalled that the British
                        and American defense and intelligence experts had met in London in March,
                        1957 to discuss the Soviet bloc supply situation with respect to
                            copper.<note n="3" xml:id="d190fn3">Documentation on these talks is in
                            Department of State, Central File 461.419.</note> Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_CSH1">Caccia</persName> said that the need now was rather
                        for a discussion of criteria. He felt the copper wire question was really
                        illustrative of a problem which we had started to look at in the Middle East
                        context—namely, major foreign exchange earning products which certain
                        countries are unable to get rid of, such as cotton, apples, or in the case
                        of Rhodesia, copper.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> noted that in the matter
                        of the Soviet copper stockpile, the March consultation between the British
                        and American experts found that the significant point was the Soviet
                        inability to meet its stockpile needs which affected direct military
                        requirements. The Secretary read from the conclusion of the joint US/<gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> report of March, 1957<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d190fn4">Not found in Department of State files.</note> which
                        stated that there was in 1956 a shortfall of <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500"
                            facs="0532"/>220,000 tons of copper in the Soviet bloc, consisting of
                        50,000 tons in the civilian economy, the probable withdrawal of 35,000 tons
                        from the strategic stockpile, and the failure to add 135,000 tons to it. He
                        said that while the situation may have changed from that prevailing when the
                        study was completed six months ago, the facts were sound. The Secretary said
                        the points raised by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> were of a
                        general character—whether it was more important to help their own economy or
                        to keep the copper wire from the Russians.</p>
                    <p>With respect to stockpiling, the Secretary noted that we are stockpiling on
                        the basis of a five-year war. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1"
                            >Lloyd</persName> said it was a question of what kind of war we think
                        will be waged. He said that when he was Minister of Supply, the principle
                        which was applied was not to let the other side get anything which would
                        make their economy very much more efficient. The question now was whether
                        the objective of holding down the Soviet copper stockpile was a sufficient
                        reason to penalize the economy of the United Kingdom and of Rhodesia.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary inquired how the British would propose to go about a re-study
                        of the strategic concepts of the control system. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said the United Kingdom regarded it as
                        a Board of Trade matter. He presumed a working group would be in order,
                        similar to the arrangement in 1954 when the previous review was undertaken
                        with <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Harold Stassen</persName> representing the
                        United States. The Secretary said that the British seemed now to be posing
                        questions which could not very well be handled by an essentially technical
                        group. The proposal which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>
                        had made was for new criteria. It was not clear how such criteria should be
                        framed. One possible criterion might be to keep from the Soviet bloc
                        advanced types of machinery. With respect to the category of wire, there was
                        the criterion of hindering the Soviet construction of a system of secure
                        land-line communication.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that someone should
                        identify the nature of the criteria problem and identify the correct
                        objectives for present conditions. The Secretary said that this was not easy
                        to accomplish since the Board of Trade view will probably differ from the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> military view, which probably
                        coincides with the military view in Washington.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested that the trade
                        control program as presently constituted works at cross purposes with policy
                        on exchanges. He said that the denial of fast merchant ships to the Soviet
                        Union seemed at odds with a policy on other forms of exchange which assumed
                        that the more the Soviets see of us, the more difficulty they will have at
                        home.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary acknowledged that to some extent we may be working at
                        contradictory purposes. He said it seemed proper for the <pb n="501"
                            xml:id="pg_501" facs="0533"/>Prime Minister to raise this question in
                        his talks. He said he would not wish to make any decision immediately on Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s proposal without having an
                        opportunity to discuss it with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName>. He said he would also like to look into the matter
                        of the existing criteria and the American attitude thereon.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary reverted to the copper wire question after Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> joined the discussion, noting that
                        the copper market is pretty dead now with serious effects upon the Rhodesian
                        economy, and that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> had asked
                        for a review of the criteria for the strategic lists.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that copper is one of
                        the few major raw materials in which the Soviets are deficient and thus one
                        of the few items whose embargo is likely to have a serious effect on the
                        Soviet war machine. It might, of course, be appropriate to examine the lists
                        again to see whether the items are of the same strategic importance as they
                        were three years ago.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> inquired whether a fat or a
                        thin man was more likely to attack one. He said that with respect to
                        cultural contacts, we have come to the conclusion that the more the Russians
                        see of us and the more frequently they leave the Soviet bloc, the better. He
                        said the recent Youth Festival<note n="5" xml:id="d190fn5">The World Youth
                            Festival, sponsored by the Young Communist League, was held in Moscow in
                            August.</note> demonstrated that the West was gaining through contacts.
                        A rising standard of living was likely to make people somewhat more fond of
                        eating well and somewhat less belligerent. He felt it was time that we
                        rethink our philosophy of trade controls.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSH1">Caccia</persName> noted that if we
                        retain a tough control system, we will have to decide what to do about
                        problems such as Rhodesia.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary suggested that if copper wire goes to the bloc, there seems
                        little purpose in keeping other forms of copper on the list. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> endorsed this point, recalling that
                        the bloc has been importing more wire than they are using as wire. He said
                        he could not answer Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s basic
                        question, since the effect of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1"
                            >Lloyd</persName>’s proposal would be to reverse our accepted plan of
                        putting a strain on the Soviet economy and would substitute the philosophy
                        that if the Russians become fat and happy, they will become soft. He said
                        that if this theory were accepted, it would affect the entire <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> list.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had
                        commented last week that this cultural exchange is all right, but what we
                        really need is to get away from all these economic restrictions and
                        embargoes. The Secretary said he had never been clear whether the Soviets
                        object to the <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0534"/>restrictions because
                        they really hurt them economically or because they only hurt their national
                        pride.</p>

                        Minister Thorold referred to an earlier conversation between <persName

                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> the attached third-person secret
                        note on the control of copper wire. He stressed the importance to Rhodesia
                        of export outlets for copper.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the British
                        proposal raises a basic question to which our Government must give careful
                        study. We had, he said, been considering the advisability of a review of the
                            <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">Cocom</gloss> lists in the light of existing
                        criteria but the British proposal implied a fundamental change in criteria.
                        Whereas strategic controls heretofore have been based on the assumption that
                        the West should cut down USSR availabilities of copper which is used for
                        civilian as well as military purposes, the British proposal is based on the

                        <p rend="center">CONTROL OF COPPER WIRE</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s Government have given careful thought to the views
                            expressed in the Memorandum of the United States Government <pb n="503"
                                xml:id="pg_503" facs="0535"/>of the 20th of June, 1957, on the
                            control of the exports of copper wire to the Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>This matter is of considerable importance to the United Kingdom both for
                            her own economy and because of her Commonwealth interests. In
                            particular, trade in copper is of great importance to the Federation of
                            Rhodesia and Nyasaland, more especially as the market price of raw
                            copper has fallen by more than half in the last eighteen months (from
                            £437 to under £200 per ton) and has for some time stood below the level
                            to which the Rhodesian budget is geared.</p>
                        <p>It is apparent that, whilst both Governments agree on the importance of
                            maintaining strategic controls for as long as they are shown to be
                            necessary, there is a difference of opinion on the applicability of the
                            criteria by which materials are judged to have sufficient strategic
                            value to justify an embargo on their export to the Sino-Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>In the opinion of Her Majesty’s Government, the existing strategic
                            criteria, under which a wide range of goods and materials is subject to
                            embargo, do not accord with the lines of current <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategic thinking and planning
                            assumptions. In their view, the time has come for a review of these
                            criteria with the object of modifying them to accord with the
                            requirements of current strategic planning. In the light of the outcome
                            of this review both Governments could determine for which goods and
                            materials an embargo was, in their opinion, now justified. An
                            appropriate recommendation could thereafter be submitted to the
                            Coordinating Committee.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s Government propose, therefore, that discussions should be
                            held by experts of the United States and United Kingdom Governments, to
                            review the current criteria for the maintenance of strategic controls.
                            It would then be possible on the new basis thus provided to prepare new
                            lists of embargoed items for the consideration of the two
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, in order to meet as far as they can the interest of the
                            United States in the matter of the control of copper wire exports, Her
                            Majesty’s Government have decided that they will restrict their
                            licensing of exports of bare copper wire to the Soviet bloc, in the six
                            months period commencing on the 1st of January, 1958, to a limit of
                            30,000 tons.</p>
                        <p>If the United States Government find themselves able to accept the
                            proposal for discussions now put forward, Her Majesty’s Government will
                            be glad to consider their suggestions for a suitable time and place.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Thorold</persName> called to leave the attached memorandum
                        entitled “Revision of the Strategic Criteria”.<note n="2" xml:id="d192fn2"
                            >This memorandum, not printed, proposed that the United States and the
                            United Kingdom undertake a review of the strategic criteria on which the
                            embargo lists were based and recommended new criteria for determining
                            strategic materials.</note> He said he did not propose to discuss the
                        substance of the memorandum but rather to deal with certain procedural
                        suggestions. He said the British envisaged two stages in the bilateral
                        discussions. The first stage would consist of a discussion of the criteria
                        with a view to reaching agreement on them. After such agreement had been
                        reached, the British assumed that there would be an interval of several
                        weeks during which the two sides would apply the criteria to the lists. At
                        the end of this period, there would be a second stage of bilateral
                        discussion in which agreement would be sought on a specific list proposal
                        which might be presented to the Consultative Group. As noted in the
                        memorandum, the British were thinking in terms of one embargo list to
                        replace the present International Lists I, II and III, and a separate
                        examination of the munitions and atomic energy lists.</p>
                    <p>With respect to timing, Mr. <persName>Thorold</persName> suggested that the
                        first stage of discussion on the criteria should be held as soon as the
                        United States had had a chance to study the British proposals. He said that
                        London has suggested that the first stage bilaterals take place here in
                        Washington and the second stage of discussion on the lists in London. He
                        said that the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> situation was likely
                        to provide some pressure with respect to the timing problem. He referred to
                        the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> discussion scheduled for January
                        3 on the French proposal for a List I review and said the United Kingdom
                        intended to take the line that in principle the re-examination of the lists
                        was in order, that the individual member countries should draw up proposals,
                        and that the committee should think in terms of <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505"
                            facs="0537"/>scheduling a subsequent discussion at a later stage. He
                        hoped that the United States would take a similar line, and referred to his
                        understanding from Paris that such a position had been suggested by the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said he would give Mr.
                            <persName>Thorold</persName> a response to his two specific questions
                        and would give him further reactions and suggestions on the procedural
                        proposals early next week if possible. He referred to the strong military
                        aspect involved in the sort of discussion which was foreshadowed in the
                        British memorandum. Mr. <persName>Thorold</persName> said that the British
                        recognized this fact, and themselves proposed to bring over a Defense
                        Ministry official for the Washington discussions on criteria. It was
                        understood that there would be a further discussion between Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> and Mr. <persName>Thorold</persName>
                        to confirm procedural and tactical points before entering into substantive
                        discussions on the British memorandum.<note n="3" xml:id="d192fn3"><p>At the

                                revision in the criteria for trade controls … . Discussion turned
                                upon the value of <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> if there
                                was such a widely differing view as to its operation and the current
                                policy of the US to consult Lists 1 and 2, but not to limit it so
                                severely. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Robertson</persName>
                                discussed the difference between <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"

                                Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> felt that an
                                attempt should be made, although not relied heavily upon, to have
                                the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> military consult with our
                                military on the requirements, recognizing that the British military
                                would take orders from British civilian departments, notably the
                                Board of Trade. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> was

                        States Government believes that a Consultative Group meeting should be held
                        sometime in February to undertake a general reexamination of the entire
                        multilateral security trade control program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AWC1"
                            >Armstrong</persName> said that this proposal was consistent with the
                        French initiative in suggesting an early list review in <gloss

                        comprehensive examination of all elements of the control system by the
                        Consultative Group would more nearly respond to the needs of the

                    <p>Details of United States proposals would be communicated to the participating

                        preparation of views. The question of transmitting these detailed proposals,
                        whether bilaterally, or multilaterally in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"

                    <p>The foreign diplomats all welcomed the proposal for a Consultative Group
                        meeting. Several of the officers inquired whether the United States intends
                        to propose the abolition of List II, to which Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AWC1">Armstrong</persName> replied that the annual review of
                        List II quotas has been an element of discord, and we might have some ideas
                        to propose on this subject. The Canadian officer inquired whether the United
                        States intends to take any specific action with respect to China during the
                        meeting, to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AWC1">Armstrong</persName>
                        replied negatively, although pointing out that any vulnerability of the bloc
                        arising out of purely Chinese circumstances should be exploited. The Italian
                        officer commented, noting that his remark should not be given official
                        standing, that he had the impression that his Government <pb n="507"
                            xml:id="pg_507" facs="0539"/>believed that the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> participating countries should be cautious in proceeding
                        to any major revision of the International Lists.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese officers asked several pointed questions with respect to timing,
                        relating these questions to the attitudes of other countries, as for
                        example, France. They also asked about the level of the U.S. representation,
                        and inquired about U.S. expectations as to the degree of technical support
                        required for our delegation, indicating that they rather anticipated
                        protracted negotiations at some stage of the talks.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese officers then developed a line of questioning relating to the
                        possibility of expanded U.S.-Russian trade. It finally appeared that this
                        reflected a Japanese Foreign Office instruction which quoted a “Paris
                        Journal” article signed by Jacqueline Gunkovaty. The item, as reported by
                        the Japanese officers, stated that Russian Ambassador Zarubin had gained the
                        impression during the course of conversations with Ambassador
                            <persName>W.S.B. Lacy</persName> that the United States was actively
                        interested in increasing trade with Russia. Zarubin had therefore
                        recommended that his successor be a trade specialist. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AWPJ1">Armstrong</persName> commented that this was an
                        interesting bit of press speculation.</p>
                    <p>The next question was whether or not U.S.–<gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>
                        consultations were underway on this subject, to which Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AWPJ1">Armstrong</persName> replied that all <gloss

                        United Kingdom, were being informed of our proposals at the same time.<note

                        <p>The Embassy of is informed that the Government of the United States has
                            recently been reviewing the multilateral trade control program in the
                            light of current developments in the international scene. This review
                            suggests the desirability of a general reexamination of the
                            international controls for the purpose of making them as effective as
                            possible. For its part, the United States will shortly be prepared to
                            outline to other governments proposals which <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508"
                                facs="0540"/>will deal comprehensively with all elements of the
                            control system. Illustratively, the United States is considering
                            possible clarification of criteria, a re-examination of the
                            International Lists including consideration of the reduction or
                            elimination of quantitative controls, and a revision of certain of the
                            control procedures to simplify their application.</p>
                        <p>The United States has noted that other participating governments have
                            also expressed the view that a re-examination of the controls would be
                            timely. The French Delegate has proposed that on January 3, 1958 <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> set a date for beginning a revision
                            of the embargo list. Since it is considered that such a review should
                            not be approached on a partial basis in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> without consideration of other aspects of the
                            multilateral controls, the United States will propose that the
                            Consultative Group undertake a comprehensive review of the controls
                            along the lines indicated above. The United States considers that such a
                            meeting might be scheduled in February 1958. This Government’s proposals
                            will be communicated in detail to the participating governments
                            sufficiently in advance of a Consultative Group meeting to permit their
                            examination prior to multilateral discussion. It is hoped that other
                            participating governments will support the United States suggestion for
                            a full review of the multilateral controls in the Consultative Group and
                            will concur with the proposed timing of a meeting of this Group.</p>

                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> noted the work of the task force
                        and then stressed the need for keeping this paper confidential until
                        decisions were reached on what publicity would be given to it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> read in full
                        Recommendations 1 and 2 on regulation of natural gas. In discussion, the
                        President singled out the phrase that the Administration would recommend
                        that Congress should enact legislation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> believed the Executive Branch should take a
                        positive position on any bills taken up by Congress even though not
                        introduced by the Administration. The Attorney General believed the
                        Administration should limit itself to commenting on bills on which it is
                        called to testify. In subsequent discussion, it was made clear that the
                        Administration would not itself recommend legislation but would stand
                        prepared to testify on legislation which may be introduced by the
                        opposition. Under <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> suggested substitute language for
                        Recommendation 1 a, which had the effect of deleting the Administration
                        commitment and substituting a general policy statement on which legislative
                        initiative could be taken by anyone so desiring. The Vice President took
                        note of pressures on the Texas Senators particularly for such legislation
                        and suggested that the Administration should leave the initiative to <gloss
                            target="#t_Sen1">Sen.</gloss> Lyndon Johnson.</p>
                    <p>The President believed that any public statement should stress the need for
                        continued exploration in the long-range interest of the <pb n="510"
                            xml:id="pg_510" facs="0542"/>consumer, otherwise supplies may run short
                        and the price be increased far beyond the modest cost of continuing
                        exploration. Mrs. <persName>Hobby</persName> believed an entire preface
                        should be prepared for the purpose of establishing consumer interest as the
                        purpose of these policies.</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> asked whether these
                        policies would relieve from regulation by either Federal or state government
                        any activity presently regulated. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> indicated that there would be such an activity,
                        which was now being regulated by virtue of the Supreme Court decision on the
                        Phillips case. The Attorney General pointed out that it would be subject to
                        state regulation if the states desire to do so. Mr.
                            <persName>Brownlee</persName> noted that most State Power Authorities
                        would be unhappy with this policy since they would believe it did not
                        effectively control the price of gas to consumers in their states.</p>

                            >Mitchell</persName> noted that Paragraph 1a, (2), was not entirely

                            >Humphrey</persName> suggested that the final clause (“because Federal
                        jurisdiction, etc.”) should be knocked out. It was so agreed.</p>
                    <p>Recommendation 3 was accepted without comment.</p>
                    <p>In regard to Recommendation 4 on oil imports, Under <gloss target="#t_Sec1"
                            >Sec</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> emphasized
                        the desirability of voluntary controls as the best means of accomplishing
                        the State Department’s very difficult problems involving friendly countries;
                        the Attorney General cautioned, in the interests of the anti-trust laws,
                        that any discussions by Government officials with officials of private oil
                        companies must be limited to merely pointing out the consequences of failure
                        to limit imports voluntarily; <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> forecast that voluntary action
                        would eventually be ineffective because of increasingly bad situations in
                        domestic energy industries, but he agreed that the recommendation here was
                        the best now available; <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> cautioned against any rapid changes
                        toward over-reliance on foreign oil, though he did believe it might be
                        better to slow down on the use of our own exhaustible oil resources. The
                        President believed the policy to be the best “middle of the road” solution.
                        Mrs. <persName>Hobby</persName> wished to soften the language committing the
                        President to propose appropriate action, and to substitute the word
                        “review”. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> and the President
                        believed a mere promise of review would be inadequate to the present
                        situation. <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> suggested a revision to state that the President will
                        propose appropriate action, deleting the final clause. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> agreed.</p>

                        in this recommendation. He believed inclusion constituted a limitation upon
                        the ability of private concerns to improve their efficiency by converting
                        from one form of fuel to another. He believed some alternative program
                        should be found for helping the coal industry.</p>

                    <p>The President believed he did not have sufficient information on which to

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> again cautioned on the
                        need for avoiding any public indication of this policy until the Department
                        of State had ample opportunity to effect necessary discussions with foreign
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Recommendations 5 through 8 were accepted without discussion.</p>
                    <p>On Recommendation 9, <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> noted the relationship to the work of
                        the Transport Policy Committee and asked that this section be held in
                        abeyance until his Committee completed its work. He did not foresee any
                        conflict. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> agreed to work
                        out with him the appropriate handling of this particular point.</p>
                    <p>Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> opposed Recommendation 12, j, on the
                        grounds that it would open the door to innumerable pressures for similar
                        action for any product in a depressed situation, for discrimination favoring
                        one item over another depending on political influence, and other abuses.
                            <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_WS1"
                            >Weeks</persName> asserted the policy would not increase the quantity of
                        coal used but would increase its cost. The President believed the situation
                        would not differ from similar practices such as tariffs and quotas. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> suggested that there would
                        not be a great increase in the need for coal in any future war. In the
                        ensuing discussion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>
                        apparently made the more convincing case for a considerably increased use.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> also believed this
                        proposal did not involve any new principle of Federal action to protect an
                        industry necessary to mobilization and national security. The President
                        concluded that this policy would of course have to be administered on the
                        basis of good judgment.</p>
                    <p>In a discussion as to publicity on the paper as a whole (except for the part
                        on natural gas already decided), the President emphasized the need for
                        obtaining the views of people expert in their knowledge of Congressional
                        viewpoint. Gov. <persName>Adams</persName> spoke on the need for an early
                        public statement. It was agreed that the Committee would therefore take the
                        report back in order to prepare recommendations on publication, to be
                        cleared with Cabinet members and, if possible, submitted to the White House
                        for discussion at the Legislative Leaders Conference next Tuesday. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> announced that the
                        Cabinet Committee would have a 9:00 A.M. meeting on Saturday, January
                        22nd.</p>

                    <p>The importance of energy to a strong and growing economy is clear. As
                        conditions of supplies and reserves of coal, oil and natural gas change and
                        as both defense and peacetime requirements come more clearly into focus, the
                        bearing of Government policies upon energy needs re-examination.</p>
                    <p>What degree and kind of public regulation is appropriate to the present
                        situation and future outlook? What trade policies for energy supplies will
                        most effectively express the overlapping national needs for adequate
                        protectable supplies in case of war and for encouragement of economic growth
                        of this country and friendly countries elsewhere in the world? What steps
                        may be taken to improve the economic position of the coal industry, now
                        seriously depressed, without penalizing competing industries, as a means of
                        enhancing the ability of that industry to contribute to the national
                        defense? More particularly, should specific changes be made in tax, freight
                        rate, research, government purchasing, or other policies in the energy
                        field?</p>
                    <p>These and other policy questions press for careful review and decision.</p>
                    <p>On July 30, 1954, the President established a Cabinet Committee on Energy
                        Supplies and Resources Policy. The Director of the Office of Defense
                        Mobilization was designated as Chairman of this Committee and the heads of
                        the following agencies served as members: Departments of State, Treasury,
                        Defense, Justice, the Interior, Commerce and Labor.</p>
                    <p>The White House directive respecting the Committee’s assignment included the
                        following specific statements: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“At the direction of the President the Committee will undertake a
                                study to evaluate all factors pertaining to the continued

                                supplies and resources fuels in the United States, with the aim of
                                strengthening the national defense, providing orderly industrial
                                growth, and assuring supplies for our expanding national economy and
                                for any future emergency.</p>
                            <p>“The Committee will review factors affecting the requirements and
                                supplies of the major sources of energy including: coal (anthracite,
                                bituminous and lignite, as well as coke, coal tars, and synthetic
                                liquid fuels); petroleum and natural gas.”</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The Cabinet Committee has been aided greatly by an able and representative
                        Task Force appointed pursuant to the President’s instructions. The
                        Committee’s recommendations are set forth below.</p>
                    <p rend="center">RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">1. Natural Gas Regulation</hi></p>
                    <p>We believe the problem of natural gas regulation should be approached from
                        the viewpoint of assuring adequate supplies and the discovery and
                        development of additional reserves to support such supplies, in the
                        interests of national defense, an expanding domestic economy, and reasonable
                        prices to consumers.</p>
                    <p>To secure these objectives, it is essential to give due consideration to (1)
                        the operations known as the production of natural gas, (2) the
                        transportation of gas in interstate transmission lines, and (3) the
                        distribution of gas in municipalities. Individual companies may engage in
                        more than one of these activities. Each operation of such companies should
                        be treated by like criteria according to its appropriate industry
                        function.</p>
                    <p>In the production of natural gas it is important that sound conservation
                        practices be continued. This area of conservation management is under the
                        jurisdiction of State conservation commissions. In the interest of a sound
                        fuels policy and the protection of the national defense and consumer
                        interests, in assuring such a continued exploration for and development of
                        adequate reserves as to provide an adequate supply of natural gas, we
                        believe the Federal Government should not control the production, gathering,
                        processing or sale of natural gas prior to its entry into an interstate
                        transmission line.</p>
                    <p>The interstate transmission of natural gas by interstate transmission lines,
                        and the subsequent sale of such gas for resale is a public utility function
                        and should be under the regulation of the Federal Power Commission. In
                        considering the certification of new lines and applications for increased
                        rates based on new or re-negotiated purchase contracts, the Commission
                        should consider not only the assurance of supply, but also whether the
                        contract prices of the natural gas which the applicant has contracted to buy
                        are the reasonable market field prices.</p>
                    <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0546"/>
                    <p>The several states or their political sub-divisions should continue to
                        provide the public utility regulation of distributing companies in
                        accordance with usual utility practices.</p>
                    <p>Thus the complete cycle of natural gas production, transmission and
                        utilization will be appropriately regulated: the production and conservation
                        of natural gas by the State conservation commissions; the interstate
                        transmission of natural gas by the Federal Power Commission; and the
                        distribution by the local public utility commissions.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Sales Below Cost by Interstate Pipeline
                            Companies</hi></p>
                    <p>The basic principle regarding the regulation of natural gas and the use of
                        alternative energy sources should be as far as possible that of free choice
                        by the consumer and free and fair competition among suppliers. This, it is
                        confidently thought, will provide most effectively for the assurance and
                        flexibility of energy supply, both for economic growth and strong security
                        readiness. But sales either for resale or direct consumption below actual
                        cost plus a fair proportion of fixed charges which drive out competing fuels
                        constitute unfair competition and are inimical to a sound fuels economy.</p>
                    <p>The Committee recommends, therefore, that legislation be proposed that will
                        prohibit sales by interstate pipelines either for resale or for direct
                        consumption, which drive out competing fuels because the charges are below
                        actual cost plus a fair proportion of fixed charges.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. Eminent Domain for Natural Gas
                            Storage</hi></p>
                    <p>The power of eminent domain for the acquisition of surface and mineral rights
                        for the development of underground storage reservoirs should be granted
                        subject to appropriate safeguards to protect the public safety, including
                        the mining industry.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">4. Crude Oil Imports and Residual Fuel Oil
                            Imports</hi></p>
                    <p>An expanding domestic oil industry, plus a healthy oil industry in friendly
                        countries which help to supply the United States market, constitute
                        basically important elements in the kind of industrial strength which
                        contributes most to a strong national defense. Other energy industries,
                        especially coal, must also maintain a level of operation which will make
                        possible rapid expansion in output should that become necessary. In this
                        complex picture both domestic production and imports have important parts to
                        play; neither should be sacrificed to the other.</p>
                    <p>Since World War II importation of crude oil and residual fuel oil into the
                        United States has increased substantially, with the result <pb n="515"
                            xml:id="pg_515" facs="0547"/>that today these oils supply a significant
                        part of the U.S. market for fuels.</p>
                    <p>The Committee believes that if the imports of crude and residual oils should
                        exceed significantly the respective proportions that these imports of oils
                        bore to the production of domestic crude oil in 1954, the domestic fuels
                        situation could be so impaired as to endanger the orderly industrial growth
                        which assures the military and civilian supplies and reserves that are
                        necessary to the national defense.</p>
                    <p>In view of the foregoing, the Committee concludes that in the interest of
                        national defense imports should be limited. It is highly desirable that this
                        be done by voluntary, individual action of those who are importing or those
                        who become importers of crude or residual oil. The Committee believes that
                        every effort should be made and will be made to avoid the necessity of
                        governmental intervention.</p>
                    <p>The Committee recommends, however, that if in the future the imports of crude
                        oil and residual fuel oils exceed significantly the respective proportions
                        that such imported oils bore to domestic production of crude oil in 1954,
                        appropriate action should be taken.</p>
                    <p>The Committee recommends further that the desirable proportionate
                        relationships between imports and domestic production be reviewed from time
                        to time in the light of industrial expansion and changing economic and
                        national defense requirements.</p>
                    <p>In arriving at these conclusions and recommendations, the Committee has taken
                        into consideration the importance to the economies of friendly countries of
                        their oil exports to the United States as well as the importance to the
                        United States of the accessibility of foreign oil supplies both in peace and
                        war.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">5. Petroleum Refining Capacity</hi></p>
                    <p>The Departments of Defense and the Interior should have studies made by their

                        These agreements prohibit the institution or maintenance of quotas or other
                        measures by any participating country which make effective prohibitions or
                        restrictions on imports. Two possible let-outs from this commitment are the
                        “escape” clause and the “security” exception clause in the two agreements.
                        So far as the “escape” clause is concerned, it is not believed—and the
                        sub-Cabinet Committee does not find—that imports are causing or threatening
                        to cause serious injury to domestic producers. So far as the “security”
                        exception is concerned, it would be difficult to make out a convincing <pb

                        since the “security” exception runs to everything in the trade agreements,
                        our action on this basis under existing circumstances would pave the way for
                        unraveling of all the commitments on the same basis by other countries
                        whenever they felt they had the color of a case, a tendency which so far has
                        not been pronounced.</p>
                    <p>The announcement by the Government of a policy of restriction would
                        undoubtedly be taken by our trading partners to be the institution or
                        maintenance of a restriction in violation of our commitment. We could try to
                        make a public case based on either of the above-mentioned let-outs. Whether
                        we succeeded or not, and it is doubtful that we would, the affected
                        countries would be privileged to withdraw compensatory concessions made to
                        us, or in the case of Venezuela, would have the right to terminate the
                        agreement as well. Under these circumstances, it would be far better, at the
                        time of announcing a policy, to state that appropriate consultations with
                        the affected countries with whom we have trade agreements will be held.
                        These consultations might lead to agreements on our part to compensatory
                        withdrawals of concessions by them. We might be able to avoid, if such an
                        announcement were made in the Committee’s recommendations, a disagreeable
                        public exhibition of charges and defense. A sentence at the end of paragraph

                            <p>“There has been a continuous fight between domestic producers and
                                importers over a period of at least 25 years, during which time
                                there have been a number of ups and downs. The problems of oil
                                imports flared up again in a serious form in 1954 and domestic
                                producers, joined by coal and labor, are making a determined effort
                                to secure restrictions. The output of the coal industry is depressed
                                from almost 700 million tons production annually shortly after the
                                war to less than 400 million tons. This is a matter of concern from
                                the standpoint of defense. If coal production drops to too low a
                                level mines are lost from premature abandonment, encroachment of
                                water, and other factors and there would need to be a substantial
                                increase in coal production in an emergency. We have been trying to
                                prevent the enactment of tariffs or the imposition of quotas in this
                                situation. It was only as a result of the establishment of the
                                Cabinet Committee on Energy Supplies and Resources Policy that
                                Congressional committees refrained from conducting investigations of
                                the whole problem at the last session of Congress. The Cabinet
                                Committee is going to say that imports should be kept at reasonable
                                levels by voluntary actions by the industry. There are two reasons
                                for the Government not intervening in the situation. One is because
                                of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and our trade agreements
                                and the other is the fact that the industry itself does not want any
                                kind of Government regulation.” (Memorandum of conversation,

                    <p>Current shortages in certain basic defense materials, specifically copper,
                        nickel, and aluminum have drawn the attention of the Congress. The Joint
                        Committee on Defense Production held hearings on March 10, at which Dr.

                        <head>COPPER</head>
                        <p>Copper was in easy supply a year ago. Huge unsold stocks, particularly of
                            Chilean origin, overhung the market and there were marked price
                            weaknesses in the commodity markets and curtailment of output throughout
                            the industry. In March 1954, the U.S., at Chile’s request, bought
                            100,000 tons of excess stocks for our stockpile. In the spring and
                            summer demand in the U.S. and Europe improved considerably. Production
                            could not be geared quickly enough to meet the rising demand, and
                            crippling strikes in the U.S. and Chile caused widespread shortages. A
                            strike in Rhodesia, in early 1955, contributed further to the tight
                            situation. Prices on the London Metal Exchange rose from 30 cents per
                            pound in July, 1954, to 45-1/8 cents on February 10, 1955. However, U.S.
                            producers held the line at 30 cents until the end of January, 1955, when
                            the U.S. price was increased to 33 cents. Because of the price
                            differential between the U.S. and Europe, copper that would normally
                            come to the U.S. has been attracted to Europe. Therefore, the shortages
                            in the U.S. are more severe than outside.</p>
                        <p>In the fourth quarter 1954 the U.S. acted to divert certain tonnages due
                            on stockpile contracts to consumers. The Government also sold copper
                            stocks accumulated under Defense Production Act contracts and from
                            current deliveries under those contracts. The total amount under
                            Government control delivered amounted to over 40,000 tons. At the same
                            time, restrictions were put on the export of copper from the U.S. In the
                            first quarter 1955 and applicable to February and March, export
                            restrictions were drastically tightened to cover all forms of copper and
                            copper scrap except that of foreign <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522"
                                facs="0554"/>origin. Recently further action was taken to release an
                            additional 8,000 tons of <gloss target="#t_DPA1">DPA</gloss> copper for
                            March and export controls were further tightened for the second quarter.
                            The restrictions on exports now represent about a 67 percent cut from
                            the rate prevailing in 1954. The severity of this cut has caused
                            hardship in countries normally dependent on the U.S. as a source of
                            supplies.</p>
                        <p>The Committee took up the movement of copper to the bloc countries as a
                            contributing factor to the general shortage. We explained that this was
                            not a major factor in the total situation and that we were discussing
                            with other countries a tightening of controls with a reasonable prospect
                            of success.</p>

                        <head>ALUMINUM</head>
                        <p>A severe shortage in aluminum has only recently come to light. This
                            shortage is occasioned by the high rate of industrial activity and
                            somewhat lower than expected rate of Canadian output. The shortage
                            situation is dramatized by the price of aluminum scrap which is
                            currently several cents over the price of virgin ingot.</p>
                        <p>In general, the Committee seemed to feel that the shortage situation
                            would be temporary. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>
                            explained that any indications that the present levels of demand would
                            be maintained or increased could, however, point to the need for
                            reopening consideration for further expansion in productive capacity.
                            Capacity has already been increased by 100 percent in the last five
                            years.</p>
                        <p>The aluminum industry has recently recommended the virtual elimination of
                            stockpile deliveries during 1955. During the first quarter <gloss
                                target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> deferred delivery of 50,000,000 pounds
                            to later in the year. The industry also recommended an embargo on scrap
                            exports. So far no action has been taken on these requests, although
                            action is pending. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>
                            told the Committee that any deferrals of delivery to the stockpile would
                            be limited to short periods of, say, two to three months.</p>
                        <p>Action on exports of scrap, coming closely after our controls over
                            copper, would seriously impair our relations with West Germany, the
                            principal buyer of aluminum scrap. Demand in that country has been
                            growing steadily and higher levels of production are depending in part
                            upon receiving materials from the U.S. We made the point that the U.S.
                            has an important interest in the development of the German economy and
                            that its raw materials requirements would grow further as that country
                            takes its place in the defense production program of the West.</p>

                        <head>NICKEL</head>
                        <p>There is a stubborn shortage in nickel which has persisted since before
                            Korea. Most countries retained controls over distribution and
                            consumption until the end of 1953. Since then general prosperity,
                            together with continuing defense production and stepped-up stockpiling
                            in the U.S., has continued heavy demands and accelerated the
                            shortage.</p>
                        <p>Approximately 85 percent of world production of nickel comes from the
                            Sudbury district of Canada and is principally produced by the
                            International Nickel Company. Cuba at present supplies about 7 percent,
                            New Caledonia 5 percent, and the remaining production is scattered.
                            Exclusive of stockpiling, the U.S. consumes 61 percent of the total
                            world production. Deliveries to the U.S. stockpile account for an
                            additional 25 percent of production. The stockpile program, therefore,
                            is a major contributing factor to the shortage as well as the largest
                            single impact on production. Moreover, knowledge that U.S. stockpiling
                            may be completed by 1958 or 1959 has caused a certain reluctance on the
                            part of private capital to aggressively search for new sources. In
                            recent years, much of the new production has come about through U.S.
                            Government assistance and is to a large extent noncompetitive under
                            ordinary commercial conditions.</p>
                        <p>Recently the U.S. released 1,000,000 pounds of nickel on stockpile
                            contracts to alleviate the current industrial shortage. Exports from the
                            U.S. are virtually nonexistent, but this fact constitutes no special
                            foreign relations problem. However, a number of governments, including
                            the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, and Spain have asked the U.S. for
                            help in obtaining nickel. In essence, their request, if complied with,
                            would mean a lower rate of accumulation for the stockpile.</p>
                        <p>The Committee, especially Senator Capehart,<note n="3" xml:id="d198fn3"
                                >Homer E. Capehart (R.–Indiana).</note> expressed concern at the
                            rate of progress toward the completion of the stockpile objective and at
                            the degree of concentration in the producing industry reflected by the
                            dominant position of the International Nickel Company. It was generally
                            felt that the Government should be more aggressive in fostering
                            exploration and development both here and abroad. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> was not unsympathetic with
                            this attitude but felt in general that all that is practical and
                            promising on any sound basis is being done.</p>

                    <p>On March 24, the Military Petroleum Advisory Board completed a report
                        entitled “A Worldwide Petroleum Program To Fuel a Major War, 1954–1958” that
                        it prepared for the Departments of the Interior and Defense. The study was
                        based on the military petroleum requirements computed by the military
                        services and on basic strategic assumptions developed and approved by the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff specifically for this study. The three main objectives
                        of this study were: 1) to establish the probable minimum worldwide civilian
                        and military requirements for petroleum in the event of a specific major
                        war; 2) to analyze the adequacy of production, refining, and transportation
                        facilities to meet these minimum requirements; and 3) to set forth what
                        needed to be done to correct any deficiencies of supply that might be
                        found.</p>
                    <p>In general the study concluded that, subject to the availability of necessary
                        manpower and material requirements, and if certain advance actions were
                        taken, the essential civilian and military petroleum requirements of the
                        free world in the event of a major war could be met. It cautioned, however,
                        that, since its conclusions and recommendations were derived from specific
                        military guidance and assumptions, the use of its recommendations to
                        formulate programs in wartime or peace without reference to these
                        assumptions would be unwise. A copy of the report is in Department of State,

                        background of the problem, and said he would call first on the Attorney
                        General for comment.</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General alluded to the fact that a trial run as to the effect of
                        the anti-trust laws on U.S. commercial activities outside the United States
                        had been provided by the Iranian case. He reminded the Council that the
                        Justice Department had withdrawn its criminal action against the American
                        oil companies who had participated in the alleged Iranian oil cartel.
                        Meanwhile, the civil case against the oil companies was proceeding
                            smoothly.<note n="5" xml:id="d200fn5">On April 21, 1953, the Department

                        laboratory lesson at the same time that the committee of lawyers had been
                        preparing the report which was now to be presented to the National Security
                        Council. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHJ1">Brownell</persName> then said he
                        would ask Assistant Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_BSN1"
                            >Barnes</persName> to summarize the findings and recommendations of
                        Chapter II, entitled “Trade or Commerce with Foreign Nations”.</p>
                    <p>Judge <persName corresp="#p_BSN1">Barnes</persName> outlined the findings of
                        the committee in its report, and indicated that the Department of Justice
                        supported the recommendation of the committee on page 92 that, for a
                        designated period of five years beyond the expiration date of the Defense

                        the anti-trust law. Judge <persName corresp="#p_BSN1">Barnes</persName>
                        added that legislation to accomplish this recommendation had been prepared
                        by the Department of Justice, approved by <gloss target="#t_ODM1"
                            >ODM</gloss>, and circulated.</p>
                    <p>Discussion then centered on the most desirable mechanism for consultation by
                        the Department of Justice with other agencies of the Executive Branch prior
                        to initiating legal action for violation of the anti-trust laws in instances
                        where issues of foreign policy or of the national security might arise. It
                        was the general view that the prevailing practice of informal consultation
                        on this subject between the Departments of State and Justice was
                        satisfactory.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then informed the
                        Council that he wished to make a few general observations with respect to
                        the committee’s report. He pointed out that the report had been prepared by
                        a considerable group of eminent lawyers for the Attorney General. The gist
                        of the report was that everything was more or less all right at the present
                        time. Moreover, the committee report appeared to agree with a number of
                        “pretty extreme decisions” by the courts.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then queried whether
                        the problem of anti-trust laws affecting activities outside the United
                        States did not require consideration from more than a purely legal point of
                        view, which was so apparent in this report. As a result of three hours of
                        conference with the Senate Finance Committee yesterday, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he was very worried over
                        the prospect of “unrestrained imports” into the United States from abroad,
                        which could result from the unfettered operation of the anti-trust laws.
                        Such unrestrained imports could quite possibly lead the United States
                        Government into the adoption of a quota system for the regulation of
                        imports, and accordingly, to a certain degree of socialism, which would be
                        far from welcome. Moreover, if indeed a quota system were adopted by the
                        United States, it would pose very serious problems in the area of foreign
                        policy. How, for example, would we set about apportioning quotas among
                        friendly foreign countries? All these problems, continued Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, led him to wonder whether
                        some kind of system, which would enable the participating commercial
                        companies to exercise some degree of control over imports of foreign
                        products into the United States, might prove to be better than the present
                        system which, because of the severity of our anti-trust laws, virtually
                        requires the most extreme competition. All this, said Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, should not be taken as an
                        indication that he favored veering away from so-called liberal trade
                        policies. It did indicate his belief that the whole problem needed to be
                        studied from a broader point of view than the strictly legal one.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> concurred in
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ judgment that the
                        committee’s report provided an excellent legal analysis of <pb n="527"
                            xml:id="pg_527" facs="0559"/>how the anti-trust laws were actually
                        affecting American enterprise outside the borders of the United States. On
                        the other hand, what really interested the National Security Council was how
                        best to promote private American investment abroad. It was obvious, said
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>, that American
                        money will tend to go where conditions abroad are best from a competitive
                        point of view. Moreover, the fact cited by Judge <persName corresp="#p_BSN1"
                            >Barnes</persName>, that only four anti-trust cases had been initiated
                        by the Department of Justice in the course of the last year, was not really
                        as significant as it seemed. The present antitrust laws were so extremely
                        severe and restricted that many American companies had simply made up their
                        minds not to run the risk of violating these laws. Accordingly, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> again agreed with
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> that the problem
                        represented by the committee’s report was not merely what the anti-trust
                        laws provided, but what kind of system will permit attractive foreign
                        investment possibilities to American citizens without at the same time
                        destroying the competition and free enterprise which we wish to preserve
                        domestically in the United States.</p>
                    <p>In response to Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>, the Attorney General
                        alluded to a recent report by the Cabinet Committee on Energy Resources,
                        which had reached the conclusion that the Administration should continue
                        with its present program of relying on voluntary restrictions of imports
                        rather than to embark on a quota system.<note n="8" xml:id="d200fn8"><ref
                                target="#d195">Document 195</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>In reply to the Attorney General, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> pointed out that these voluntary arrangements among
                        companies do not in practice work out for a very long period without
                        arriving at something very much like “concert” among the companies
                        concerned. They cut very close to violations of the anti-trust laws. Indeed,
                        many American companies are being forced by circumstances to skirt so close
                        to violations of these laws that it made one wonder whether the Government
                        will not in the near future have to readjust its overall policies respecting
                        the effect of the anti-trust laws on commercial activities by Americans
                        outside the United States. The last thing, said Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, that the United States Congress
                        really wanted was unbridled competition for U.S. markets from abroad. While
                        such competition was OK in the U.S., it was not OK from abroad. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to point out that
                        while the point of view of our country on this subject has matured, we are
                        still adhering to a policy with respect to anti-trust laws which we had
                        outgrown. The real issue before us now in this area could be put in a single
                        question: Where does the real national interest lie?</p>
                    <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0560"/>
                    <p>The Attorney General pointed out that one of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> agencies had come up recently with a recommendation for the
                        setting up of an international organization to deal with these problems. The
                        Department of State had opposed these recommendations, and in general the
                        U.S. business community supported State’s objections. In any case, said the
                        Attorney General, it was inaccurate to argue that there had been no real
                        study of this problem except in strictly legal terms. Finally, the Attorney
                        General insisted that the Department of Justice had gone as far as it could
                        under the law in an effort to safeguard the interests of American
                        businessmen doing business outside the United States. If it was desired to
                        go further than the committee report recommended, new legislation would be
                        required. The Justice Department would stand by the committee’s
                        recommendation that the President be given authority to exempt American
                        companies from the prohibitions of the anti-trust laws in connection with
                        the Defense Production Act for a period of five years.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> replied that the
                        five-year limit was very unrealistic from the point of view of the American
                        business investor. People could not plan to invest large sums of money on
                        the assumption that they would be exempted from the action of the anti-trust
                        laws for so short a period. Furthermore, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> thought that the United States
                        itself, and not some international agency, should decide what was in the
                        best interests of American businessmen. This was no mere legal problem; we
                        were actually confronted with the possibility of having to revise our entire
                        tariff set-up.</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General repeated that the present report of the committee had
                        gone as far as it was possible to go to clarify action under the present
                        anti-trust legislation.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the essence of the problem was the question of what
                        authority must be created to deal with foreign competitors rather than with
                        U.S. domestic competition. The President agreed that it would be essential
                        to look into tariff problems and the “most-favored-nation” clauses in our
                        commercial treaties. He confessed, however, that he was not sure as to the
                        next step that we ought to take.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> inquired whether it would
                        be desirable to extend the five-year interval of exemption from the
                        anti-trust laws in connection with the Defense Production Act, to a longer
                        period, perhaps of ten years. The Attorney General said that that would be
                        OK with the Department of Justice. This view was supported by Judge
                            <persName corresp="#p_BSN1">Barnes</persName>. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> went on to point out that we might
                        readily give the President more elbow room, perhaps even up to twenty years.
                        At the suggestion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, the
                        Council agreed to <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0561"/>extending the
                        period of exemption in accordance with the President’s discretion.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired thereafter as to how best to accomplish the more
                        general study of the problem which had been recommended by the Secretaries
                        of State and Treasury. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>
                        suggested that the Council on Foreign Economic Policy, with added
                        representation from the Department of Justice, was the logical group to
                        undertake such an over-all study. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> thought that this was the right forum, but warned
                        that it would take at least a year to complete such an over-all study.</p>

                        supplies of petroleum to fuel a major war, account was taken of supplies of
                        petroleum which could be secured by restricting public consumption by

                        replied that it was part of the basic responsibility of the Office of
                        Defense Mobilization to coordinate such plans, and that the factor of
                        rationing had been taken into account in the new study of supplies and
                        requirements for petroleum in the event of an emergency. Rationing, in fact,
                        accounted for an 18% cutback.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> then stated his complete

                                <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> paper. He wrote in part that
                            it did not “provide any reasonable basis for a serious discussion of the
                            policy”, that it was not only “highly abbreviated” but also
                            “deliberately slanted” with implications that were “improper and
                            inaccurate”. On September 13, a <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>
                            draft “Staff Study on International Commodity Agreements” was circulated

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> stated that this Department
                        would like to circulate a discussion of the subject as additional
                        background. He hoped that this would contribute usefully at whatever time
                        specific action problems might be considered by the Council.</p>
                    <p>The paper to be circulated by State would not be addressed to any particular
                        current problem. Circulation of the paper therefore would not amount to
                        pre-judging the position the Department would take on any specific question.
                        We have found in the past however that there is danger of some prejudices
                        concerning these subjects being aroused quickly after a specific question
                        has arisen. It is difficult thereafter to obtain objective consideration of
                        numerous aspects of the problem which deserve to be taken into account.</p>
                    <p>The paper we have prepared is therefore in the form of a review and
                        discussion of various ramifications and past actions. This has been checked
                        generally throughout the Department and has been submitted to staff members
                        in other agencies for comment. We did not ask for clearance by other
                        agencies but we have made more revisions in response to their
                        suggestions.</p>

                    <p>The particular type of presentation we desired to make did not lend itself to
                        the standard form of documents which are circulated as <gloss

                        the conclusion that the best means of circulation would be for State to send

                            paper for submission to the members of the Council on Foreign Economic

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Problem</hi></p>
                        <p>The national interests of the United States are directly and
                            significantly involved in a limited number of commodity situations which
                            at times require this Government to take a position on the question of
                            entering into an international commodity agreement. The subject of
                            intergovernmental commodity arrangements arises frequently in
                            international discussions of economic affairs. The United States
                            Government therefore finds it necessary not only to have a definite
                            policy but also to state it on numerous occasions with the object of
                            obtaining a wide understanding and appreciation of that policy and the
                            reasons for it.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Background</hi></p>
                        <p>For purposes of this discussion, trade controls which are concerned
                            entirely with considerations of security are excluded. Commodity
                            agreements are considered to include all other arrangements <pb n="536"
                                xml:id="pg_536" facs="0568"/>in which three or more governments make
                            specific commitments having the purpose or effect of regulating the
                            quantity or price of one or more commodities in international trade.
                            Such agreements may vary greatly in their form and methods of operation
                            as well as in their objectives, effects, and participation.</p>
                        <p>This definition is broad enough to include temporary international
                            arrangements for rationing or price controls to deal with an acute
                            shortage in time of war or other general emergency. However, the
                            practical problems and policy aspects of such emergency short supply
                            arrangements are clearly distinguishable (in the United States view at
                            least) from regulatory programs proposed or undertaken at other times.
                            The discussion in this paper is therefore limited to these other types
                            of arrangements which are designed generally to reduce the instability
                            of commodity prices even in the absence of severe shortages related to a
                            general emergency. The long term trend or average of prices is a
                            separate matter but the relationship of this to action taken with a view
                            toward moderating fluctuation is considered at a later point in this
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>It is not possible for governments to ignore the basic problem of
                            instability in the prices of major commodities. Many of the basic
                            foodstuffs and raw materials are subject to price fluctuations much
                            greater than those of manufactured products and greater than any which
                            are needed or useful for the fundamental economic purpose of guiding
                            desirable adjustments of production. These comparatively violent
                            fluctuations in the prices of primary commodities can have seriously
                            harmful effects upon large population groups and wide areas which are
                            heavily dependent upon the earnings derived from particular
                            commodities.</p>
                        <p>Some problems of this kind exist within the United States or develop in
                            this country from time to time in a manner which requires the earnest
                            consideration of this Government. These problems in the United States
                            present an urgent claim for governmental attention notwithstanding the
                            large and diversified economy of this country and its high degree of
                            dynamic mobility.</p>
                        <p>Some other countries are concerned by similar problems to a
                            proportionately much greater extent. Their total employment, tax
                            revenues, and earnings of foreign exchange are largely dependent upon
                            one or a few commodities. Developments in these commodities are vital to
                            the social and political structure in those countries. Excessive
                            instability of commodity prices can retard economic development and
                            reduce defense capabilities in many important areas of the Free
                            World.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government and other governments therefore find that
                            erratic marketing conditions for some leading commodities present on
                            occasion very difficult problems which involve a complex <pb n="537"
                                xml:id="pg_537" facs="0569"/>of considerations: social, political,
                            and strategic, as well as economic. The reality of these problems, and
                            the importance of the interests involved in them, warrants review of
                            pertinent United States policy and confirmation of its adequacy.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Basic United States Policy</hi></p>
                        <p>The traditional view of the United States emphasizes that a maximum
                            reliance on market forces will promote economic development and well
                            being. This is the basic policy perspective, notwithstanding numerous
                            exceptions, especially in agriculture. In the absence of a compelling
                            showing to the contrary in specific circumstances, this policy presumes
                            that the public interest is best served by a high degree of freedom for
                            individual enterprise and incentives under competitive conditions. The
                            policy emphasizes concern over rigidities which would inevitably
                            accompany wide-spread intergovernmental intervention in markets under
                            comparatively ordinary conditions.</p>
                        <p>Some who advocate a larger role for governments in economic affairs may
                            criticize the United States view and charge that it is excessively
                            passive or negative. The United States is convinced however that its
                            view is a broadly positive approach to economic progress. United States
                            policy seeks in general to release and encourage the constructive forces
                            of private enterprise. It recognizes that private enterprise requires a
                            high degree of freedom and competition for its full development in the
                            public interest.</p>
                        <p>Extensive resort to governmental controls could deprive individuals of
                            basic freedoms which the United States would much prefer individuals to
                            have and to use consistently with the national interest. Regulation of
                            production or marketing or prices could be a heavy drag on the
                            continuous process of economic adaptation toward more efficient
                            employment of resources and higher standards of living.</p>
                        <p>As for governmental policies which would best assure against undue
                            depression in commodities, the United States looks primarily to broad
                            measures (such as tax and credit policy) designed to insure the
                            maintenance of generally high levels of economic activity without
                            inflation. Successful administration of such policies would in itself
                            assure a generally high demand for commodities. The United States
                            considers furthermore that well-conceived national measures offer more
                            practical promise in this connection than international programs. It is
                            recognized of course that some underdeveloped countries, whose progress
                            and capital development are most heavily dependent on export earnings,
                            are also underdeveloped in their <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0570"
                            />capacity to administer effectively such contra-cyclical measures as
                            national credit controls and flexible tax policies.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Applications of Policy</hi></p>
                        <p>The United States opposes strongly certain lines of international action
                            which are sometimes proposed in connection with the international trade
                            of commodities but which would inevitably introduce rigidities and
                            substitute official decisions for private judgment and responsibility on
                            a scale so broad as to be unnecessary and unwise, as well as
                            impractical, in the United States view.</p>
                        <p>Such proposals include the concept of international parity prices;
                            regulation of relationships between the prices of primary commodities
                            and manufactured goods in international trade; commodity reserve
                            currency; and multi-commodity agreements.</p>
                        <p>Even in the case of the more limited type of proposal which is directed
                            toward an intergovernmental agreement for a single commodity affected by
                            exceptionally troublesome circumstances (such as wheat or sugar), the
                            policy of the United States is first to explore all possibilities of
                            satisfactory solutions which avoid direct regulation. Although this
                            Government has been willing to consider such situations on a case by
                            case basis, the United States has consistently placed a heavy burden of
                            justification upon the advocacy of a commodity agreement. When resort to
                            a commodity agreement has been found justified in an exceptional case,
                            the United States has desired nevertheless to minimize the extent and
                            duration of the regulation consistently with all of the national
                            interests of the United States which are directly involved.</p>
                        <p>If the original misgivings in principle are overcome in the course of
                            examining the particular situation it is nevertheless necessary to
                            scrutinize very closely the detailed arrangements connected with the
                            specific agreement. Commodity agreements tend to become very complicated
                            in their administration. They may require substantial sums of government
                            money. Such agreements need to be safeguarded carefully against becoming
                            continuing subsidies. Care has to be exercised that they do not
                            unnecessarily circumscribe opportunities for individual initiative and
                            competition and that they do not unduly jeopardize progress in economic
                            adjustment and economic development.</p>

                        <p>A realistic approach requires recognition that national price support
                            measures, particularly in agricultural commodities, are so firmly
                            imbedded in the policies of so many countries that the question of a
                            free market is irrelevant to the visible future of some <pb n="539"
                                xml:id="pg_539" facs="0571"/>major commodities. Modifications of
                            support levels can be discussed and frequently are. Some programs of
                            national governments could be shifted from prices to income support.
                            Such changes however would not produce a market situation essentially
                            free of governmental intervention in major commodities which sometimes
                            give special concern leading to consideration of commodity agreements.
                            The large scale of some governmental programs, such as stockpiling and
                            the disposal of agricultural surpluses, inevitably affects the nature
                            and operation of commodity markets, regardless of any decisions made
                            concerning international agreements.</p>
                        <p>The question of a commodity agreement appears in a somewhat unwelcome but
                            nevertheless special light if it is found that the advantages which one
                            would ordinarily hope to be attainable through a relatively free market
                            could not in fact be achieved irrespective of any decision concerning an
                            intergovernmental agreement.</p>
                        <p>However unfortunate this may seem from some points of view, the
                            alternative to a commodity agreement may not be a situation of private
                            and competitive trade on a multilateral basis. The alternative may be
                            wide-spread and uncoordinated national regulation; perhaps intensified
                            to a stage of economic warfare; emphasizing state trading, bilateral
                            agreements, and subsidies.</p>
                        <p>Wheat and sugar are examples of commodities in which regulation by
                            national governments is deep rooted and almost universal. The question
                            of an international agreement in these commodities does not present
                            itself as a choice between freedom and regulation. The actual decision
                            to be made is whether or not an appreciable advantage is seen in an
                            international framework for consideration and coordination of national
                            measures. The prospect is that national programs of regulation will
                            proceed in any case, with significant effects on the vital interests of
                            numerous other countries directly concerned with world trading
                            conditions for the particular commodity.</p>
                        <p>The United States is participating in the International Wheat Agreement
                            and the International Sugar Agreement. Neither of these agreements has
                            complete coverage of international trade in the commodity concerned.
                            Both have limited capabilities for effective stabilization but each of
                            them is credited with some amelioration of trade conditions which would
                            have existed in the absence of an international agreement. The

                        <p>Examination of a particular important world commodity has sometimes shown
                            that the advantages attainable by avoiding international regulation

                            interests in the particular case.</p>
                        <p>The International Tin Agreement of 1953 raised questions of this kind.
                            The threat of extreme instability in the price of tin was related
                            directly to the termination of procurement for the United States
                            stockpile. This instability would fall most heavily on areas in which
                            the United States has significant political interests (Bolivia,
                            Indonesia, Malaya, and Thailand). The United States decided not to sign
                            the tin agreement but recognized publicly that the agreement could be
                            made effective without United States participation and stated that this
                            Government would not oppose the agreement being brought into operation
                            if that was the desire of a sufficient number of other interested
                            governments. Entry into force is now awaiting ratification by
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>The number of commodity situations which might develop a balance of
                            United States interests problem of this type is undeniably small. It is
                            essential however that the United States specifically consider the
                            balance of its national interests in each such situation. The aggregate
                            of United States interests could not be well served by a doctrinaire
                            approach which took no account of the facts and United States interests
                            directly involved in the particular case. The attitude of the United
                            States toward such exceptional cases is a subject of intense interest to
                            other governments and significantly affects their overall appreciation
                            of the foreign economic policy of the United States.</p>

                        <p>The United States has recently indicated its willingness to consider with
                            other governments the special problems in the international trade of
                            coffee and rice, including proposals for stabilization.</p>
                        <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0573"/>
                        <p>Special programs of the United States Government for the export of
                            surplus agricultural commodities may stimulate interest in international
                            agreements for some of these commodities. Considerable opinion in the
                            United States has been emphasizing increasingly the objective that the
                            United States shall have a “fair” share of world trade, obtained through
                            various forms of export subsidies. However it must be recognized that a
                            declaration of “fairness” in such a matter can not be meaningful, or at
                            least can not be generally acceptable, if the determination is made
                            unilaterally. The quality of “fairness” in this connection is usually
                            taken to be meaningful only if the share reflects agreement with other
                            interested parties, since an objective criterion of “fairness” is not
                            ordinarily available.</p>
                        <p>There is no active discussion of a cotton agreement at present. However
                            the possibility of a revival of such discussion is inherent in the
                            present and prospective cotton situation, despite the administrative
                            complexities disclosed by previous extensive discussions of cotton
                            regulation as a practical problem.</p>
                        <p>The International Cotton Advisory Committee includes in its membership
                            most of the governments which are substantially interested in the cotton
                            trade. This committee keeps the world cotton situation under close
                            review and would be the forum in which any proposals for renewed
                            consideration of an agreement would be likely to be made.</p>
                        <p>The United States takes some actions or has some interests in
                            non-agricultural commodities which at times become related closely to
                            the nature and purpose of commodity agreements. These may set the stage
                            for discussion of an agreement or constitute a leading step toward such
                            discussion. For example if it is the desire of the United States to
                            avoid increased imports of lead, zinc, or petroleum, it might be found
                            as a practical matter that this would require an arrangement under which
                            the shipments by several other countries would be regulated by their
                            respective governments in accordance with a definite pattern established
                            through agreement among the group of governments, including the United
                            States.</p>

                        <p>The process of negotiating a commodity agreement has been found to be
                            very laborious. Great difficulties of reconciling divergent interests
                            need to be surmounted before an agreement can be brought into force.
                            Intergovernmental agreements therefore emerge only slowly and not by any
                            means in all of the small number of commodity situations where serious
                            consideration is given.</p>
                        <p>When an international agreement for rubber was a subject of major
                            interest to other governments, the United States avoided the <pb n="542"
                                xml:id="pg_542" facs="0574"/>difficulty in foreign relations which
                            would have resulted from a rejection of the proposals in principle and
                            eventually achieved a general recognition of the lack of necessity
                            disclosed by an examination of the facts on their merits.</p>
                        <p>Some of the commodity agreements which have been brought into force have
                            proven not to have very significant effects on prices or trade. Such
                            ineffectiveness is sometimes the result of the compromises in objectives
                            and methods of operation which were found necessary to induce sufficient
                            acceptance and participation by divergent interests.</p>
                        <p>To the extent that the practical effects of commodity agreements either
                            for good or harm in economic terms are less than those which might have
                            been hoped by some or feared by others, the total significance of the
                            agreements becomes proportionately more intangible. The primary
                            significance in some cases may be the effects in general relations which
                            follow from a willingness or unwillingness to consult and attempt some
                            limited degree of joint approach. This places the emphasis on forms of
                            international cooperation rather than on economic objectives or results.
                            The existence of a joint stabilization effort may induce some actions
                            consistent with its purposes, beyond those directly required or
                            demonstrably caused.</p>

                            Safeguards</hi></p>
                        <p>Any commodity agreement is likely to involve dangers against which
                            specific safeguards must be provided to avoid action which is
                            excessively narrow-minded in not recognizing all of the interests
                            affected, or unduly short-sighted regarding economic consequences.</p>
                        <p>It is not unusual for some or most of the governments concerned with a
                            commodity agreement to be preoccupied with the so-called “producer
                            interests” as distinguished from the “consumer interests”. This
                            preoccupation may not be soundly conceived either from the standpoint of
                            producing interests or from the standpoint of desirable economic
                            adjustments over a representative period of time.</p>
                        <p>Much of the United States thought concerning commodity agreements has
                            emphasized that they should not freeze patterns of production or
                            marketing or establish continuing subsidies. A corollary is that the
                            agreement should include provisions which would encourage and exploit
                            all possibilities for reducing the degree of regulation and returning
                            freedom to markets when circumstances permit.</p>
                        <p>A further point of much emphasis has been that stabilization agreements
                            should be guided by the principle of avoiding an increase or decrease in
                            the average of prices which would have been maintained over a
                            representative period in the absence of the agreement. <pb n="543"
                                xml:id="pg_543" facs="0575"/>The fact that this principle is so
                            difficult to apply in practice, even under the most favorable
                            circumstances, seems to make it especially important for the conception
                            to be firmly in mind and constantly stressed as an objective.</p>
                        <p>These propositions have led to the view that agreements should not be
                            binding on governments for long periods. There is excessive danger of
                            losing touch with underlying developments unless an opportunity for
                            review and reconsideration is allowed at intervals of five years or
                            less.</p>
                        <p>The United States has taken the position on numerous occasions that the
                            negotiation and administration of agreements should be subjected to
                            considerable publicity and disclosure of the principal policy
                            considerations at all stages.</p>
                        <p>The United States has consistently supported the view that agreements
                            should be open to participation by the governments of all interested
                            countries. Adequate opportunities for effective participation by
                            importer and consumer interests has been thought particularly important.
                            The United States has recognized that the equitable interests of
                            non-participating countries need to be borne in mind constantly and
                            assured of full consideration.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Facts:</hi> The U.S. has not determined clearly its policy
                        regarding participation in or support to <gloss target="#t_ICA1"

                        participation in a possible new international wheat agreement. Actions by
                        the U.S. with respect to <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>’s have been
                        taken largely on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                    <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0576"/>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi> The U.S. is now participating in two
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>’s: wheat and sugar. U.S. entry into
                        these agreements was largely committed by the previous Administration and
                        took place soon after the current Administration took office. Limited
                        agreements have operated in the past for wool and tea although they have not
                        included the U.S. A tin agreement in which the U.S. declined to participate
                        has been ratified by several governments but is now awaiting ratification by
                        Indonesia before entry into force. Conferences have been held to consider
                        agreements for cotton and rubber but no agreements have emerged. It is
                        possible that proposals will be made for <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                        >ICA</gloss>’s covering other commodities where special problems exist.
                        These include coffee, cocoa, rice, lead, zinc, and petroleum. Pressure for
                        the consideration of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>’s has come largely
                        from foreign governments primarily on the grounds that they are a possible
                        device to bring about price stability and an orderly sharing of markets.</p>
                    <p>Within the Executive Branch somewhat different appraisals have been made with
                        respect to the effects of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>’s. These
                        include differences as to the extent of interference with free markets; the
                        contribution to price and market stability, the usefulness in gaining
                        international support for U.S. actions to increase or maintain exports, or
                        to control imports; possible use to assist foreign economies, and the impact
                        abroad of the U.S. attitude.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Conclusion:</hi> Alternative U.S. positions suggested with
                        respect to <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>’s are as follows: <list>

                            <item>The U.S. is opposed to U.S. participation in or support of

                                be considered only when it is demonstrated that such participation
                                or support is clearly in the national interest.</item>

                                desirable. In approaching the question internationally, the U.S.
                                should take a sympathetic attitude and should consider the
                                participation in or support to specific agreements on the basis of
                                the practical interest of the U.S.</item>

                            proposed U.S. positions the Council adopted the following policy

                                <p>“The United States believes that there are few situations where

                                    in a particular commodity agreement only when such participation
                                    can be demonstrated to be clearly in the national interest of

                            411.006/9–1555)</note> I advised the oil importing companies that on the
                        basis of information furnished by them it appeared (a) that imports of crude
                        and residual oils had increased more rapidly than the domestic production of
                        crude oil, (b) that half the companies reporting imports of crude oil had
                        exceeded the ratio recommended by the Presidential Advisory Committee and
                        three-fourths of the companies reporting imports of residual oils had
                        exceeded that ratio, and (c) that unless company policy changes were made,
                        the imports would continue to be substantially above the standard
                        recommended by the Advisory Committee. This trend of developments naturally
                        pointed to the conclusion that, in the absence of individual voluntary
                        action over and above that already <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0579"
                        />taken, it would be necessary to seek other means of implementing the
                        recommendations of the Advisory Committee.</p>
                    <p>The information furnished by importing companies, and that available from
                        other sources, has been reviewed and evaluated in terms of the
                        responsibilities of the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization,
                        including the specific responsibility imposed by Section 7 of the Trade
                        Agreements Extension Act of 1955 (<gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss>
                        86).</p>
                    <p>Viewed in broad perspective, the results of this factual review may be
                        highlighted as follows:</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Oil Industry and the Level of Economic
                            Activity</hi></p>
                    <p>1. Stimulated by a steadily rising level of general economic activity, both
                        domestic producers and importers of petroleum products have enjoyed an
                        expanding market substantially above the level anticipated at the time the
                        recommendations of the Advisory Committee were announced. At that time
                        (February 1955), the contraction of our economy which characterized 1954 had
                        already given way to increasing production and employment on a broad front.
                        By September 1955, industrial production had reached a record level 14 per
                        cent above last year.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Crude Oil—Expanding Demand and Domestic
                            Production</hi></p>
                    <p>2. Responding to a record total demand for crude oil nearly 7 per cent above
                        last year, total domestic production of crude oil during January–September
                        1955 exceeded 1954 by nearly 6 per cent, despite a slight decline on the
                        West Coast. East of the Rockies domestic production was 7 per cent above
                        1954. Exploratory activity, as indicated by drilling, has been 12 per cent
                        above 1954, while well completions were over 7 per cent higher. The average
                        price of crude oil at the well has remained stationary during 1955 at the
                        postwar peak level of $2.82 per barrel. Stocks of crude oil on September 30,
                        1955 were down 20 million barrels or at the rate of 55,000 B/D from
                        September 30, 1954. While imports of crude oil during January–September 1955
                        were 16 per cent above the same period in 1954, the increase of 105,000 B/D
                        represents an excess of 67,200 B/D over the amount allowed by the Committee
                        recommendation, or less than 1 per cent of total U.S. crude oil demand in
                        the same period.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Residual Fuel Oils—Total Demand Up,
                            Domestic Production Stationary</hi></p>
                    <p>3. A sharply expanded total demand for residual fuel oil this year, exceeding
                        1954 by 8 per cent, failed to bring forth a larger domestic production.
                        During January–September 1955 domestic production remained practically
                        unchanged from the level of 1954. Supply was further tightened by an export
                        volume 26 per cent above <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0580"/>the level
                        of 1954. Stocks were drawn down during the first 9 months of 1955 by nearly
                        5 million barrels, averaging 20,000 bbls. daily, whereas they increased
                        27,000 bbls. daily on the average during the same period 1954. While imports
                        during January–September of this year were up 70,000 B/D, or 21 per cent
                        over the level of 1954, this represented an excess of 51,000 B/D over the
                        Committee recommendation, or approximately 3 per cent of total domestic
                        demand.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Imports Compared with the Committee
                            Recommendation</hi></p>
                    <p>4. The recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Energy Supplies and
                        Resources Policy, released on February 26, 1955, did not allow opportunity
                        for importers to make adjustments which could be reflected in the statistics
                        of the first quarter. Because of contractual obligations and related
                        circumstances, some companies were unable to effect significant adjustments
                        until much later.</p>
                    <p>5. Comparing actual and scheduled imports of residual fuel oil for the period
                        subsequent to the first quarter, namely April 1–December 31, 1955, with the
                        amount of imports allowable under the Advisory Committee recommendation,
                        there will be residual fuel oil imports of 7,000 B/D under the Committee
                        recommendation, if present programs are carried out. For the third quarter
                        the excess of imports over the Committee standard declined sharply and in
                        the fourth quarter scheduled imports will drop below the Committee
                        recommendation.</p>
                    <p>6. Comparing actual and scheduled imports of crude oil for the period April
                        1–December 31, 1955 with domestic production (partially estimated), and
                        excluding the special case of imports of Canadian origin, mainly into the
                        Northwest deficit area, there will be an excess of imports of crude oil over
                        the Committee standard, if present programs are carried out, of 50,000 B/D.
                        This is approximately 7 per cent above the Committee recommendation and is
                        under 1 per cent of total crude oil demand. Leaving aside certain
                        unevaluated information recently received, it is clear that certain
                        importing companies have made commendable efforts to follow the Committee
                        recommendation, including importers of oil from Venezuela who, we
                        understand, have been encouraged in this effort by the Venezuelan
                        Government. Nevertheless, these efforts have not been sufficient to bring
                        actual and scheduled imports of crude oil into a satisfactory relation to
                        the Committee standard.</p>

                        of the import situation for that period. However, my continuing
                        responsibility under Public Law 86 imposes the necessity of seeking full

                        find that voluntary action has been taken by all companies of such
                        character, both with reference to the last quarter of 1955 and the first
                        quarter of 1956, as to constitute substantial compliance with the Advisory

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> briefed the
                        National Security Council, and explained the issues involved in the
                        reference paper. He then called on Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName>, who had indicated a desire to make a
                        statement.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that he would like
                        permission to make a detailed statement on the problem of stockpile
                        assumptions in order that the National Security Council might proceed to its
                        discussion with a common factual basis. (A copy of Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>’s lengthy report,<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d209fn5">Not found in Department of State files.</note> on which
                        his oral statement was based, is included in the Minutes of the
                        meeting.)</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of his formal statement, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> went on to point out that he would now speak
                        bluntly about the implications of the facts and figures he had just given,
                        particularly the domestic political implication of these facts. He reminded
                        the Council that any action it might take with respect to changing the
                        assumptions on which the stockpiles were based, would have to be sent
                        unclassified to the Congress. Problems were bound to be raised by the
                        Governors of the western mining states.</p>
                    <p>In concluding his remarks, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> expressed the earnest hope that the Administration
                        would never permit the sale of any materials in the stockpile which were in
                        excess of estimated requirements, either for a 5-year or a 3-year war. If
                        the Administration did so, the effect would be to put the United States
                        economy at the mercy of the Executive Branch of the Government. This would
                        be a terrific power, which might readily be abused by some future
                        Administration. In short, the Executive Branch should be denied the
                        authority to dump materials from the stockpiles, no matter what was assumed
                        to be the length of a future war.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> spoke up and asked
                        whether this last statement meant that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> was never going to correct his <pb n="553"
                            xml:id="pg_553" facs="0585"/>mistakes of having bought more materials
                        for the stockpiles than were necessary for fighting the kind of war which we
                        might have to fight.</p>
                    <p>In reply to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> pointed out that at
                        least as far as the President was concerned, the fact that some of the
                        stockpiles contained more materials than might actually be needed for
                        strictly defense purposes could not be regarded as a mistake. He then
                        referred to the well-known views of the President that the possession of
                        such tangible resources by a nation made a contribution to its well-being
                        and economic health, quite apart from the contribution made to its national
                        security.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> then expressed his strong
                        personal predilection for doing everything humanly possible to cut back on
                        expenditures in the Executive Branch in order that the budget might be
                        balanced. He insisted, however, that one could cut back expenditures just as
                        effectively under the present stockpile policy, which set objectives on the
                        assumption that a war would last five years, as under the proposed new
                        assumption that the war would last only three years. The desired savings
                        could be effected simply by reducing the amounts of materials to be
                        stockpiled. Accordingly, in Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName>’s view there was no fiscal issue before the
                        Council, at least as far as stockpile objectives and expenditures for the
                        Fiscal Years 1956 and 1957 were concerned. Moreover, what really worried Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> were the severe domestic
                        political implications of changing the objectives of the stockpiles from
                        what would be necessary to fight a 5-year war to what would be necessary to
                        fight a 3-year war. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>
                        asked whether savings would actually result from such a change sufficient to
                        offset the domestic and foreign repercussions. Moreover, did not such a
                        change run counter to the President’s repeated views as to the value to the
                        United States of having a store of raw materials at hand? Lastly, said Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>, the President had just
                        requested that a study be made as to the feasibility of bartering surplus
                        agricultural products in return for strategic materials from the Soviet Bloc
                        countries. This proposed policy was presently to be discussed by the
                        Cabinet, and would obviously affect the problem which the National Security
                        Council had before it this morning.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MKDV1">McKay</persName> asked if he might now
                        be excused, in order to make a speech. Before leaving, however, he wished to
                        state his complete agreement with the position taken by Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>. Stockpile matters were riding
                        along now in pretty good shape. Rather than make a notable change which
                        would arouse the domestic mining people, he much preferred Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>’s proposal simply to cut down on
                        the purchase of certain minerals and metals. As Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MKDV1">McKay</persName> left, he indicated that Assistant
                        Secretary of the <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0586"/>Interior Felix
                        Wormser was extremely well qualified to represent his views.</p>
                    <p>Acting Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>
                        inquired about certain of the facts and figures which Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> had outlined in his opening
                        statement. As far as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName> could see, these figures were based on a technical
                        analysis of stockpile levels estimated on the basis of a 3-year war or a
                        5-year war, and did not take into consideration the foreign policy aspects
                        of the stockpile problem. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> indicated that the views of the Department of State
                        on the latter subject had been taken into consideration, but that the policy
                        of stimulating production of certain scarce items (in accordance with the
                        Defense Production Act) had not been taken into consideration.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the
                        assumption that a future war would last five years had originated in 1944
                        prior to the explosion of the first atomic bomb. He went on to point out
                        that the military requirements under the assumption of a 5-year war were
                        unilateral service requirements which had never been screened by the
                        Department of Defense and were inflated “to beat the band”. The whole
                        problem, therefore, needed thorough reconsideration. At the present time the
                        Air Force was talking in terms of a 60-day war, while the Army based its
                        calculations on a 5-year war. There was a terrible lot of money tied up in
                        this inherited assumption, and the assumption should be studied and changed.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> believed that in its
                        present deliberations the National Security Council should in the first
                        instance consider the stockpile problem on a strictly non-political basis,
                        getting its facts straight first. At an appropriate later time in the
                        discussion the domestic political implications of a change should be cranked
                        in. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> also believed
                        that the Council should realize clearly that if the United States ever got
                        into a nuclear war there would be no business as usual. The U.S. civilian
                        economy simply would not be able to absorb and use the vast quantities of
                        materials stored in the stockpiles.</p>
                    <p>In replying to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> stated that he too was
                        not very happy about the requirements set by the military for fighting a
                        future war. Nevertheless, he felt impelled to point out that in December
                        1953, for the first time in the history of mobilization planning, the
                        Department of Defense had given the Office of Defense Mobilization firm
                        requirements figures, even though these were unilateral service figures.
                        Since that date the Joint Chiefs of Staff had developed the Joint Mid-Range
                        War Plan, and this could provide the basis for putting requirements on a
                        sounder basis. Unhappy as he was, therefore, about the requirements, the
                            <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> was obliged to take whatever
                        estimates on the subject were provided to the <gloss target="#t_ODM1"
                            >ODM</gloss>. Moreover, he added his doubt that the National <pb n="555"
                            xml:id="pg_555" facs="0587"/>Security Council could ignore the domestic
                        political aspects of the stockpiling problem.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> then stated that in
                        his view this problem was not nearly as complicated as it had been made to
                        sound by the discussion up to this point. The Council should not concern
                        itself about placing contracts with the objective of stimulating the
                        production of scarce items under the Defense Production Act. This was a
                        separate problem and not in the stockpile picture. Nor was the Council
                        talking about the exchange of agricultural surpluses for strategic materials
                        except in the rare cases involving the transfer of cash from the Department
                        of Agriculture to the Office of Defense Mobilization. The Department of
                        Agriculture can go ahead and complete all the transactions it wants of this
                        sort. In essence, therefore, all the Council was concerned with was whether
                        the stockpile should contain sufficient materials on hand to fight a 3-year
                        war or to fight a 5-year war. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> emphasized that he could see no reason whatever for
                        the assumption that a future war would last five years. To judge from the
                        report of General <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName>’s Net
                        Evaluation Subcommittee,<note n="6" xml:id="d209fn6">Not printed.</note> a
                        likely period for the duration of a general war between the Soviet Union and
                        the United States was sixty days. Either the United States is going to have
                        a Maginot Line or else it is going to fight an atomic war. It cannot operate
                        under both assumptions. Accordingly, in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName>’s opinion, we must stop buying materials for the
                        stockpiles in excess of the estimated requirements for a 3-year war. He
                        added that he was particularly anxious to stop the further acquisition of
                        materials for the long-term stockpile in excess of the materials estimated
                        to be required for a 3-year war. He did, however, state his emphatic
                        agreement with the position taken by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName>, that we must never let any materials out of the
                        stockpiles and onto the market. If such a practice were permitted, the
                        Executive Branch could control our free economy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he was inclined
                        to take issue with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                        >Humphrey</persName>’s last remark. In certain circumstances it might be
                        desirable for the Government to sell materials out of its stockpiles.
                        However, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> insisted
                        that at the present time there are no excess materials in any of the
                        stockpiles which could be sold. On the other hand, if we keep on buying for
                        the stockpiles, they would soon be in excess of their objectives, and it was
                        for this reason that he was so strongly opposed to further acquisition for
                        the stockpiles. With respect to contracts now in force, the policy proposes
                        that where the stockpiles have achieved their objectives such contracts may
                        be cancelled if three conditions are met: (1) that the <pb n="556"
                            xml:id="pg_556" facs="0588"/>cancellations can be effected at only
                        nominal expense to the Government; (2) that the cancellations will have no
                        detrimental effect on our foreign policy; and (3) that the cancellations can
                        be made without detrimental effect on the U.S. mobilization base.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> then proceeded to
                        read to the National Security Council his proposed revision of paragraph 4
                        of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5414/1, as follows: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“No additional strategic and critical materials in excess of
                                three-year objectives should be purchased for the stockpile except
                                to complete existing contracts which cannot be cancelled at
                                relatively nominal cost, and without detrimentally affecting either
                                the domestic mobilization base or U.S. foreign relations.”</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> concluded with the
                        statement that if we limited ourselves to the above policy we would begin to
                        put a stopper on something that is about to run wild. There was, in fact, no
                        excuse for any purchasing over and above that estimated on the basis of a
                        3-year war.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> suggested that the
                        proposed revision by the Secretary of the Treasury might be more acceptable
                        if the words “at this time” were inserted after the word “purchased”.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said that he was
                        opposed to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s
                        suggestion. Moreover, he expressed the view that this meeting of the
                        National Security Council ought not to try to make a final decision.
                        Instead, its deliberations should be submitted to the President for
                        decision. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> added his
                        own view that the President was completely wrong in his theory that a nation
                        could never go wrong by accumulating large stores of raw materials.
                        Furthermore, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName>, the present period constituted a very good time to
                        make the shift from the 5-year to the 3-year basis for computing stockpile
                        objectives. At the present time there was virtually no pressure at all by
                        industry to induce the Government to make purchases for the stockpile. On
                        the other hand, such pressure was sure to come at some later date.
                        Accordingly, he would like to see this door closed before we get ourselves
                        in a position where the Government is subsidizing industry through the use
                        of the stockpile.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> observed that as far as
                        the long-term stockpile policy was concerned, the President had issued to
                        him a very firm directive. Changing the objectives from a 5-year to a 3-year
                        basis would have very little effect from the point of view of this
                        directive. What the President had told Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> in the directive was to compute the long-term
                        stockpile objectives on the assumption that all foreign sources of supply,
                        outside of Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean countries, could not be counted
                        upon in the event of war. <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0589"/>It was
                        this assumption, rather than any assumption as to the length of a future
                        war, that accounted for the expenditures rate and acquisition of materials
                        for the long-term stockpile.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> requested Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> to state explicitly just
                        what materials in the long-term stockpile were at the present time in
                        insufficient quantity to permit the country to fight a 5-year<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d209fn7">A marginal notation on the source text at this point
                            reads “?3”.</note> war. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> doubted if there were many such items, and insisted
                        that the long-term stockpile be operated on the same 3-year basis as the
                        minimum security stockpile. In point of fact, he said, this is the whole
                        issue now before the National Security Council.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> replied that at least he
                        could say that the National Security Council would encounter no particular
                        difficulty in formulating a purchasing program for the stockpiles during the
                        Fiscal Years 1956 and 1957, except perhaps in relation to the problem of
                        stimulating production under the Defense Production Act.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> agreed with Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>, and then said that he
                        would like to see us start with the assumption that all resources would be
                        denied the United States except from North America and the Caribbean
                        countries, and then proceed to see what contracts for materials for the
                        long-term stockpile could be cancelled because the objectives for these
                        materials had been achieved on the basis of a 3-year war. In short, he
                        wished to see precisely what materials were lacking for the prosecution of a
                        3-year war.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President commented that if the change from a 5-year to a 3-year
                        basis for computing stockpile objectives were made with a lot of fanfare,
                        the Council could be sure that this course of action would cause severe
                        domestic political repercussions. He did agree, however, with Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> that it would be a highly
                        useful exercise to get down to specifics and to make a determination of what
                        precisely would be involved if we made a change from the 5-year to the
                        3-year basis. Only as a result of knowledge of specifics would we be able to
                        estimate the effects, foreign and domestic. The Vice President added that he
                        thought there might be an advantage if the Council, instead of deciding to
                        shift from the 5-year to the 3-year basis, should decide on a policy which
                        stated that we would work gradually toward the 3-year basis.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that as far as
                        the whole problem was concerned, he would simply rather use some of the
                        money devoted to stockpiling to disperse and make more secure our SAC bases.
                        The Vice President then called on Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> noted that the
                        problem of stockpile objectives went back at least as far as 1944. As late
                        as July 1954 the Joint <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0590"/>Chiefs of
                        Staff had reiterated their position that the national stockpile should be
                        sufficiently large to cover four years of general war. They had offered no
                        views at this time on the current policy problem because of their view that
                        the stockpile problem was a good deal larger than the specific issue of the
                        probable duration of a future war. Nevertheless, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        had asked him to make clear to the Council that as far as they were
                        concerned, mobilization planning was not currently based on any assumption
                        whatever as to the length of a future war. The Joint Chiefs of Staff did not
                        know what an atomic war would be like, although they felt that if we had
                        reserves for six months the country would be reasonably safe.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> then said that there
                        was another very important issue that was causing a great deal of trouble
                        for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Pentagon generally—namely, that our
                        national policy objectives in the event of general war had not been clearly
                        stated. In particular, the current paper on this subject fuzzed up the
                        question of whether or not the United States would use atomic weapons in a
                        future general war.<note n="8" xml:id="d209fn8">Reference is to <gloss

                        was essential that this issue be faced and resolved. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> interrupted to express the
                        heartiest agreement with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName>, who went on to state that the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        were inclined to feel that computation of stockpile objectives on the basis
                        of three years of general war would probably be ample, particularly if we
                        cranked in an estimate of bomb damage. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName> concluded his report on the views of the Joint
                        Chiefs by stating their feeling that the most important effect of any action
                        taken to change the basis for the national stockpile policy would be the
                        effect of such a change on the allies of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> asked Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> what the Chiefs meant,
                        and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> explained that
                        the political and economic problems which would be raised for our allies if
                        we suddenly curtailed purchases of raw materials from them for the
                        stockpile, would inevitably have repercussions on the U.S. military
                        situation vis-à-vis our allies. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> said that he thought that the language of the
                        proposed change covered this point, since no existing contracts were to be
                        cancelled if such cancellation detrimentally affected U.S. foreign
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that in any case
                        he would say that if considerable savings could be made as a result of a
                        shift from a 5- to a 3-year basis for the stockpiles, such savings would be
                        enormously <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0591"/>helpful in terms of the
                        over-all U.S. military program, which was bound to cost more and more money
                        in the future.</p>
                    <p>The Director of the Budget stated that the problem of financing the stockpile
                        policy for the Fiscal Years 1956 and 1957 could be handled as a practical
                        matter without any difficulty under either the 5-year or the 3-year
                        assumption. On the other hand, for the years beyond <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1957 the 3-year assumption would be much more desirable. It
                        was in these future years, and not the present years, that considerable
                        savings would be realized if we shifted from the basis of a 5-year war to a
                        3-year war.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> commented that as far as
                        he could see, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName>’ remarks
                        amounted to inquiring why we should stick out our necks at this time by
                        coming to a formal public decision to shift from the 5-year to the 3-year
                        basis, when the amount of saving we would realize over the next couple of
                        years was going to be so very small. Instead of changing the assumption from
                        five years to three years, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> believed that the proper procedure was to decide
                        the amounts of materials we wished to stockpile on a strictly case-by-case
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> explained that he
                        was opposed to this ad hoc treatment. All it meant was that we were passing
                        the buck to another fellow who would be in a much tougher position than Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> was now to make the
                        decision. What we wanted to do, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName>, was to stop adding anything more to the long-term
                        stockpile on the basis of the assumption that war would last five years. For
                        the most part, the objectives of the long-term stockpile had been
                        realized.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said that he wished
                        to make two points for the record. In many places around the world,
                        purchases of raw materials for the stockpile were made with the sole
                        objective of bolstering the defense of the United States. It was for this
                        reason, for example, that we were purchasing Turkish chrome. The second
                        point, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>,
                        was that the Secretary of State was inclined to believe that what the United
                        States faced in the future was the possibility of peripheral limited wars
                        rather than a general war involving an attack on the continental United
                        States. If the Secretary of State were correct, and we faced a number of
                        peripheral wars in the future, the drain on our resources would be very
                        great. This provided strong justification for the extensive stockpiling of
                        raw materials.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion, The Vice President said that while he was certainly
                        no authority on the stockpiling problem, it seemed to him that you could
                        make very good arguments in favor of the proposed change from the 5- to the
                        3-year basis, or for reaffirming our present policy. On the other hand, the
                        resources of the United <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0592"/>States were
                        not unlimited, and we must select and choose the objectives which we
                        believed to be most important for the defense of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> again argued for the
                        wisdom of a case-by-case approach to the various materials in the stockpile,
                        rather than a blanket change from the 5-year to the 3-year period for
                        estimating stockpile objectives. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> likewise reaffirmed his opposition to this
                        proposal, although he now said that he was willing to agree to the insertion
                        of the language proposed by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName>, viz., the phrase “for the time being”.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President wondered whether it would be a fair approach for the
                        Council to propose a policy which would affirm the 5-year basis for the
                        computing of stockpile objectives where this longer basis was required by
                        reason of foreign policy and mobilization base requirements. Otherwise the
                        stockpile objectives would be calculated on the assumption of three years of
                        general war.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion, the Council requested, and Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> undertook over the next few weeks
                        to make, a report on the effects of using an assumed period of three years,
                        as compared with five years, for both the minimum and the long-term
                        stockpiles. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>
                        commented that if such a study were made the problem would solve itself.</p>

                        the matter at this time.</p>
                    <p>The International Sugar Agreement runs for five years with provision for
                        review and amendment during 1956, the third year of the Agreement.
                        Naturally, the individual member nations will be free to accept or reject
                        any amended Agreement. The proposed amendments may be considered at a
                        meeting called by either the International Sugar Council or the United
                        Nations.</p>
                    <p>Preparations for studying the effects of the Agreement and procedures for the
                        1956 conference will be discussed at the meeting of the Council which will
                        begin in London November 28, 1955. It will be necessary for the United
                        States Delegation to participate in these arrangements and in the 1956
                        conference. The recommendations in the attached memorandum make it clear
                        that the United States Government will be free to consider and accept or
                        reject the amended Agreement.</p>

                        <p>The International Sugar Council will hold its next meeting on November
                            28. Preparatory meetings of certain committees of the Council will begin
                            on November 23. The Council will establish a procedure to review the
                            workings of the International Sugar Agreement and to consider amendments
                            to the Agreement. As a result of this examination governments will
                            undoubtedly be asked to renegotiate the Agreement in 1956. Although
                            under the terms of the Agreement, governments are free to withdraw at
                            the close of 1956 without participating in the negotiations, it is
                            presumed they will participate and then decide whether to accept or
                            reject the revised agreement. Although the United States will not be
                            required to commit itself in any way at the November meeting, the extent
                            to which we express our views on procedure for prompt renegotiation of
                            the Agreement will be taken by other governments as indicative of our
                            interest in continued participation. The delegation to the meeting
                            should therefore be instructed as to whether this government is willing
                            to participate in the renegotiations next year and then to decide
                            whether or not to adhere to the revised terms of the Agreement.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi></p>
                        <p>Early in 1953 the Departments of Agriculture and State were requested by
                            the domestic sugar industry to use their best efforts to secure a new
                            international sugar agreement. Cuba and the Dominican Republic
                            considered that an international sugar agreement could be of great value
                            to their sugar economies, and they requested the support of the United
                            States. At that time the International Sugar Agreement of 1937 was
                            inoperative, and a negotiating conference called by the United Nations
                            was scheduled for July 1953. The domestic industry and the foreign
                            producers in the Caribbean were assured of the Administration’s support,
                            and the United States subsequently played an active role in the
                            negotiations which resulted in the International Sugar Agreement of
                            1953. The Agreement was approved by the Senate by a vote of 60–16 and
                            ratified by the President on April 29, 1954. Twenty-three nations,
                            including fifteen exporters and eight importers, are now members of the
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Although the Agreement was negotiated for a five year period, it is in
                            effect a three year agreement. Its terms provide that it will be open
                            for amendment in the third year, and any participant may <pb n="564"
                                xml:id="pg_564" facs="0596"/>withdraw from the Agreement at that
                            time. It is known that a number of countries are desirous of changes in
                            the Agreement and a conference to negotiate substantial amendments will
                            undoubtedly be held in 1956. At the meeting of the Council this month
                            preliminary steps will be taken to arrange for such a conference. It is
                            possible that the Council may decide to dispense with its own review of
                            the workings of the Agreement and ask the United Nations to call a
                            worldwide conference as soon as possible. This would have the additional
                            purpose of attracting countries not now members of the Agreement.</p>
                        <p>The International Sugar Agreement attempts to stabilize the world sugar
                            market within a specified price range by assigning each exporting
                            country a basic export quota and then adjusting these quotas to the
                            needs of the market whenever the world price falls below or rises above
                            the desired minimum and maximum price. The Sugar Agreement thus differs
                            substantially from the International Wheat Agreement. Whereas the Wheat
                            Agreement is a multilateral contract to buy and sell specified
                            quantities at minimum and maximum prices, the Sugar Agreement contains
                            no such obligations. It looks to balancing supplies with market
                            requirements in order to keep the world market price within a range
                            agreed as fair to both producers and consumers. While exporting
                            countries undertake substantial obligations under the terms of the
                            Agreement, the principal obligation of importing countries such as the
                            United States is to limit imports from non-participating countries from
                            gaining advantages at the expense of participating countries.</p>
                        <p>During its first two years the International Sugar Agreement has been
                            successful in stabilizing world market prices, but only at or slightly
                            below the minimum level sought by the Agreement. Many factors account
                            for this. It will suffice to say that despite the Agreement world
                            supplies of sugar have continued far in excess of consumption
                            requirements. The Agreement is however still regarded by most
                            participants as a desirable instrument through which countries can work
                            together to avoid chaos in the marketing of a commodity important in
                            world trade. Many countries are dependent on the export of sugar as a
                            principal means of livelihood. The International Sugar Agreement in its
                            exploratory stages has not accomplished all that was hoped for. It has
                            however come to be recognized in the marketplace as a constructive force
                            of substantial authority.</p>
                        <p>The United States has important interests in the world’s great sugar
                            producing and exporting areas in the Caribbean. The security of our
                            considerable trade and investment, our sources of necessary raw
                            materials and our military bases in that area depend upon the
                            maintenance of a reasonable degree of political stability and closely
                                <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0597"/>related economic
                            well-being. A sharp depression of prices and mounting world sugar
                            surpluses would cause extreme economic stress and severe political
                            unrest in this area. The United States, therefore, has a significant
                            stake in any international action which would help to eliminate the
                            recurring crisis which would upset this world-wide industry. An
                            important consideration for the United States is the fact that the
                            International Agreement does not change the pattern of our trade in
                            sugar. Our domestic sugar legislation will continue to regulate the
                            volume and source of our imports as it does at the present time. It is
                            the view of our domestic industry that an international sugar agreement
                            is important to their welfare as a means of preventing mounting surplus
                            in the Caribbean and resultant pressure on this market. The case for an
                            international sugar agreement is thus based on both domestic and foreign
                            policy considerations, and the Departments of Agriculture and State
                            cooperated closely to help bring the present Agreement about.</p>

                        <p>It is recommended that the delegation to the November meeting of the
                            International Sugar Council be authorized to take an active role in the
                            preparation for a negotiating conference next year, and secondly that
                            when such a conference is called the United States should plan to
                            participate and work toward a revised agreement which in the judgment of
                            the departments concerned can make the best contribution to the solution
                            of a problem in international trade which affects the livelihood of many
                            countries important to the United States and which, therefore, involves
                            directly the national interest of the United States.<note n="5"

                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board. The majority of the members
                        of the Planning Board recommended that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        5414/1, on stockpiling planning assumptions, should be revised to indicate
                        that, with respect to the minimum stockpile of strategic and critical
                        materials, the planning assumption for the achievement of the stockpile
                        objectives should be changed from a period of five years to a period of
                        three years. The so-called long-term stockpile could be computed on a longer
                        but lower priority basis so as to take account of other than the minimum
                        requirements for general war. Contrary to this recommendation of the
                        majority of the Planning Board was the recommendation of the Treasury and
                        Budget members of the Planning Board, who recommended that no additional
                        strategic and critical materials in excess of three-year objectives should
                        be purchased for the stockpile except to complete existing contracts which
                        cannot be cancelled at relatively nominal cost and without detrimentally
                        affecting either the domestic mobilization base or U.S. foreign relations.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> also briefly summarized
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>’s report to the Council
                        called for by the Council at its previous discussion of this subject and
                        titled “Effects of a Change in the Stockpile Planning Period from Five Years
                        to Three Years” (copy filed in the minutes of the meeting).</p>
                    <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0599"/>
                    <p>Before Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> had completed his
                        briefing of the Council, the President interrupted to state his conviction
                        that there could be no possible objection to keeping the five-year planning
                        assumption on the length of a future general war as a guide for stockpile
                        objectives, provided the materials deemed requisite for a war lasting three
                        years were accorded priority in procurement. The President went on to
                        explain his view that we would make money on this kind of a deal when we
                        were in a position to buy commodities for the stockpile when they were
                        relatively cheap—that is, by having recourse to selective buying for the
                        stockpile. For our policy to state simply that from now on we were going to
                        purchase for the stockpile only on the basis of an assumption of a
                        three-year war<note n="5" xml:id="d212fn5">On the source text, “was” is
                            underlined and a marginal notation indicates the correction to be
                            “war”.</note> was, according to the President, simply “nuts”.</p>
                    <p>In support of the President’s position on the preservation of the five-year
                        basis for the stockpiles, the Secretary of State reminded the members of the
                        Council that in the State of the Union message the President had called for
                        an exchange of U.S. agricultural surpluses for non-perishable hard goods. In
                        view of this statement it would be very unfortunate to change the policy on
                        the stockpile in the National Security Council at this time.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that while he
                        was all in favor of measures which would assist in stabilizing markets, this
                        was separate from the problem of stockpiling materials against the
                        possibility of a future war. With respect to the strictly military aspects
                        of the stockpiling program, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> said there were strong arguments against maintaining
                        the five-year basis. Retention of the five-year basis, he pointed out, would
                        certainly involve adverse influences on our military plans, which were all
                        geared to the assumption that a future general war would not last longer
                        than three years. It would be unfortunate if there were one planning
                        assumption with respect to stockpiling for a future war and a quite
                        different assumption with respect to the length of the war for every other
                        phase of our military planning.</p>
                    <p>The President replied pointedly to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> that the mere fact that we were striving to get
                        sufficient raw materials in the stockpile to see us through a war which
                        might last five years, provided no excuse whatever for fabricating ships and
                        guns on the assumption that a future war would last five years. These were
                        quite different problems and fields of planning. There ensued an exchange of
                        views on this point between the President and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>. In the course of this exchange Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> reminded the President
                        that at an earlier discussion of this subject the President had <pb n="568"
                            xml:id="pg_568" facs="0600"/>specifically informed Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> that he was not to use a five-year
                        planning assumption as the basis for <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                        formulation of our military plans for carrying on a war.</p>
                    <p>In concluding this exchange of views, the President asked the National
                        Security Council to imagine a situation in which the United States had
                        actually won a thermonuclear war. With so much destruction heaped on the
                        country and with our ports in ruins, it might well be a matter of three or
                        four years before the United States was once again in a position to import
                        the raw materials of which it had need from foreign sources. Indeed, having
                        these raw materials in the stockpile constituted a kind of insurance for the
                        United States, and it was particularly advantageous to obtain these needed
                        raw materials at a time such as the present, when the country was loaded
                        down with surplus perishable goods. He again insisted that stockpile
                        assumptions as to the length of a general war could readily be separated
                        from the assumptions which were to guide our military planning in the
                        strictest sense of that word. Finally, said the President, he could not
                        forbear to state that those who argued that a future thermonuclear war would
                        be won or lost in a period of thirty days were crazy. A modern war is not
                        going to be won simply by destroying the enemy’s cities.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> then asked the
                        President if he could be allowed a certain period of time to state his view.
                        The President agreed, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> began to state his view. He said he believed that
                        there was a lot of confusion surrounding the Council’s discussion of the
                        stockpile policies. We dealt too much in broad generalities. Instead, we
                        should actually look at the facts and figures. He was here referring, he
                        said, to figures on the stockpile which had been supplied to him last
                        evening by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> (copy filed
                        in the minutes of the meeting). In looking at these figures the first
                        distinction to be made was between items acquired for the stockpile which
                        are produced in this country and on this continent, and items which are
                        produced abroad. As for the latter materials, there was no particular
                        difficulty involved in acquiring them in exchange for our surplus perishable
                        materials. Items thus acquired from abroad would not overhang our own
                        markets and have an adverse effect on the domestic economy, but this was
                        only a small part of the problem. In the second place, it would be desirable
                        now to see what these figures said about the status of the minimum stockpile
                        of critical and strategic materials. Of the items in this stockpile there
                        are only four or five which were actually produced in this country or on
                        this continent, and in each case only relatively small amounts of such
                        materials remained to be acquired to complete stockpile objectives.
                        Accordingly, the minimum stockpile likewise presented no serious
                        problem.</p>
                    <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0601"/>
                    <p>Turning to the long-term stockpile, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> pointed out that if it were calculated on the basis
                        of the requirements for a three-year war, there were very few items which
                        would have to be imported from overseas. Moreover, on the same three-year
                        assumption, there would not be very much which would have to be bought for
                        the long-term stockpile in this country.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> then warned the
                        Council of the dangers involved in buying too much for the stockpiles as a
                        means of easing the burden of our agricultural surplus and in order to
                        assist agriculture in this country. It might well turn out that, by use of
                        the stockpile to assist our agriculture, we would end up by ruining our
                        mineral industry. If you gave an administration an unwarranted right to
                        acquire indefinite amounts of minerals and other items for the stockpile,
                        you were in effect handing such an administration the equivalent of a
                        despotic power over the United States economy. Naturally such powers would
                        not be abused by the present Administration, but a different administration
                        might seek to take advantage of these opportunities.</p>
                    <p>When all was said and done, concluded Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName>, it was the long-term stockpile, whose objectives
                        were calculated on the assumption that a future war would last five years,
                        that offered the Council the only problem of real significance. Of the items
                        in this stockpile, about half were or would be acquired in this country and
                        half from foreign sources. Moreover, copper accounted for half the total
                        figure in the long-term stockpile. This large domestic industry should be
                        protected from the unfortunate effects of government interference or subsidy
                        by use of the stockpile. The remaining items in this stockpile did not
                        present serious problems.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>’s
                        warning of the dangers to which the U.S. copper industry might be exposed if
                        it were in effect subsidized by the Government through large purchases for
                        the stockpile, the President pointed out that the zinc and lead industries
                        in the United States had been helped in a period of dire distress by
                        Government purchases of zinc and lead for the stockpile. In the course of a
                        lively exchange between the President and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> on this issue, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> broke in to point out that had we
                        not recently purchased considerable amounts of zinc and lead from Mexico,
                        our relations with that country might have deteriorated almost to a breaking
                        point. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> invited
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>’s attention to the
                        importance of the foreign policy aspect of our purchases for the
                        stockpile.</p>
                    <p>In reply to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said that if we
                        were proposing to subsidize industries for foreign policy purposes or
                        otherwise to help our foreign friends, we owed it to the Congress and the
                        people to tell them the truth about the matter and not to <pb n="570"
                            xml:id="pg_570" facs="0602"/>cover up by saying that we are purchasing
                        foreign materials for a stockpile as insurance against a future war. If the
                        Council was really concerned only with acquiring stockpile items as
                        insurance against a future war, there was very little indeed for the Council
                        to talk about. What was left to be acquired amounted to a very small
                        figure.</p>
                    <p>The President recollected various occasions in the past when he had been
                        troubled by serious shortages of strategic and other materials. He said he
                        believed that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>’s
                        views on the value of stockpiled materials was rather shortsighted. He
                        insisted, as he often had in previous discussions, on the real value to the
                        country of these stockpiled materials.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said that the issues
                        in the argument seemed to him to boil down to the following. Was it or was
                        it not in the U.S. national interest to have on hand a five-year supply of
                        materials in the stockpile? If the war proved to be short, such stockpiled
                        items would prove very useful in rebuilding and rehabilitation after the
                        war. If, on the contrary, the war proved to be long, it was obviously
                        advantageous to have a large stockpile of necessary materials. Accordingly,
                        on balance, Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> answered
                        his own question in the affirmative as to the desirability of a five-year
                        supply in the stockpiles.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said that he had one
                        last point to make. There were rumors going around of an intention to expand
                        the size of the long-term stockpile by as much as fifty percent in order to
                        help relieve the United States of the burden of its accumulated agricultural
                        surpluses. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said
                        that he was violently opposed to such a proposal, and that if it were
                        carried out it would put the country in an “awful fix”.</p>
                    <p>At this point Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that
                        he would like an opportunity to place certain facts bearing on the problem
                        before the National Security Council. After explaining the figures which he
                        had sent to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> the
                        previous evening, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> stated
                        that with regard to the question of insulating the stockpiles from the
                        market, he felt that Congress had tied the stockpiles up about as tight as
                        it was humanly possible to do. No sales could be made of materials from the
                        stockpile unless the President of the United States specifically certified
                        that such sales were to be made in the interests of the national defense.
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that he and
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> were in complete
                        agreement on the wisdom of this Congressional directive.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> endorsed the
                        feelings of Congress, but said that he had a vivid recollection of the Blue
                        Eagle days. What would <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0603"/>President

                        what Congress directed if they had decided that it would be advantageous to
                        dump materials from the stockpile onto the market? We would do well to
                        remember that in a year and a half’s time we may well have the New Dealers
                        back in control.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that our
                        difficulties with the stockpile problem were that there were at least three
                        different objectives in our minds with regard to the stockpile. Some wanted
                        it primarily for war insurance purposes, others for foreign policy purposes,
                        and still others for internal economic purposes. All of these objectives
                        were sound, but they were intermingled and confused.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he was entirely convinced that the biggest trouble
                        which faced the Council when it discussed the problem of stockpiles, derived
                        from the fact that none of the members of the Council had withdrawn into a
                        quiet room and contemplated for a period of time the real nature of a future
                        thermonuclear war. We were simply unequal to imagining the chaos and
                        destruction which such a war would entail. Moreover, the notion that such a
                        war would last for only thirty to sixty days was just about as specious as
                        the idea of a race between himself and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> to the moon. After the first exchange of
                        thermonuclear blows between the United States and the Soviet Union in any
                        future war, the United States would have to pick itself up from the floor
                        and try to win through to a successful end. In support of this point of view
                        the President cited various wiseacres in the past who had proved to their
                        own complete satisfaction that wars could either not be begun or that, if
                        begun, would last only a short time, because the contestants could not
                        afford to fight long wars. In point of fact, however, this had not been the
                        case in the first and second World Wars, and would certainly not be the case
                        in any future thermonuclear war. The President said he might be nuts in his
                        views on the value of the stockpile, but the recollection was still vivid in
                        his mind of the desperate efforts to get necessary tin, manganese and the
                        like during the dark periods of World War II.</p>
                    <p>At this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said
                        that he was going to take his back hair down and explain to the Council his
                        real reasons for opposing a continuation of the five-year basis for
                        calculating the stockpiles. It was simply that he did not wish to put $500
                        million into procurement for the stockpile if such a sum had to come out of
                        funds available to him for manufacturing weapons designed to prevent this
                        damned war. Indeed, he continued, General Twining and he were in a few
                        minutes going down to the <persName corresp="#p_HRC1">Hill</persName> to
                        take a <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0604"/>beating from the committees
                        of Congress with respect to alleged inadequacy of the Defense Department’s
                        weapons procurement policies.</p>
                    <p>Replying to this argument, the President observed that every member of
                        Congress on the <persName corresp="#p_HRC1">Hill</persName> would readily
                        find arguments to throw at the Secretary of Defense if such a Congressman
                        proved to be a partisan in his attitude toward our defense program. In point
                        of fact, said the President, we are now spending roughly $35 billion a year
                        on the defense of the United States, and I say that in the long run if we
                        spend much more than this we will actually reduce rather than enhance our
                        chances of preventing a war. We will do so because we will have aroused
                        genuine doubt, both among our own citizens and among our allies, as to the
                        essential stability of the United States economy.</p>
                    <p>Turning to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>, the President
                        stated that despite everything said, he would like to have the problem of
                        copper purchasing for the stockpile looked at carefully again. Copper was an
                        industry that produces at home. On the other hand, if we do not buy copper
                        from Chile, Chilean copper would be sold to the Soviet Union. For the time
                        being, at any rate, we should continue to take Chilean copper against the
                        chance of a long war.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> wondered at this
                        point whether the Council should not take one more look at the problem of
                        stockpiling, from the point of view of examining all the stockpile items
                        which are, on the one hand, produced in this country and on this continent,
                        and, on the other, are acquired from foreign sources. After such an
                        item-by-item look, the Council would be in a position to decide how to
                        resolve the differences of view. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> was confident that a way existed to work the
                        problem out which will secure all that we needed against the possibility of
                        a future war without at the same time upsetting our whole national
                        economy.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that he would be
                        very glad to undertake to provide the President with a special report on
                        copper as a substantial domestic industry. He noted, however, that no copper
                        had been bought for the stockpiles for some little time. Turning to
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> in particular, Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> reminded him that the
                        setting of the requirements for the stockpile was done by an interagency
                        group. It was essential that the heads of each agency give clear
                        instructions to their representatives on this group if the group were
                        expected to carry out its responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> again repeated his
                        proposal for a specific study of each item in the stockpile, and again
                        assured the Council that if this were done the Council would quickly be able
                        to reach agreement. The President in turn again stated his extreme annoyance
                        with those who entertained the opinion that a future thermonuclear <pb
                            n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0605"/>war would last only thirty days and
                        that, accordingly, it was foolish to have any significant stockpile. He
                        likewise repeated his conviction of the desirability of purchasing for the
                        stockpile during periods when the items desired could be procured cheaply.
                        He added his conviction that, to date at least, the Administration had
                        pursued a sound policy course with respect to the stockpile, although he
                        said he was willing to go along with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName>’s recommendation for a case-by-case study of each
                        item in the stockpiles.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> in turn once more
                        raised his objection to the existence of different assumptions for military
                        planning and stockpile planning for the contingency of a future war. With
                        some warmth the President replied to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> that the only thing we could really know about the
                        nature of a future war was that it would be completely different from any
                        wars fought in the past. About the only sensible plan, accordingly, which
                        could be carried out in the Pentagon would be plans to survive the initial
                        round of thermonuclear blows. For the period which followed this first
                        exchange, there was virtually nothing that could be realistically planned in
                        advance.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> then inquired from the
                        President whether the best solution of the stockpile problem would not be to
                        leave it that we stay on the five-year-war planning assumption as the basis
                        for procuring items in the stockpile, but actually instruct the Defense
                        Mobilization Board, an interagency committee, to study the desirable rate of
                        procurement of each item in the stockpile. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> opposed Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>’s proposal, and called for a
                        broader approach and a postponement of decision. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>, however, pointed out that this
                        problem had already been kicked around for many months, and that some
                        solution must promptly be reached. He accordingly repeated his proposal and
                        expressed the opinion that it was quite unnecessary to cause a rumpus on
                        Capitol <persName corresp="#p_HRC1">Hill</persName> by formally changing the
                        planning assumptions for setting the stockpile objectives from a five-year
                        to a three-year basis. We could achieve the objectives of such a change
                        equally well by slowing down the rate of purchase of materials for the
                        stockpile.</p>
                    <p>In reply, the President said that while he wanted to establish clearly a
                        system of priorities for acquisition of stockpile materials, he did not wish
                        to drop the present five-year basis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1"
                            >Anderson</persName> pointed out to the President that the view he
                        expressed was almost identical with the majority proposal made by the
                        Planning Board, together with the amendment to this proposal offered by the
                        Department of the Interior. In response to this, the President said he still
                        wished to retain the five-year planning assumption.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that as he
                        understood the President’s desire, it was that the stockpile policy continue
                        to use the five-year-war <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0606"/>assumption
                        in setting the ultimate objectives of stockpile procurement, but that the
                        rate of procurement of items for the stockpile should depend on the
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p>The President added that we should stick to the letter of the original law
                        setting up the stockpiles. If we did this, we could not go far wrong and we
                        would insulate the stockpiles from the market. Beyond this, there was really
                        not very much that the present Administration could do to meet the Secretary
                        of the Treasury’s worries about misuse of the stockpile by some future
                        President and Congress which was New Deal.<note n="7" xml:id="d212fn7"><p>In

                                of our people rather bitterly opposed to the plan for continuing
                                build-up in our raw materials reserve. Their fear is inspired by a
                                simple thing—that at some future date the government might, through
                                unwise release of these materials on the domestic market, do untold
                                damage to the American producers of these same items. This to me is
                                specious reasoning. If we have a government, and a Congress, that
                                would be guilty of this kind of action, then there would be little
                                hope for any kind of business in America. Yet the Congress would
                                have to be a party to such action, because the law specifically
                                provides that items from our mobilization stock pile can be used
                                only for emergency purposes.</p>
                            <p>“On the other hand, our present stock pile program does seem to me to
                                include a few projects that are unwarranted. One example is

                                        years. Although the first few months of conflict may be
                                        crucial in determining its outcome, planning for its

                            <p>a. The need for a stockpile of strategic materials required for
                                defense purposes was apparent in World War I; however, it was not
                                until 1939 that the Congress passed a specific Act authorizing
                                stockpiling of strategic and critical materials for national defense
                                purposes. Following World War II, during which strategic materials
                                shortages created many difficult wartime production problems, the
                                Congress reviewed the stockpile legislation, and, in 1946, passed
                                “The Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act,” (<gloss
                                    target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 520, 79th Congress) approved July 23,

                                        foreign nations for supplies of these materials in times of

                                Appropriations Committees, and the Joint Committee on Defense
                                Production all hold frequent hearings covering various aspects of
                                stockpiling. The Appropriations Committees usually go into
                                considerable detail in regard to the basic policies and proposed
                                expenditures for individual materials. Semiannually a complete
                                secret report is submitted to the Congress covering the status of
                                each material, and an unclassified summary report is likewise issued
                                at the same intervals. The current stockpile program has a long
                                history of bipartisan support and, except for a few minor instances,
                                Congress has not hesitated to appropriate the full amount of money
                                requested.</p></item>

                            <p>It is recognized that there are several different types of wars that
                                could be considered. Stockpiling is intended to meet deficiencies in
                                materials supplies that would exist in a five-year war calling for
                                general mobilization without attack on Continental United States and
                                involving ground, sea, and air forces, and high utilization of the
                                industrial potential of the U.S. Atomic warfare, involving sudden
                                and substantial destruction within the Continental U.S. and
                                consequent serious reduction of industrial capacity to consume
                                materials, could result in lower requirements. On the other hand,
                                the U.S. might be faced with prolonged small or medium wars of the
                                Korean type, in which serious cutbacks of the civilian economy could
                                not be tolerated and increased needs for military matériel would
                                require withdrawal of materials from the national stockpile.
                                Moreover, no allowance has been made in stockpile calculations for
                                the materials needs for reconversion to a normal status after a war
                                or for the rehabilitation of the U.S. in the event of massive
                                destruction.</p></item>

                                example, the military requirements for trucks, planes, ammunition,
                                etc., would include those items intended to be supplied by the U.S.
                                to allied nations in wartime. Where we historically export certain

                                made for such essential exports in time of war. In many cases it is

                            <p>Wartime supply estimates are developed by considering historical
                                production records as well as new developments, both positive and
                                negative, known to the technical agencies. For example, firm
                                industrial plans to bring in new mines within the U.S. or abroad
                                would result in increases in future supply estimates, while definite
                                knowledge that certain important mines had been fully depleted and
                                were about to close down would result in decreases in future supply
                                estimates. Supply estimates assume that sources normally functioning
                                in peacetime in the U.S. and in foreign countries will continue in
                                wartime, and supply estimates do not contemplate uneconomic
                                forced-draft post-M-day expansion which would be wasteful in time
                                and resources. To gross supply estimates are applied certain safety

                                        war, stockpile specifications provide for the acquisition of
                                        only a small number of grades—among the higher and medium
                                        qualities. In time of war material in the stockpile can then

                                reasonable prices in adequate quantity and quality to meet stockpile
                                schedules, foreign material is also purchased. Where Stock Piling
                                and/or Defense Production Act contracts will result in expanding
                                productive capacity every effort is made to encourage such expansion

                                priority is given to stockpile acquisitions necessary to bring the
                                stockpile inventory up to the danger point level. Once the danger
                                points have been achieved, acquisitions toward the remaining portion
                                of the minimum stockpile objective can proceed at a somewhat lower
                                degree of urgency. It is general policy to attempt to achieve
                                minimum stockpile objectives within a period of time consistent with

                                14, 1954, procurement toward the long term objective, once the
                                minimum objectives have been achieved, generally goes forward only
                                when the material can be obtained at prices advantageous to the
                                government (defined as prices normally lower than individual price
                                trends, with due regard for changes in the value of the dollar),

                                readily usable in the economy, whereby electric power,

                        since, in l950 and 1951, it was impossible to determine whether all-out war
                        (might come at any time. Consequently stockpiling buying by the U.S.
                        contributed in part to raising world materials prices. This effect was
                        welcomed by the nations that produce materials, but was of course deplored
                        by those nations that are industrialized consumers.</p>
                    <p>In past years it was also possible in many cases to have stockpile
                        procurement serve the auxiliary purpose of assisting the economy of certain
                        friendly foreign countries, for example: by buying Bolivian tin, Indonesian
                        rubber, Chilean copper, etc. At present, however, the bulk of the stockpile
                        is either on hand or provided for by commitments already made under the
                        Stock Piling Act and/or the Defense Production Act. Consequently, there are
                        few areas where new stockpile procurement could be of material assistance to
                        foreign materials producing countries.</p>

                        exclusively for domestic procurement a major portion of some of the
                        quantities in order to assist in maintaining the domestic component of the

                        imply that procurement will take place in any or all of the specified

                        requiring additional appropriations in future years. No commitment on the
                        basis of this table should be made to any foreign country or producer since
                        it is the responsibility of the General Services Administration to make

                        programs involving barter of agricultural materials for strategic materials

                        activities can and do assist in meeting defense objectives. In such cases
                            <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> is reimbursed for strategic
                        materials transferred to the strategic stockpile. However, unrestricted
                        barter activity to protect <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> assets could
                        occasion some difficulties for the defense program. For example, the <gloss
                            target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> is currently reserving certain space within
                        its unfulfilled long term objectives for certain metals and minerals so
                        that, in the event that the domestic industry is threatened at some time in
                        the future, procurement toward the remaining portion of the long term
                        objective could aid in maintaining the mobilization base. If, for such a
                        material, the <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> has meanwhile on its own
                        authority accumulated large stocks of foreign material to protect its
                        assets, government purchase of domestic material for the long term
                        objectives could be more difficult to justify. Moreover, since the law
                        contains no limitations on the manner in which the <gloss target="#t_CCC1"
                            >CCC</gloss> may dispose of the strategic materials acquired under Title

                        disposing of accumulated materials in quantities well beyond those routinely
                        traded in commercial circles. The knowledge that such stocks are being
                        accumulated and held could well operate to inhibit expansion by private

                    <p>To properly insulate such stocks the Council on Foreign Economic Policy
                        endorsed the idea that provision should be made for transfer of such

                    <p>Shortly after the start of the Korean war, the Government authorized (under
                        the Defense Production Act) several domestic mineral purchase programs under
                        which the Government guaranteed to buy materials delivered to it by any
                        producer at prices substantially in excess of normal prices. These programs
                        were initiated as a hedge against the possibility that all-out war might
                        come sometime in 1951–1952, under which circumstances those domestic
                        minerals would have been required to meet defense needs, since the stockpile
                        under <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 520 was then far from complete and
                        other major expansion projects required several years to get into
                        production. These programs covered asbestos, beryl, columbium-tantalum,
                        manganese, mica, tungsten, and chrome and were scheduled to expire at the
                        ends of various time periods (generally from 3 to 5 years) or when
                        quantities specified in the program had been accepted by the Government.
                        Specifications for some of the materials were lower than stockpile
                        specifications under <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 520, but material
                        usable by industry was normally purchased. However, in the case of the
                        low-grade manganese ore purchase program it was recognized that mills would
                        have to be erected near the purchase depots to beneficiate the low-grade
                        ores purchased.</p>
                    <p>It was originally contemplated that the programs would not be extended by the
                        defense agencies unless extension in time or in quantity were needed for
                        defense purposes. However, in 1953, the Congress passed the Domestic

                            67 Stat. 417.</note> which made a blanket 2-year extension of the
                        original program termination dates. Consequently, in the case of certain of
                        the materials, the Government has been required to buy materials that would
                        not otherwise have been purchased for defense purposes. In 1955 the Congress
                        passed H.R. 6373 which in general would have doubled all quantities that the
                        Government offered to purchase under the original program. The President on
                        August 14, 1955 vetoed H.R. 6373 on the basis that it would have continued
                        purchase of excess quantities of materials at prices considerably in excess
                        of market prices for certain minerals after defense needs had been met.</p>
                    <p>Where material from these programs meets stockpile specifications, and where
                        it can be applied toward existing minimum or long term objectives, the
                        material is added to the strategic stockpile under <gloss target="#t_PL1"

                    <p>Attached is a preliminary memorandum showing the effects on the world oil
                        situation of the inability to deliver Middle East petroleum to the
                        Mediterranean via the Suez Canal and the existing pipe lines. It contains
                        the information you requested from Mr. <persName>Eakens</persName>
                        yesterday.</p>
                    <p>The memorandum was prepared by a small working group consisting of
                        representatives of Interior, Defense and State, under the chairmanship of
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHA1">Hugh A. Stewart</persName>, Director, Office
                        of Oil and Gas, Interior. When Mr. <persName>Eakens</persName> called on Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHA1">Stewart</persName> yesterday afternoon to
                        discuss the matter, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHA1">Stewart</persName>
                        already was in conference with petroleum officials of Defense on the same
                        general subject. The attached memorandum represents a unified
                        Interior–Defense–State view at the oil-staff level.</p>
                    <p>The memorandum at this stage is brief and preliminary. A more thorough
                        analysis would require several days. The group that prepared the memorandum
                        could prepare a more complete memorandum if one is required. If the problem
                        is to be considered on more formal basis interdepartmentally, it is believed
                        that the appropriate body before which to lay the problem is the National
                        Security Council.</p>

                            approximately 14.2 million barrels per day. About 3.4 million barrels
                            per day of crude is supplied from the Middle East. Europe’s consumption
                            of 2.6 million barrels per day is supplied almost wholly from the Middle
                            East. European consumption is increasing at the rate of about 15 percent
                            per year.</p>
                        <p>The current Free World available tanker average is 2,211 ships. The
                            current average demand is 2,100 ships. These figures exclude MSTS’s
                            tankers and the 50 tankers in the Maritime reserve fleet.</p>
                        <p>A portion of these tankers are now being used to pick up in the Eastern
                            Mediterranean the 300,000 barrels per day delivered by Trans Arabian
                            Pipeline and the 500,000 barrels per day delivered by Iraq Petroleum
                            Pipeline, and to move these quantities to Western and Southern Europe
                            and North America. Tankers are also being used on the run from the
                            Persian Gulf through the Suez Canal to Western Europe to move 1,200,000
                            barrels per day.</p>

                                <item>In Case 1 and Case 2, because of insufficient tankers to move
                                    crude oil around the Cape of Good Hope, a major shift would have
                                    to be made in crude production substantially reducing production
                                    in the Middle East and increasing production in the Western
                                    Hemisphere. During winter months production shortages would

                                    2,000,000 barrels per day formerly supplied by the Middle East
                                    through Suez and from the Trans Arabian and Iraq Pipelines
                                    terminating on the Eastern Mediterranean, major shifts in
                                    sources of crude oil would be necessary to create shorter tanker
                                    runs. Crude oil production in the U.S. and Canada would have to
                                    be increased 1.3 million barrels per day, production in the
                                    Caribbean would be increased 200,000 barrels per day, and
                                    500,000 barrels per day would continue to be lifted from the
                                    Persian Gulf. The increases in crude oil production in the U.S.
                                    and Caribbean are believed to be possible for 90 days if
                                    extraordinary measures are employed. Beyond the 90-day period,
                                    grave doubts exist whether this production could be maintained.
                                    U.S. production for an extended period might fall far short of
                                    requirements. Considering the new sources of crude,
                                    approximately 160 more tankers would be required.</p>
                                <p>Since there is only an average excess of 110 tankers in the
                                    commercial fleet, the balance of 50 tankers would have to be
                                    withdrawn from the reserve “mothball” fleet. During winter
                                    months, the period of peak tanker demands, there will be a
                                    tanker shortage.</p>
                                <p>Under Case 1 conditions assuming extraordinary operations and
                                    controls, it appears that during a 90-day summer period,
                                    petroleum could be produced and moved to approximate free world
                                    demands. <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0624"/>Over a long

                                be radically different from Case 1, since Saudi Arabian production
                                and refining capacity utilized under Case 1 could be replaced by
                                other Persian Gulf sources.</item>

                                Therefore, 3.1 million barrels per day from the Middle East would no

                        <p>This indicates that there would be a shortage of at least a million
                            barrels per day of crude oil to the free world and consequently a
                            similar amount of petroleum products. Expressed as a percentage, this
                            means that the free world demand would have to be reduced 7 percent by
                            rationing. Such rationing, in peacetime, would create serious domestic
                            and international problems.</p>
                        <p>If the denial of Middle East oil were to be extended to one year, the
                            additional crude oil production that could be obtained from the sources
                            indicated above would drop to 1.5 million barrels per day. This would
                            require rationing of about 12 percent. This corresponds roughly with the
                            degree of rationing experienced in the U.S. in World War II.</p>
                        <p>Due to the above shortage of crude oil, it is considered that the current
                            tanker fleet could handle the transportation involved for this Case.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Secretary of State</hi>: In our recent talks
                        about the Middle East we discussed the problem of maintaining oil supplies
                        in the event of the pipelines and the Suez Canal being no longer
                            available.<note n="2" xml:id="d215fn2">Reference is to a conversation
                            between <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSR1">Makins</persName> on April 1, when
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked if the British
                            Government had prepared any studies on what should be done if the Middle
                            East situation deteriorated and the pipelines and the Suez Canal were no
                            longer available to their governments. The Secretary said he would like
                            to compare notes with the British on this problem and was especially
                            interested in the effect on supplies of having to send tankers around
                            the Cape, and in what possible alternative arrangements could be made.
                            (Aide-Mémoire from the British Embassy entitled “Suez Canal and Oil
                            Supplies”, August 3; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi>
                            880.2553/8–356)</note></p>
                    <p>I have now been asked to let you know that Her Majesty’s Government are
                        already studying this and hope to have the results ready shortly. They would
                        be glad to compare notes with the State Department as soon as possible. A
                        situation in which both the Canal and the pipelines were closed would throw
                        a very severe strain on British shipping; and the study will not be complete
                        until they know what oil and shipping could be provided from American
                        sources.</p>
                    <p>Her Majesty’s Government are also engaged in making a long-term study on the
                        movement of oil from the Middle East and the amounts of investment that
                        might be devoted to the various available forms of transport (essentially
                        more pipelines, improving Suez Canal, and construction of very large tankers
                        for use round the Cape and to United States Pacific ports). This involves
                        making assumptions as to future quantities of oil to be moved which are
                        extremely tentative. The Departments concerned are consulting oil and
                        shipbuilding companies in the United Kingdom. It would be most valuable if
                        on the American side a similar study could be made and notes compared with
                        us.</p>
                    <p>As regards the Suez Canal, the Foreign Office Legal Advisers doubt whether we
                        should have any legal right to intervene. First, no general right is
                        provided by the convention<note n="3" xml:id="d215fn3">Reference is to the
                            Suez Canal Convention of 1888, signed by Great Britain, France, Germany,
                            Italy, Austria, Spain, the Netherlands, Russia, and Turkey, which
                            declared the canal free and open to merchant and war vessels of all
                            powers in time of war and peace.</note> to use force for the purpose of
                        keeping the Canal open. Second, although it might be argued that the United
                        Kingdom, as successor to Turkey, would have this right under Article IX, the
                        terms of that Article make such <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0626"
                        />intervention subject to the request by Egypt. Third, in the light of the
                        United Nations Charter and the decision of the International Court in the
                        Corfu Channel case,<note n="4" xml:id="d215fn4">Reference is to the Corfu
                            Channel Case where the International Court of Justice ruled in 1949 that
                            the British Government was legally justified in sending a flotilla of
                            four ships of war with crews at action stations and with orders to fire
                            if attacked through the North Corfu Channel in order to affirm the right
                            of passage.</note> which also involved the right of innocent passage, it
                        is very doubtful whether it would be lawful for the United Kingdom or the
                        United States to take unilateral action by force to re-open the Canal. But
                        it might become necessary for all that. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1"
                            >Selwyn Lloyd</persName> would be very interested to have your
                        considered views on these points and the suggestion which you quoted on
                        April 1 that the Suez Canal had been an international waterway for so long
                        that if it were closed we should have the right to move in under
                        international law, even though it would have to be recognised that this
                        might be a major military operation.</p>

                            Middle East Oil is denied</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>As a result of your question on this subject, the matter was discussed with
                        the Office of Oil and Gas, Department of the Interior.</p>
                    <p>That department coordinates Federal petroleum policies and is responsible for
                        (1) contact with the petroleum industry; (2) priorities and allocation of
                        petroleum; (3) preparedness measures on petroleum.</p>
                    <p>In general, no detailed plans have been prepared. It is impractical to do so
                        since the situation is not static. It is visualized that when old sources
                        are not available, orders will be placed on new sources through commercial
                        channels. Arrangements will be made for tanker transportation as is done
                        now. Individual companies will increase production commensurate with their
                        capability and the demands placed on them. The demand for tankers would
                        probably <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0629"/>cause tanker operators to
                        buy the ships currently in the Maritime Reserve Fleet. Each nation would
                        impose rationing as necessary to keep consumption in line with available
                        supplies.</p>
                    <p>It is anticipated that Interior would probably set up an organization
                        (similar to the Petroleum Administration for Defense of the Korea period)
                        under the authority of Executive Order 10480 to handle the problems of
                        production, refining and rationing.</p>
                    <p>The Office of Defense Mobilization would probably be requested to declare an
                        “emergency” in order to give the Foreign Petroleum Supply Committee
                        “anti-trust immunity” so that concerted action by the member companies under
                        the Voluntary Agreement could be arranged to solve the problems that arise.
                        Similar action was taken to handle the “Abadan” crisis. The FPSC would
                        prepare a “plan of action” to cover production and distribution outside the
                        United States. Their plan would be in coordination with the British
                        Petroleum Advisory Committee in order to cover the entire free world
                        situation. The plan would be submitted to the Interior Department for review
                        and approval.</p>
                    <p>Coordination with French and Dutch petroleum groups would probably be handled
                        through <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s Petroleum Planning
                        Committee.</p>
                    <p>It should be realized that the above is a quick summary of the situation.</p>

                        days ago on crude oil imports, let me give you the Department’s views. We
                        recommend that no addition be made to the list of countries exempted from
                        restrictions on such imports. Venezuela and Canada, which supply the bulk of
                        our imports from the western <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0630"
                        />hemisphere, are already exempted. Colombia and Mexico are relatively small
                        suppliers. Their exemption might lead to requests that we accord comparable
                        treatment to other small suppliers in the area and possibly in other areas.
                        In addition, there are certain problems in our relations with Mexico which
                        make it undesirable to appear to single that country out for favorable
                        treatment at the present time.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>The Middle East is potentially the Free World’s most important
                            petroleum area. It contains the bulk of the proved oil reserves, is the
                            principal oil exporter and is second only to the U.S. in oil production.
                            Middle East oil now supplies nearly one-half of Free World oil
                            requirements (excluding the U.S.). Eastern Europe is almost entirely
                            dependent on that area for its crude oil supplies.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>If the oil-producing and oil-transit states in the Middle East deny
                            oil to the Western nations, they could, with their own manpower <pb
                                n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0631"/>and resources, operate their
                            oil industries at a low level but sufficient to meet their own limited
                            needs. The principal weakness of these states is not in production but
                            in the lack of their own tankers to move the oil and the distribution
                            facilities to market it in the Free World.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The Sino-Soviet Bloc is capable of assisting the oil states with
                            respect to skilled personnel, know-how, materials, and equipment.
                            However, since the Bloc is a net exporter of petroleum, it is unlikely
                            that the Bloc could absorb any significant quantities of Middle East oil
                            without a corresponding cutback in Bloc production. Moreover, the
                            relatively few Bloc tankers represent a maximum lift capability of only
                            about one-tenth of the current Middle East output.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Denial of Middle East oil would involve serious dislocations of
                            supplies for the West, necessitating governmental and intergovernmental
                            arrangements. The kind and degree of impact would depend in part on
                            whether the denial was partial or complete, and in part on its duration.
                            In any case, major production and tanker shifts would be required in
                            order to maximize the oil potential of other Free World sources,
                            principally the U.S. Gulf and nearby areas, and at the expense of
                            Western Hemisphere reserves. The fuel shortages would be severe,
                            especially in Western Europe. Pressure on oil and other fuel prices and
                            tanker rates would be intense.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Partial denial (as outlined in Case 1 of this report) would probably
                            reduce Western Europe’s supply of oil by approximately 15 percent of
                            present consumption, but further increases in production elsewhere and
                            rearrangements of transport could eliminate this shortage within a year.
                            By contrast, complete denial (Case 2) even a year after the initial
                            impact would probably result in a reduction of Western Europe’s supply
                            by approximately 80 percent, if the entire burden were borne by that
                            area. If the United States rationed its consumption in order to equalize
                            the loss, the Western European deficiency would be reduced, but the
                            over-all Free World loss would still be about 15 percent of present
                            consumption. In either case denial would result in higher oil costs, a
                            significant dollar drain on West Europe’s balance of payments, and a
                            slowdown in energy consumption throughout the Free World, presently
                            growing at a rapid rate.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>The immediate economic effect of denial on the producing and transit
                            states would not be severe, but after six months or more, and in the
                            absence of external economic assistance, a critical economic situation
                            would exist in those states which depend almost entirely on oil
                            revenues.</item>

                    <p>The Presidential Advisory Committee on Energy Supplies and Resources Policy
                        has made a re-evaluation of the situation relative to the imports of crude
                        and residual fuel oils. Enclosed with this letter is a staff memorandum
                        which has been used by the Committee in making its review.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d220fn2">Not printed.</note> This re-evaluation has been made in
                        the light of the following recommendation in the report which the Committee
                        made public on February 26, 1955.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>“The committee recommends, however, that if in the future the imports of
                            crude oil and residual fuel oils exceed significantly the respective
                            proportions that such imported oils bore to domestic production of crude
                            oil in 1954, appropriate action should be taken.”</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>On the basis of the facts set forth in this memorandum, the Committee has
                        arrived at the following conclusions: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item><p>On an over-all basis the ratio of crude oil imports to domestic
                                    production for the last nine months of 1955 was 5.17 percent as
                                    compared with 4.64 percent for the 1954 base period, excluding
                                    imports into District 5 (West Coast) and all imports from Canada
                                    and Venezuela.</p>
                                <p>We believe that, under present conditions, imports into District
                                    5 (West Coast) should not be considered in determining, on a
                                    nation-wide basis, the question of conformity or non-conformity
                                    with the Committee’s basic recommendation. We believe that this
                                    policy should be followed because there is no present indication
                                    of an increase in production in District 5. As a result, it is
                                    logical to expect a larger volume of imports into this District
                                    in order to meet increasing demands although it should be noted
                                    that during the period covered by this report the inclusion of
                                    District 5 figures would have a minor influence on the
                                    nation-wide analysis. The Committee will continue to follow the
                                    situation in District 5 and if at any time it concludes that
                                    imports threaten to impair the national security, it will make
                                    special recommendations applicable to District 5.</p>
                                <p>The reasons for excluding imports from Canada and Venezuela were
                                    indicated in the letter of October 29, 1955. Again, however, we
                                    call attention to the fact that any sharp increase in the
                                    imports from these sources (exclusive of the amounts needed in
                                    District 5) could threaten to impair our national security. This
                                    aspect of the total problem will be kept under careful
                                    surveillance by the Committee.</p></item>

                                    >ODM</gloss>, resulting in actual imports substantially below

                            <item>However, the increase in planned imports for the second quarter on
                                the part of some companies is a source of real concern. If these
                                plans materialize, it would result in an over-all excess for the
                                first half of 1956 which will not only offset the satisfactory
                                conditions indicated earlier in the year but will nullify the
                                efforts of a majority of importing companies to conform with the
                                Presidential Advisory Committee recommendations. It is hoped that
                                downward adjustments will be made in actual imports to such a level
                                below these indicated plans that the over-all crude oil import
                                situation for the year 1956 will show a satisfactory relationship to
                                domestic production, as recommended.</item>

                                    use, were below the figure suggested by the Advisory Committee

                                <p>In view of the fact that imports for ships’ bunkers and for

                                    imports for ships’ bunkers and for military use, are only
                                    slightly in excess (5,000 B/D) of the amount indicated by the

                                <p>This program is, therefore, substantially in accord with the

                                    be needed to build up stocks of residual fuel oils to levels
                                    consistent with past experience and to give assurance of meeting

                    <p>I wish to point out that, although our estimate of Western Hemisphere
                        availability contained therein is preliminary, we are satisfied of its
                        soundness as an “order of magnitude” figure. It is understood, of course,
                        that no commitment in regard to future eventualities is implied or should be
                        inferred from this estimate.</p>
                    <p>If it should become necessary to maximize shipments from the Western
                        Hemisphere to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>/Europe area in
                        emergency, the initial impact would fall primarily on the U.S./Gulf Coast.
                        Far-reaching adjustments to the U.S. petroleum position would result, not
                        the least of which would be a sharp rise in the price of crude petroleum at
                        the wells and of products to the American public, and a lamentable draft
                        upon U.S. oil reserves. Restrictive governmental actions, such as price and
                        use controls, might be called for to cope with problems incident to these
                        changes. To adopt such controls, for <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0635"
                        />which there is no precedent or authority in existing law under conditions
                        of peace, would entail serious political consequences.</p>
                    <p>A corollary to rising oil prices in the U.S. would be higher prices and
                        shipping costs on shipments to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> and
                        Western Europe with the need for dollar payments to a much greater extent
                        than at present. Although the British paper mentions 250 to 300 million
                        dollars as an estimate of added dollar needs “at current prices” under Case
                        A, this is believed to represent only a part of the probable potential
                        liability. It seems realistic to assume that such liability would seriously
                        aggravate the already difficult balance of payments position of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> and perhaps other countries as well.</p>
                    <p>As to the more detailed appraisal of operating factors mentioned in paragraph
                        12 of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> paper, we propose to explore
                        this second phase of our assignment in consultation with experts of the
                        Military Petroleum Advisory Board, and would thereafter be prepared to meet
                        with the British on the technical aspects of the problem.</p>

                            of the Interior (<persName type="from" corresp="#p_SHA1"
                                >Stewart</persName>), to the Counselor of the Department of State

                        <p>As agreed at the meeting with you on May 10, 1956, the following brief
                            comments are submitted with reference to the United Kingdom paper on
                            Middle East oil which you might wish to discuss with the British.</p>
                        <p>We have studied this paper and believe that the only specific question
                            raised that requires an immediate reply is contained in Section 7, page
                            2. This relates to the assumption that an additional output of about 25
                            million tons per year (500,000 B/D) could be promptly obtained from
                            Western Hemisphere sources in the type of emergency contemplated.</p>
                        <p>This assumption appears conservative in the light of information
                            available to us. It is estimated, solely upon the basis of a preliminary
                            appraisal of physical facilities and operational capabilities, that
                            about 40 million tons per year (800,000 B/D) of oil could be made
                            available in a short time for emergency shipment from the U.S.
                            Gulf/Caribbean area to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>/Western
                            Europe. Use of this figure would change some of the British
                            calculations.</p>
                        <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0636"/>
                        <p>In making this estimate no consideration has been given to the effect
                            upon prices or costs, either at the well or delivered to Europe, that
                            might result from the addition of so great an increment to the oil
                            production required from Western Hemisphere sources. Under conditions of
                            maximum production and tanker use, prices at the well and costs of ocean
                            transport would undoubtedly increase significantly. Neither has
                            consideration been given to political questions involving the
                            possibility of controls on price or use which might be required of the
                            U.S. or other governments under the conditions assumed. In peacetime an
                            act of Congress would be needed to authorize such controls.<note n="3"

                    <p><gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. returned his call. A. mentioned two
                        Middle Eastern problems. The Baghdad Pact matter was taken care of by
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s <pb n="605"

                            >Not further identified.</note> The other is the broader question of
                        whether this is a propitious time to undertake in Planning Board the
                        preparation of a new paper on the Middle East. The President said he felt
                        until some order began to show maybe we better hold and watch it from day to
                        day. A. wanted to check with <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. to be sure
                        he still thought that way. The <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. said the
                        only thing he thinks there is need of is an analysis of the oil situation
                        and what we would do in various contingencies. This would indicate whether
                        we can put pressure on the Arabs rather than that they could blackmail us.
                        A. said there is a paper that goes into various contingencies rather than
                        policy. <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. thinks that is the first and
                        compelling problem—what are the facts, and what do we do in various
                        contingencies, and how much of a chance are we taking? A. said maybe the
                        facts will indicate a new policy. The <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>.
                        has not seen the study. A. said it is available and thinks it is pretty
                        good. A. mentioned joint planning with British on oil. <gloss
                            target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. said nothing has been done politically. A.
                        mentioned, and only to <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>, … planning with
                        the group of American companies, and that would not come to Planning Board.
                        A. said the British paper comes close to the same conclusions ours came to
                        and the <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. may want to get <persName

                            <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. may want to see something else
                        explored. A. would like to leave it at that—until the President says so
                        there will be no review of the whole policy. A. referred again to the idea
                        of planning with the companies. The <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>.
                        thinks we should talk and plan and he would like to speak to <persName
                            corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> about it. A. said he wondered if
                        either side would talk unless the President clears it because of political
                        implications and anti-trust laws. A. will leave that with the <gloss

                        of the very tense situation in the Middle East, a series of studies have
                        been undertaken in connection with the Middle East Oil situation and notably
                        what we would do if certain contingencies arose involving the stoppage of

                    <p>To cope effectively with the ocean shipping problem, an obvious first step
                        would be prompt development and activation of a “Plan of Action” by the
                        Foreign Petroleum Supply Committee.<note n="4" xml:id="d224fn4">Regarding a
                            plan of action, see <ref target="#d226">Document 226</ref>.</note> To
                        accomplish this under conditions that prevailed prior to the promulgation of
                        amendments that became effective on May 8, 1956, would have required, in our
                        judgment, a very short time, perhaps 2 to 4 weeks.</p>
                    <p>This estimate, however, cannot presently be relied upon because the
                        amendments just mentioned have significantly changed the rules under which
                        the Foreign Petroleum Supply Committee operates. Until this situation is
                        clarified and new appointments of Committee representatives made, it must be
                        assumed that more time would be required to initiate such actions.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, however, operating companies doubtless would, each as a
                        separate unit, reorient their operations so as to best serve their markets
                        under difficult new circumstances. By these means significant progress could
                        be made toward rerouting effective oil shipments, limited however by
                        inability to fully integrate available <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609"
                            facs="0641"/>sources and transportation without regard to specific
                        ownership until a “Plan of Action” was effective.</p>
                    <p>Concurrently, steps could be taken to increase oil availability at tidewater
                        from Western Hemisphere sources on an industry operating basis to minimize
                        delay in picking up incremental emergency supplies.</p>
                    <p>It is our considered judgment and that of industry experts with whom we have
                        consulted that such adjustments as are required by Cases A and B could be
                        effected strictly from an operating standpoint to a point where an even flow
                        of oil from substitute sources would be achieved within a 3-month period.
                        During this interim, a continued receipt from loaded tankers at sea upon the
                        outbreak of trouble could be expected for one or two weeks to supplement
                        available stocks in consuming areas. Subsequently, a reduced flow would
                        begin from supplemental sources and gradually increase in volume as the
                        3-month period lapses.</p>
                    <p>The measures outlined, assuming fully cooperative action by Governments and
                        industry units involved could be expected, in our opinion, to meet the
                        emergency pictured in Cases A and B. No attempt is made to appraise the
                        initial stresses within the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>/Western
                        Europe consuming area. The probable severity of these may not be judged
                        without a careful detailed study on the ground. The financial aspects would,
                        we believe, present serious problems particularly with respect to increased
                        cost to U.S. consumers and the balance of payments of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>/Western Hemisphere countries.</p>
                    <p>Case C involves the most severe conditions. It would result in serious
                        shortages of oil supplies not only for <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                        >U.K.</gloss>/Western Europe but for the Western Hemisphere as well. It
                        would inevitably mean higher prices and much higher transportation costs.
                        Secondarily, to accomplish optimum results restrictions would be necessary
                        upon consumption of petroleum and controls upon prices. Authority for such
                        measures under peace conditions does not exist. Hence, new laws would be
                        needed to permit reasonable supplies to <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                        >U.K.</gloss>/Western Europe and to prevent runaway prices.</p>

                        necessary in the interest of national defense seems to coincide with my
                        letter of June 26 to oil importing companies requesting a revision of <hi

                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> imports of crude oil into Districts I–IV
                        during the first quarter of 1956 were 4.39 percent of domestic production;
                        for the six months January–June, the corresponding ratio (partially
                        estimated) is 4.97 percent. The corresponding annual ratio for 1954 was 4.65
                        percent. Imports of residual fuel oil have been in close conformity with the
                        1954 relationship to domestic production of crude oil.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of the information available on June 26, it appeared that, after
                        maintaining a level of operations during the early part of the year in
                        reasonably close conformity with the recommendations of the Advisory
                        Committee, some companies had made plans which, if carried out, would have
                        brought the volume of crude oil imports to a level “significantly” above the
                        proportionate relationship to the domestic production of crude oil for 1954.
                        For that reason, the Advisory Committee concluded that each importing
                        company should be advised that reports would be expected in July indicating
                        that individual voluntary action had been taken, with respect to planned
                        imports for the third quarter, of such character as to constitute
                        substantial conformity with the Advisory Committee’s recommendation.</p>
                    <p>In connection with your concern about the volume of “crude oil and refined
                        products” excluded from any restriction, I should like to call attention to

                                <p rend="flushleft">It is believed that the special treatment of oil
                                    of Canadian and Venezuelan origin is consistent with that
                                    statement of view by the Advisory Committee and with the
                                    requirements of our National Security. The special treatment of
                                    imports into District V, as stated in the May 11 letter to oil
                                    importers, rests on the fact that there is no present indication
                                    of an increase in production in District V to meet the
                                    increasing demands in that area. The Presidential Advisory
                                    Committee has made it abundantly clear to oil importing
                                    companies that imports from Canada and Venezuela and imports
                                    into District V will be watched closely for any developments
                                    which might threaten to impair the National Security within the
                                    meaning of Section 7 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of
                                    1955.</p></item>

                            <item>The re-examination now in progress of the Advisory Committee’s
                                formula relating to imports of crude and residual oils, initiated as
                                a result of the May 11 recommendations, will provide opportunity for
                                an evaluation of the evidence relating to the volume of imports and
                                of the conclusions reached since February 1955. It should also
                                provide a basis for such re-formulation of views as may appear
                                desirable.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>It seems clear that the objective which you desire is substantially in accord
                        with the objective which the Presidential Advisory Committee on Energy
                        Supplies and Resources Policy also desires to achieve. However, in our
                        desire to achieve that objective we must make sure that we are not
                        undermining some other aspect of our national policy. That is the reason for
                        the special treatment for the time being of imports from Canada and
                        Venezuela.</p>
                    <p>I feel that a national policy has been established that an unrestricted flow
                        of imports into this country would impair the National Security. I do not
                        believe that this Administration will deviate from such a policy. Methods of
                        carrying it out may vary from time to time, but I feel sure that you can
                        rely on the continuance of the basic policy.</p>
                    <p>I think you will agree that the letter of June 26 to oil importers indicates
                        clearly that we are following up vigorously in an effort to achieve our
                        objective on the basis of individual voluntary action by <pb n="612"
                            xml:id="pg_612" facs="0644"/>importing companies. You will be pleased to
                        know that the replies so far received indicate a very satisfactory degree of
                        cooperation with respect to planned imports for the third quarter of this
                        year. If this approach does not bring about substantial conformity with the
                        February 1955 recommendations of the Advisory Committee, I will proceed to
                        initiate hearings under the provisions of Section 7 of the Trade Agreements
                        Act.</p>
                    <p>I shall be very happy to hear from you at any time regarding this matter.</p>

                    <p>It will be appreciated that the attached communication from Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SHA1">Stewart</persName> deals largely with the mechanics of
                        arranging to produce a plan of action to ensure the most efficient use of
                        available oil, and shipping engaged in transporting it, and not with the
                        actual plans themselves. I understand that planning involving actual
                        quantities of oil and numbers of tankers at this stage would be of only
                        limited value inasmuch as the plan, to be of value, must relate to current
                        supplies, ships in position, loading schedules, and a variety of information
                        of that character, which the committee proposed in the attached memorandum
                        would be able to consider promptly.</p>
                    <p>You will note from the second paragraph on page 2 of Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SHA1">Stewart</persName>’s memo that currently the Foreign
                        Supply Committee is being reorganized, and it is anticipated that a
                        reconstituted committee will be in being in the near future. In view of the
                        most recent developments with respect to the Middle East, and particularly
                        the Suez Canal, it is for consideration whether we should not urge that the
                        reconstituted committee be established just as soon as possible.<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d226fn6">On July 26, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nassar
                            announced he had nationalized the Suez Canal Company. For documentation
                            on events following nationalization, see <ref target="frus1955-57v16"
                                >volume XVI</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>It is also for consideration as to whether, when this committee is
                        reestablished, it should not be requested immediately to undertake certain
                        planning studies. This seems particularly desirable in view of the fact
                        (pointed out in paragraph 2 of page 1 of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHA1"
                            >Stewart</persName>’s communication) that the Administrator, after
                        determination of an emergency, must notify the Attorney General of his
                        determination not less than ten days before making any request upon the
                        committee to prepare a plan of action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHA1"
                            >Stewart</persName>’s paper, which has been carefully gone over by the
                        Legal staff of <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> as well as Interior
                        indicates that before the committee can engage in actual planning, there
                        must be a determination that emergency exists outside the US <pb n="614"
                            xml:id="pg_614" facs="0646"/>that requires action. Obviously, it would
                        not be desirous, I think, for such a determination of emergency to be made
                        publicly, but I do believe the present situation warrants such a
                        determination, which presumably could be held confidential, so that actual
                        planning by competent people composing the committee can proceed.</p>
                    <p>Finally, you will recall that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon
                            Anderson</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> expressed
                        interest to you with respect to this problem. We undertook to get in touch
                        with him in due course to let him know whether we believed any <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> or Planning Board actions might be
                        necessary. Perhaps when you have considered the attached paper you would
                        wish to let Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> know your
                        views with respect to this point.<note n="7" xml:id="d226fn7">On July 28,

                                    >Macarthur</persName></hi>: As a supplement to our letter to you
                            of June 6, 1956,<note n="9" xml:id="d226fn9"><ref target="#d224"
                                    >Document 224</ref>.</note> regarding Middle East oil problems,
                            the following sets forth in greater detail the measures that the United
                            States government would have to take to meet effectively the conditions
                            assumed.</p>
                        <p>The alleviation of shortages arising from a substantial loss of any of
                            the current sources of world petroleum supply would require cooperative
                            action among domestic companies having foreign petroleum operations and
                            foreign companies. A mechanism for such action exists in the Voluntary
                            Agreement Relating to Foreign Petroleum Supply under Section 708 of the
                            Defense Production Act of 1950.</p>
                        <p>Cases A, B, and C, appear to present situations in which action under the
                            Voluntary Agreement would promote the national defense, <pb n="615"
                                xml:id="pg_615" facs="0647"/>and assuming that such a determination
                            were made, the following steps would be required.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The Administrator (Secretary of the Interior or Assistant
                                Secretary, Interior-Mineral Resources) determines that an emergency
                                exists outside the U.S. that requires action.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The Administrator notifies the Attorney General of this
                                determination <hi rend="italic">not less than 10 days before making
                                    any request upon the Foreign Petroleum Supply
                                Committee</hi>.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The Director of the Voluntary Agreement then submits to the
                                Foreign Petroleum Supply Committee a request to prepare a plan or
                                plans of action.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The Committee prepares and submits in writing to the Administrator
                                recommended plans of action.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>The Administrator approves a “Plan of Action” and submits it to
                                the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization for approval in
                                accord with Section 708 of the Defense Production Act of 1950. The
                                Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization must consult with the
                                Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General
                                and obtain the approval of the latter.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Upon approval of a Plan of Action by the Director of the Office of
                                Defense Mobilization and the approval and issuance by the
                                Administrator of schedules prepared by the Committee implementing
                                the plan, action may be taken pursuant to such schedules.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>As previously stated, we estimate that the process summarized above would
                            take from 2 to 4 weeks. Currently the Foreign Petroleum Supply Committee
                            is being reorganized in response to new rules promulgated by the
                            Attorney General of the U.S. as amendments to the Voluntary Agreement
                            under which the Committee operates. It is anticipated that a
                            reconstituted Committee will be in being in the near future.</p>
                        <p>Operations under a Plan or Plans of Action would be designed to integrate
                            to the extent necessary and appropriate the scheduling and movements of
                            ocean tank ships under control of both U.S. and foreign companies into a
                            unified operation, efficiently related to sources of incremental oil
                            supply as available (or susceptible of rapid development) to offset oil
                            that is denied its customary markets by emergency circumstances. Related
                            adjustments to refining operations, crude oil production, and inland
                            transport would be made by industry management in response to usual
                            economic incentives. From an operations point of view, it is believed
                            these measures might reasonably be expected to meet the principal
                            problems posed by Cases A and B and initial stresses under Case C.</p>
                        <p>Attendant financial and foreign exchange problems, however, have not been
                            studied because of the breadth and complexity of this field.
                            Consideration might be given to a joint task group composed of British
                            and United States people, or initially to a British group in recognition
                            of the contribution they could make to knowledge of <pb n="616"
                                xml:id="pg_616" facs="0648"/>Sterling–dollar capabilities. Such a
                            study would suggest areas in which U.S. Government action might be
                            considered desirable.</p>
                        <p>Conditions of Case C would require drastic action by the United States
                            Government in the United States, It would undoubtedly create shortages
                            of petroleum products for domestic use. This would force allocation of
                            products, possible rationing, and might require price controls.</p>
                        <p>There is presently no authority to control prices. Authority does exist
                            under Section 101 of the Defense Production Act to allocate materials in
                            order to promote the national defense. Presumably Case C would present a
                            situation which would justify a determination that the exercise of the
                            priorities and allocation powers would serve such a purpose. These
                            powers could be exercised to control the general distribution of
                            petroleum products in the civilian market only after a finding by the
                            Secretary of the Interior that the products to be allocated or rationed
                            are scarce and critical materials essential to the national defense, and
                            “that the requirements of the national defense for such material cannot
                            otherwise be met without creating a significant dislocation of the
                            normal distribution of such material in the civilian market to such a
                            degree as to create an appreciable hardship,” and the approval of such
                            finding by the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization.</p>
                        <p>Assuming that a determination was made that the use of the priority
                            allocation powers was required for national defense, it would be
                            necessary as a minimum to establish a headquarters organization of
                            considerable size if any extensive use of the power to allocate was to
                            be made. Such a central organization probably could be brought into
                            being within a period of four to eight weeks. If it became necessary to
                            institute rationing among consumers, a field organization would have to
                            be created to administer such program. Such a field organization could
                            hardly be established in less than four months.</p>

                        of the Suez situation. They agreed that the Office of Defense Mobilization
                        and the Department of the Interior should ask a few selected oil companies
                        to meet with government representatives to initiate planning of emergency

                    <p>As you know, a Committee has been established under the Voluntary Agreement
                        Relating to Foreign Petroleum Supply, as amended, to advise the Government
                        of the United States on plans of action designed to prevent, eliminate or
                        alleviate shortages of petroleum supplies in friendly foreign nations which
                        threaten to affect adversely the defense mobilization interests or programs
                        of the United States.</p>
                    <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0650"/>
                    <p>I have discussed the present situation and the above contingencies with the
                        Secretary of State and the Under Secretary of State, and, as a result of
                        these discussions, I believe that an emergency exists outside the United
                        States which requires action in the form of the development of plans
                        designed to prevent, eliminate or alleviate shortages of petroleum supplies
                        which threaten to affect adversely the defense mobilization interests or
                        programs of the United States. Under the circumstances I feel that it would
                        be appropriate for you to find that an emergency exists and to submit to the
                        Committee a request for the preparation of plans of action to meet such
                        contingencies if they should arise.</p>
                    <p>As you know, the voluntary agreement requires that the Attorney General be
                        notified of any request to the Committee to prepare a plan of action. On
                        advice of counsel, I am of the opinion that such notification may be
                        followed immediately by the request to the Committee for the preparation of
                        the plans. If you have doubt as to the regularity of this procedure, I
                        recommend that in the interest of prompt action the Attorney General be
                        requested to waive his right to any earlier notification.<note n="2"

                                    >MEEC</gloss>) composed of representatives of American petroleum
                                companies engaged in foreign operations. The FPSC, responsible for
                                appraising the oil requirements of all countries of the West and
                                coordinating supplies, storage facilities, and tankers, met
                                regularly from August through October. After the Anglo-French
                                invasion of Egypt on October 30, its meetings were temporarily
                                suspended. (Memorandum of telephone conversation by William M.

                    </list>
                    <p>The subject meeting was held in the Department of State following the
                        initiative of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Arthur Flemming</persName>,
                        Director of <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>, who had previously heard
                        the Secretary discuss the question of nationalization and considered it a
                        subject of considerable interest to American oil companies in view of their
                        concern that Egypt’s action on the Suez Canal would give additional impetus
                        to Arab nationalization of oil production in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>It was considered desirable, as a matter of form, to let the companies know
                        about the Department’s views on nationalization through the medium of a
                        regular meeting of the FPSC rather than to call senior officials of the oil
                        companies to the Department for the purpose of a briefing discussion with
                        the Secretary. Consequently, the regular membership of the Committee was
                        present. See the attached list for the names of companies and their
                        representatives. Present also were Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName>, Assistant Secretary of Interior Wormser, Assistant
                        Attorney General Hanson, in charge of the Anti-Trust Division, several
                        members of the Oil and Gas Division of Interior and several members of the
                        Department of State. These also are listed on the attachment.</p>
                    <p>The meeting was opened by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHA1">Stewart</persName>
                        who had the roll called by the Committee’s Secretary. He then introduced Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>. The latter explained
                        that he had previously asked the Secretary if he would be willing to talk to
                        the group regarding nationalization and that the meeting had been set up
                        following the Secretary’s agreement to do so.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary opened his remarks by stressing the seriousness of the Suez
                        situation noting in particular the concern of all regarding the oil aspects
                        of the problem. He mentioned his appreciation that a plan of action was
                        being prepared noting that lack of alternatives in a given situation
                        frequently left one awkwardly placed. He noted his own concern of several
                        month’s standing regarding the possible stoppage of transport from the
                        Middle East and the breakdown of <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0652"
                        />production in that area. The Secretary then referred to the
                        nationalization of the Suez Canal Company and the possible ramifications of
                        this action on oil interests in the Middle East. He assured the group that
                        nothing would be done in London on nationalization which would jeopardize
                        the oil concessions. There was no thought, he said, of acquiescing in any
                        right of nationalization which would have unfavorable implications on the
                        properties in which the companies had interests.</p>
                    <p>He called particular attention to the point in the London communiqué<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d229fn2">Reference is to the Tripartite Statement on the
                            Nationalization of the Universal Suez Canal Company, issued at London by
                            the Governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France on
                            August 2, 1956. See Department of State Bulletin, August 13, 1956, <ref
                                target="#pg_262">pp. 262</ref>–<ref target="#pg_263"
                            >263</ref>.</note> in which the view was advanced as an extension of the
                        present international law view on nationalization that it was not applicable
                        to assets which were impressed with an international interest. He described
                        this view as a major extension of the U.S. view on nationalization which, it
                        was hoped, would extend the protection we could give U.S. interests and
                        properties.</p>
                    <p>By way of explanation, he described the situation in which a government, on
                        the basis of assurance, that for a fixed duration it would have access to
                        specific commodities or facilities had accepted a dependence on another
                        government or had based their economies on lines they would not have
                        followed except for such assurances. In such cases, the country controlling
                        the facility or property should be regarded estopped from nationalizing such
                        facilities or properties. The Secretary said that there must be an
                        abandonment of the right of nationalization in cases of this character.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. does not intend to concede the right of Egypt to terminate the
                        concessions of the company twelve years ahead of time. However, merely to
                        restore the status quo would not be a satisfactory solution in the
                        circumstances. Expansion of the Canal was clearly needed. It was evident
                        that there would not be a sufficient time in the remaining twelve years to
                        finance the kind of improvements required. Also, something better than the
                        present concession and convention was needed to prevent Egypt using force as
                        her stopping of Israeli bound ships, showed she was clearly capable of
                        doing.</p>
                    <p>Following the Secretary’s presentations of his views and a short question and
                        answer period relating to nationalization, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> spoke briefly of the assurances he had had from the
                        Attorney General and his confidence that there would be no legal barriers to
                        the kind of consultation and joint planning which the companies intended to
                        do.</p>

                    <p>For at least the fourth time within a 12-month period Commerce has proposed

                        export of ferrous scrap. On the other occasions that this matter had been
                        considered, the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> had turned down the

                        the immediate imposition of restrictions on the licensing of ferrous scrap
                        exports to the level which the major scrap importing countries had earlier
                        indicated would be their estimated requirements from the United States for
                        calendar year 1956. (In this conclusion, Commerce listed the <gloss

                        while the British Embassy had earlier informed us that its requirements from

                    <p>At the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> Staff Meeting of October 3,
                        1956, the Commerce representatives stated that the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss> was being asked to approve the principle that export
                        restrictions would be placed on ferrous scrap exports in calendar year 1957.
                        The exact level of permissible scrap exports in that year was not yet
                        determined, although it was clear that such exports would not exceed the
                        1956 level and would probably be considerably lower. It was agreed at the
                        staff level that Commerce was requesting the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss> to anticipate and to prejudge the conclusions of a study
                        on the outlook for ferrous scrap in the United States before that study had
                        been completed. It was also agreed that the <gloss target="#t_ODM1"
                            >ODM</gloss> had been unable to determine in the absence of that study
                        whether or not the future availability of the scrap supply in the United
                        States would adversely affect this country’s national security.</p>
                    <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0655"/>
                    <p>Commerce representatives stated that the primary reason for requesting an
                        immediate <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> decision on this matter was
                        to enable Commerce to restrict the granting of export licenses so as to
                        prevent the major foreign purchasers from placing speculative orders in the
                        United States in anticipation of restrictive export quotas in calendar year
                        1957. Commerce also believed that the imposition of such licensing
                        restrictions would put the foreign purchasers on notice that scrap exports
                        would be curtailed by quota restrictions in 1957.</p>
                    <p>The Commerce representatives stated that since its last presentation to the
                            <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> no new facts had come to light
                        regarding the availability of ferrous scrap supplies in the United States.
                        About the only new interim developments were: (1) after the rise in steel
                        prices following the strike settlement, the average price of number 1
                        composite scrap had risen from about $53 or $54 a ton in the spring of 1956
                        to about $57 a ton at present; (2) the Japanese had already obtained
                        licenses for 2,035,000 tons, although they had stated their total
                        requirements for calendar year 1956 would be 1,800,000 tons; and (3) certain
                        domestic steel industry officials had recently made strong representations
                        to the Secretaries of Commerce and of Treasury for the imposition of export
                        quotas on ferrous scrap, primarily as a means of holding down the price of
                        steel scrap and hence that of finished steel production in this country.</p>

                            security, quotas on scrap, and had agreed (1) that strong
                            representations should be made to importing countries that export
                            controls would become necessary if they continued their imports of U.S.

                        restrictions should be placed on the licensing of exports of ferrous scrap
                        during the last quarter of calendar year 1956, primarily because (a) it is
                        doubtful whether the major foreign scrap purchasers in the United States
                        would engage in speculative buying during the next four months and thereby
                        jeopardize their scrap supply in the United States in later periods and (b)
                        if such speculative purchasing should occur, Commerce could amend by
                        administrative action the terms and conditions on which it issued licenses,
                        for example, shipments would have to be made within 30 days after issuance
                        rather than 90 days at present and the number and amount of unused licenses
                        held by scrap importers could be limited.</p>

                        consideration should be given to the exemption of exports to Canada and
                        Mexico, primarily because the economy of those countries is closely
                        associated with the United States, particularly in time of emergency
                        mobilization. Also, the quota for the United Kingdom should be raised to the
                        level of its stated requirements, that of 600,000 tons.<note n="6"

                            temporarily suspended licensing of exports of iron and steel scrap to

                            pending a review of U.S. policy on scrap exports. On April 30, 1957, the
                            Council agreed to a proposal by the Department of Commerce to suspend

                            scrap to Japan, the Coal and Steel Community, and the United Kingdom,
                            when licensing reached the level of 1956 shipments to each of these
                            areas. By June 30, 1957, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European
                            Coal and Steel Community had voluntarily agreed to limit their imports
                            of heavy melting grade steel scrap from the United States for 1957 to an

                    <p>On February 26, 1955, the Presidential Advisory Committee on Energy Supplies
                        and Resources Policy issued a report in which it stated its conclusion that
                        if the imports of crude oils should exceed significantly the proportion that
                        these imports bore to the production of domestic crude oil in 1954, the
                        domestic fuel situation could be so impaired as to endanger the orderly
                        industrial growth which affects the military and civilian supplies and
                        reserves that are necessary to the national defense.</p>
                    <p>In this report the Committee also recommended that the desirable
                        proportionate relationships between imports and domestic production be
                        reviewed from time to time in the light of industrial expansion and changing
                        economic and national defense requirements.</p>
                    <p>A short time ago the Advisory Committee decided to initiate a review of the
                        question of the desirable proportionate relationships between imports and
                        domestic production. The Committee requested the members of the task force
                        who participated in the development of the February 1955 report to assist in
                        making this review. The members of the task force are: <persName>James F.

                    <p>The members of the task force have looked at the problem in the light of
                        industrial expansion and current information relative to economic and
                        national defense requirements. They have met on two occasions with the

                                        domestic crude oil in those Districts in 1954</hi>.</p>
                                <p>Unless the objective is realized there will be in the period
                                    immediately ahead an impairment of our national security
                                    position because there will be an inadequate incentive for
                                    exploration and the discovery of new sources of supply.</p>
                                <p>The Committee believes that the deviation from the above policy
                                    reflected in the import programs announced for the third and
                                    fourth quarters of 1956 would constitute, if continued into
                                    1957, a threat to our national security.</p></item>

                        the importation of crude oil are to be achieved, it will be necessary,
                        taking into account the adjustment that is to be made in Venezuelan imports,
                        for all oil importers to reduce, on an individual voluntary basis, their
                        average level of imports in each quarter during 1957 of non-Canadian and
                        non-Venezuelan crude oil into Districts I–IV by 1 percent under their
                        average level of imports for the period of January to June 1956. This
                        determination takes into account the anticipated increase of 5 percent in
                        domestic production of crude oil in 1957, as estimated by the Department of
                        the Interior.</p>
                    <p>The Committee recognizes that it may be possible to devise methods for
                        reaching the objectives set forth in this report which, for example, would
                        deal more satisfactorily with the problem of how the new importers can be
                        provided with a share in the over-all import relationship. It has suggested,
                        therefore, to the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization that he
                        invite, in connection with the public hearings that are to be held on the
                        oil import problem beginning on October 22, interested parties to propose
                        any methods which, in their judgment, would help to achieve the objectives
                        set forth by the Committee in this report. The Committee will then give
                        these presentations careful consideration following the hearing and decide
                        whether or not such suggestions should be adopted.<note n="2"

                            Developments in the Near East</hi></p>
                    <p>Upon taking his place at the table, the President informed the Council that
                        the first item on the agenda was a discussion of the European oil supply
                        position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Robert B. Anderson</persName>,
                        former Deputy Secretary of Defense, would make a report to the Council, but
                        wished to leave the meeting after this subject had been discussed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> stated that he would
                        discuss three major aspects of the subject, beginning with an analysis of
                        the precise oil supply situation as of today. He informed the Council that
                        the Suez Canal was now thoroughly blocked by at least eight or nine ships
                        which had been sunk in it.<note n="2" xml:id="d232fn2">On October 29, Israel
                            invaded the Sinai and on October 30, Anglo-French forces bombarded
                            Egyptian installations. Passage through the Suez Canal was blocked on
                            November 1 when the British sank the Egyptian ship <hi rend="italic"
                                >Akka</hi> and that same day, Egypt broke diplomatic relations with
                            the United Kingdom and France. On November 3, sabotage closed the Iraq
                            Petroleum Company pipelines from Iraq to the Mediterranean.</note> The
                        Iraq pipeline had been sabotaged and three of its pumping stations
                        destroyed. The Aramco tapline was still intact, but it was touch-and-go as
                        to how long it would remain in operation. In the light of these
                        developments, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that
                        our first requirement will be for 350,000 barrels of oil a day to be
                        delivered from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast of the United States. In
                        addition, there will be a requirement of 450,000 barrels daily from
                        Venezuela and from our Gulf Coast for Europe. Only approximately 700,000
                        barrels of oil a day can be generated from the Gulf Coast. With maximum use
                        of all free world shipping, perhaps 800,000 barrels of oil can move each day
                        from the Middle East around the Cape to Europe. Even if all these
                        potentialities are realized, Europe would still be faced with a deficit of
                        between 10 and 15% of its requirements. On the other hand, if we lost
                        control of the Aramco tapline or fail to secure oil from the Middle East in
                        the amounts mentioned above via the Cape route, the deficit in Europe would
                        increase rapidly above the 10 to 15% level.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>, who had been working
                        with the oil companies, then informed the Council of the availability of
                        crude and refined products in Europe at the present time. There was
                        approximately <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0661"/>two weeks’ crude
                        supply, and approximately a month to six weeks’ supply of refined products
                        on hand. The American oil companies estimate that it will take something
                        between six months and a year to rehabilitate the Iraq petroleum company’s
                        pipeline, including the destroyed pumping stations. The British believe that
                        this task can be accomplished sooner.</p>
                    <p>The second major aspect of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName>’s report concerned the dollar problem. If the
                        European nations were to secure oil from the United States and Venezuela to
                        make up the deficit, this will require the generation of dollars. Prices for
                        crude oil are rising rapidly, but not as rapidly as prices for shipping oil
                        in tankers.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> then reminded the Council
                        that some months ago the Middle East Emergency Committee of industry
                        personnel had been set up under the Office of Defense Mobilization, to make
                        plans for the control of shipment of oil from the Gulf Coast to Europe in
                        the event of an interruption of normal Middle Eastern supplies. There were
                        British and French counterparts to the Middle East Emergency Committee. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> added that the
                        Organization for European Economic Cooperation (<gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                            >OEEC</gloss>), composed of seventeen European countries, had recently
                        met and made the following four recommendations to the seventeen member
                        governments: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>

                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>A recommendation for the equitable distribution of such petroleum

                            <item>A recommendation that rationing machinery be set up in each of the
                                member countries.</item>

                            <item>A recommendation that each country establish a petroleum advisory
                                committee to advise each government on the relevant problems.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> then informed the Council
                        that differences of opinion existed among the heads of our American oil
                        companies with respect to the best means of dealing with the present crisis.
                        Many believed that the United States Government should not act in the matter
                        of assisting to get oil to the European countries until the situation in the
                        Suez Canal had been clarified. Others were concerned that U.S. Government
                        participation in getting oil to Europe would be regarded by the Arab nations
                        as tantamount to U.S. support for aggression against Egypt. To make matters
                        worse, as of yesterday the Government of Saudi Arabia had prohibited the
                        offloading of any ships with oil destined for the United Kingdom or for
                        France. This government was also planning other measures with respect to
                        Bahrein Island, which was under a British mandate. Accordingly, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> pointed out that if we
                        now proceeded to implement the program developed by the Middle East
                        Emergency Committee, such action would be regarded by the Arabs as U.S.
                        participation in the aggression against them. While there was little doubt
                        that we could get oil to Great Britain and France by the simple
                        collaboration of the American oil companies without invoking the program
                        outlined by the Middle East Emergency <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630"
                            facs="0662"/>Committee, this course of action might invite difficulties
                        under the existing anti-trust laws of the United States. In essence, said
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>, this constituted the
                        issue which the Council would have to consider.<note n="3" xml:id="d232fn3"
                                ><persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> met on November
                            4 with <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SFA1"
                                >Seaton</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>,
                                <persName>Adams</persName>, Goodpaster, and several others. It was
                            decided that no initiative should be taken to activate the Middle East
                            Emergency Committee despite the sabotage of three Iraq Petroleum pumping
                            stations in Syria on November 3. <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> wrote in part: “The main objection to taking
                            initiative today was that since it would entail close cooperation with
                            the British and French, our moral position might be impaired at a most
                            critical moment and great damage done to our present position,
                            particularly with the Asian and African countries. Furthermore, it was
                            felt that one of the best cards we had to bring the British and French
                            to take a constructive position was the way we handled the oil matter.
                            If we rushed into cooperation with them, we would be perhaps giving away
                            a vital card. The chairman summed it up by saying he understood the
                            consensus of the matter to be that we should play hard-to-get and let
                            the initiative come from the European countries.” (Department of State,
                            Central Files, 840.04/11–455)</note></p>
                    <p>The President first inquired whether any oil could be got from Sumatra or
                        elsewhere in Indonesia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        replied that some oil was produced from Sumatra, but most of the 350,000
                        barrels a day which landed on our Pacific Coast came from the Middle
                        East.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        whether he could take any action to increase U.S. oil production for a
                        period of six months, making it perfectly clear that there would be a
                        cut-back after this interval. Or, asked the President, would the independent
                        oil companies make a terrible fuss when the cut-back was instituted at the
                        end of the six-months period? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> replied that this would be very difficult indeed to
                        do, and suggested that it would be better for the oil companies, rather than
                        the Government, to call for an increase in U.S. production.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President inquired how the oil companies were in a position to make
                        a significant increase in oil production in as short a time as six months.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> replied that in point of
                        fact the <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0663"/>increase could be achieved
                        very promptly. The President agreed, but wondered whether, if this were done
                        and the price of oil rose, there wasn’t danger that the stripper wells would
                        come back into production. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> answered that in any event we could anticipate that
                        the independent oil operators would charge that the Government always bailed
                        out the big companies whenever they got into trouble. Moreover, he added,
                        the independents would be airing this complaint at a time when the Congress
                        would be in session.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested that what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> was looking for was some means by which to secure
                        an increase promptly in U.S. oil production without at the same time getting
                        the United States in a position, in the eyes of the Arab world, of bailing
                        out the British and the French. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> agreed, and said that the real question was simply
                        whether we invoke the program drawn up by the Middle East Emergency
                        Committee or not. The President stated that as he saw it, just as soon as a
                        cease-fire was achieved in Egypt the Arab states will all be eager to sell
                        their oil again, since this was the main source of their revenues. The
                        President then inquired whether anyone else around the Council table had any
                        different ideas to contribute.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> observed that no
                        matter what happened there was bound to be an oil shortage of some months’
                        duration in Western Europe. It was his suggestion that we set about ensuring
                        increased production of oil in the United States without immediately
                        disclosing what we propose to do to assist Great Britain and France.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> prophesied that the
                        rationing of petroleum may soon be required in Great Britain. Both the
                        British and the French are extremely anxious to know what the United States
                        proposes to do. If we do not inform them, the British and French may insist
                        on holding on to every bit of oil available to them, and permit the shipment
                        of none of this oil to other European nations to whom they normally would
                        make such shipments. The President wondered whether it would not be possible
                        to ensure the shipment of necessary oil to the neutral nations of Western
                        Europe (excluding Great Britain and France) without arousing the wrath of
                        the Arabs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> replied that
                        this would be very difficult because most of the other European nations do
                        not have sufficient facilities to receive and store large amounts of
                        petroleum at any one time.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> commented that the
                        Department of State had a very vital concern in this whole problem. In fact,
                        hours and days are vital in getting this operation started. Even if we begin
                        to increase U.S. oil production right now, it will still be very difficult
                        to move that oil earlier than a period of fifteen to thirty days. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> predicted that there was
                        going to be harsh rationing in Europe, which was bound to give rise to
                        extreme anti-American <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0664"/>feeling there
                        on the ground that we will not seem to have done what is plainly in the
                        vital interests of Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>The President interposed the observation that anything that succeeds in
                        stopping the present hostilities in the Near East was very much in the vital
                        interests of Great Britain and France. In reply, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> pointed out that the British and
                        French have agreed to get out of Egypt as soon as the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> police forces move in. Moreover, the United States is ready,
                        as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> had stated in
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, to transport the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> police forces to Egypt. Accordingly, it was
                        absolutely crucial, in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName>’s opinion, to get the necessary increase in U.S. oil
                        production. He then advocated use of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                            >OEEC</gloss> machinery just as soon as possible. Use of the <gloss
                            target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> machinery would, he believed, avoid the
                        appearance that the United States was focusing attention on oil supplies
                        solely for Britain and France. Furthermore, it should be possible for us to
                        go to King Saud and promise him that none of his oil would go to France or
                        Great Britain and that no British or French ships would go into his ports.
                        In conclusion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>
                        again suggested that operations start immediately.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> informed the Council that
                        if the program devised by the Middle East Emergency Committee should now go
                        into operation, it will operate under the approval of the Secretary of the
                        Interior. Accordingly, the U.S. Government would be provided with an
                        opportunity to control the schedules of shipments. We could, furthermore,
                        use the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> machinery to guide us in
                        making decisions as to the appropriate distribution of oil going to
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> agreed with Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>, but warned that we
                        could not start this kind of operation without clearly indicating that the
                        United States was right in the middle of it. Accordingly, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said, he was opposed to
                        doing anything more than taking the steps which Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> had earlier suggested. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> pointed out that the
                        United States and Canada were, so to speak, associate members of <gloss
                            target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>. Any way you looked at it, he went on,
                        there was bound to be a shortage of oil in Western Europe. The real
                        question, therefore, was whether we prefer to let this shortage increase
                        over a period of time, or immediately involve the United States Government
                        in the problem by putting into action the program devised by the Middle East
                        Emergency Committee.</p>
                    <p>The President reiterated his point that the vital problem now was to induce
                        Egypt to agree to a cease-fire. To do this will be much more difficult if we
                        presently announce that we are going to get oil to Great Britain and France.
                        While this was very hard on the State Department, it was true just the same.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> replied that we had
                        just sent a message to President Nasser through <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                            >Dag Hammerskjöld</persName>
                        <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0665"/>last evening, a message which we do
                        not believe Nasser is in a position to turn down.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d232fn4">No copy of this message has been found in the
                            Department of State files. During a conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AWPJ1">W. Park Armstrong</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Henry Cabot Lodge</persName> on November 7,
                            however, <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> stated that
                            he had that evening sent a message to Nasser concerning the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> force.</note> Accordingly, we believe
                        that we will have the Egyptian situation under control within the next 24 to
                        36 hours. In view of this, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName> stated his belief that the program of the Middle East
                        Emergency Committee should now be predicated on the likelihood of immediate
                        success for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> took a different
                        position, and recommended against any move involving the U.S. Government
                        which would impair this Government’s bargaining position at the present
                        moment. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> agreed with
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, who went on to
                        state that the situation should be left alone for a little while. He warned
                        that the British and French will soon be urging that the United States
                        ration petroleum supplies as only fair if these countries have to resort to
                        rationing. This would cause a lot of trouble for this Government.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said he was sure
                        that the committee of private oil industry people would secure greater
                        efficiency in the matter of shipping oil. On the other hand, he believed
                        that the most unfortunate aspect of this whole crisis was the clarity with
                        which it pointed to a serious lack in the logistics system of the Western
                        powers. It indicates to the Arabs what a singularly strong position they are
                        in by virtue of their control of so much oil in the world. Accordingly, the
                        United States would have to do what it could for Europe in the near future,
                        but not at the present moment; that is, not until the British and French
                        Governments have got back into a position of compliance with the directives
                        of the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that if we really get the Arabs sore at all of us,
                        they could embargo all oil, which would ruin our present Middle East
                        Emergency Committee plan which still counts on some 800,000 barrels of oil
                        daily front Middle East sources. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> agreed, and said that furthermore, if the Arabs got
                        sore enough, we could also lose what we are now getting from the Aramco
                        tapline. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> thought it
                        would not be amiss if the State Department talked to Ibn Saud and asked him
                        to what countries he was willing that his oil be sent. After all, Saud is,
                        in a certain sense, cutting off his nose to spite his face when he threatens
                        to cut off oil presently going to Bahrein. The British and French get very
                        little of their oil from Bahrein Island. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> commented that he had received
                        another useful suggestion from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName>, namely, <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0666"
                        />that if our European friends come here to Washington in the next ten days,
                        we should invite King Ibn Saud to visit us after their departure. The
                        President expressed approval of this proposal, and pointed out
                        philosophically that the way of the peacemaker is proverbially hard. For
                        this reason he believed that the first thing to do is to try to avoid
                        aggravating either side in the controversy any further. If all of this was
                        an hour-by-hour proposition, the President believed we would be best advised
                        to let our Middle East Emergency Committee study further action. With a
                        smile, the President added that despite his stiff-necked Attorney General,
                        he could give the industry members a certification that what they were
                        planning and doing was in the interests of the national security. This might
                        assist them with respect to any involvement with the anti-trust laws.</p>
                    <p>The President asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>
                        if he had any objections to such a course of action. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> replied in the affirmative, and
                        said that he would prefer to see us do only what Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> had earlier suggested, namely, to
                        open up our coastwise shipment of oil to all foreign-flag vessels and to
                        undertake to increase oil production in the Gulf area. For the time being,
                        however, he would oppose programming oil shipments to Europe. The Emergency
                        Committee’s program could be got in readiness to move just as soon as the
                        gong sounded and the British and French evidenced compliance with the orders
                        of the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> stressed the matter
                        of timing, and said our decision would have to be based primarily on a feel
                        for public relations; that is, on when this Government believed it could
                        move with due regard to Arab opinion on the one hand and the British and
                        French viewpoint on the other.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> stated that he would put
                        the machinery into operation. He pointed out that foreign-flag tankers could
                        then carry oil from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast. Thereafter, when the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> police force has been installed in
                        Egypt, we will go on from this point to effectuate the program of the Middle
                        East Emergency Committee. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> followed up his proposal with a statement of the
                        crude oil inventory of the chief Western European nations.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> warned that we must
                        avoid thinking that we can deal with the Arabs as we would deal with
                        businessmen. The Arabs are moved by emotion and not by the judgments of
                        businessmen.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> pointed out, with
                        respect to the money and dollar aspect of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1"
                            >Anderson</persName>’s earlier report, that the French have already come
                        over here some three weeks ago and have arranged with the International
                        Monetary Fund to pull out all their gold and dollars. They have already
                        drawn on these to the limit. Overtures from the British suggest that they
                        will presently follow the French <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0667"
                        />example. To Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> it
                        seemed clear that if the United Kingdom did not look out, it would bust
                        itself to a point of bankruptcy and of no return.</p>
                    <p>The President remarked with a sigh that he wished we could have a complete
                        history of this cabal in which the British and the French were involved. A
                        step-by-step analysis of what they had done would be very illuminating…
                        .</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> commented that the
                        Anglo-French cabal had not only “kidded” the United States; it had also
                        kidded the nations of the British Commonwealth and, to some extent, the
                        British public too… . The President agreed, and stated that this Government
                        officially should keep out of the oil supply problem until we were assured
                        that the cease-fire was in effect.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> said that he felt
                        compelled to state that it was difficult to encourage the oil companies to
                        do their best, in view of their great anxiety about violation of the
                        anti-trust laws if they followed a course that we suggested was in the
                        national security interest. The President said with a smile that if the
                        heads of these oil companies landed up in jail or had to pay a big fine, he
                        would pardon them (laughter).</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General said that at the very least we owed it to these people
                        to have a representative of the United States Government work with them. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> warned that he was not an
                        official of the U.S. Government. To this the Attorney General replied that
                        it would then be necessary to have a representative of the Department of the
                        Interior work with the committee. We owed this, in all fairness, to the
                        committee. The President said that this was OK with him, and asked that
                            <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> or Interior make the necessary
                        arrangements.</p>

                    <p>At the conclusion of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                        >Hoover</persName>’s report, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1"
                            >Jackson</persName> indicated that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> would report briefly on the oil situation in
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that after last
                        week’s discussion of this problem in the National Security Council, he and
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Robert Anderson</persName> (former Deputy
                        Secretary of Defense) had conferred at once with the presidents of the major
                        oil companies. They had explained to these presidents our policies in this
                        area, and the presidents had expressed themselves as in accord with our
                        decisions. They favored at a later date pooling their shipping resources,
                        which they regard as much more efficient than the individual action of each
                        oil company, as was now the case.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> added that in this
                        discussion it had been agreed that the time had not yet come to put into
                        operation the plans for supplying oil to Europe drawn up by the Middle East
                        Emergency Committee. Nevertheless, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> recommended that the basic data on the oil
                        situation available to the Committee should be brought up to date. There had
                        been nothing new added in the last couple of weeks. This basic data, as to
                        the problem of getting oil to Europe, could be obtained quietly and
                        indirectly from the British and French through the agency of the
                        Organization for European <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0669"/>Economic
                        Cooperation (<gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>). Once we have this
                        additional basic data, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>
                        indicated, we would be able to move very quickly when the time came to put
                        the Middle East Emergency Committee plan into effect. It should also be
                        possible to sound out the Saudi Arabians on their reaction to our effort to
                        supply oil to Europe.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> stated that it would
                        be impossible for a few days to sound out the Saudi Arabian attitude,
                        because King Saud was momentarily out of his country. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> then described a story printed in
                        last night’s Washington Star, alleging that the United States Government was
                        actually withholding oil supplies from Great Britain and France in order to
                        force them to comply with the decisions of the United Nations. This
                        erroneous story, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName>, would have the most unfortunate effect when it
                        became known in Europe, as it certainly would. The European nations would
                        all descend on us to blame us for their shortages. For this reason, if for
                        no other, this Government, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName>, has got to move into the European oil situation in a
                        short time, not later than a day or two.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he had thought we had already determined to let
                        Venezuelan oil go to Europe. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName> replied that while this was so, the problem was the
                        availability of tankers to get the Venezuelan oil to Europe, and that, of
                        course, if the companies attempted to pool their ships, they would run afoul
                        of the antitrust law. The President made a jocular reference to his
                        “stiff-necked” Attorney General, and after Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> had insisted that we would have to
                        organize the pooling of tankers along the lines suggested by the Middle East
                        Emergency Committee plan, the President again offered to make a public
                        statement which might help the oil companies by declaring that their pooling
                        activities were the result of a serious emergency situation.</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General reassured the President that the Department of Justice
                        already had a plan of action in this situation which could be put into
                        effect as soon as the State Department told him to do so. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> confirmed this statement, and
                        added that the Department of Justice was showing admirable cooperation. He
                        explained that he was really not much worried about the legal angle. The
                        President observed that we must certainly use every legal recourse to meet
                        the situation. Above all, we want to increase the flow of oil from the Gulf
                        Coast to our own East Coast, so that more Venezuelan oil can go directly to
                        Europe. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> informed the
                        President that this was already being done.</p>
                    <p>There then ensued a discussion of the problem of pooling tankers. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> elucidated the dilemma.
                        If the oil companies pooled their tankers and this fact became known, the
                            <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0670"/>Arabs could be expected to cut
                        off further oil supplies. Accordingly, we might be worse off than as though
                        there had been no pooling. Despite the gain in efficiency by pooling the
                        tankers, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> therefore
                        opposed such a move at the present time. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> expressed the opinion that if the oil companies did
                        pool their tankers, it would be impossible to disguise the fact that such a
                        move had been suggested by the U.S. Government.</p>
                    <p>The President said it was his conclusion that it was best to go along with
                        the recommendations made by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> earlier in the discussion, namely, to get the basic
                        data available to the Middle East Emergency Committee up to date, and to
                        find out what the Saudi Arabians would do if they were to learn that we
                        proposed to ship oil to Europe under the terms of the Middle East Emergency
                        Committee plan.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed out that the
                        Russians were already supplying oil to Egypt and were in general moving into
                        the situation there. He warned that we may have to move ourselves very
                        promptly, not only in Egypt but in Syria.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> inquired whether the
                        consensus of the Council could be summed up in the following terms: First,
                        that we would proceed to bring our basic data for the Middle East Emergency
                        Committee up to date; and second, ask the State Department to sound out the
                        Saudi Arabians on their reaction to our plans, before any action is taken by
                        us.</p>
                    <p>The discussion closed with a new expression of great anxiety over Britain’s
                        financial and economic situation from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"

                    <head>234. Editorial Note</head>
                    <p>In mid-November 1956, officials in both the French and British Governments
                        stressed that the oil situation in their countries as a result of the
                        blockage of the Suez Canal and the closure of the Iraq Petroleum Company
                        pipelines was extremely serious. They argued that failure by the United
                        States and other countries to take measures to supply Western Europe with
                        the oil it needed in the coming months would precipitate grave social,
                        political, and economic repercussions. (Memorandum of conversation by Tyler,
                        November 17, relating his conversation with the French Ambassador; for text,
                        see <ref target="frus1955-57v13#pg_605">volume XIII, page 605</ref>) They
                        claimed that by the middle of the month, their supplies of oil had dropped
                        25 to 30 percent below their normal needs. (Telegram 2810 from London,
                        November 19, and telegram 2474 from Paris, November 19; both in Department
                        of State, Central Files, 840.04/11–1956) Moreover, they charged that
                        American hesitancy to cooperate with them in meeting their oil deficit was a
                        means of putting pressure on the two governments to withdraw their forces
                        from Egypt as well as an imposition of needless hardship on their countries.
                        (Telegram 2496 from Paris, November 20; <hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>
                        840.04/11–2056; telegram 2597 from Paris, November 26; <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>Until the end of the month, the United States Government remained unwilling
                        to ease the oil shortage in Europe by activating the plan of action prepared
                        by the Middle East Emergency Committee for two reasons. One reason was not
                        to give any impression of supporting British and French action against
                        Egypt, especially as <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0672"/>such an
                        impression would have impaired the position of the United States in the
                        United Nations. Another was to avoid any impression that could have led Arab
                        oil-producing States either to sabotage additional facilities or impose
                        additional restrictions on the use of oil. (Circular telegram 411, November
                        17; <hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 840.04/11–1756) Throughout the month,
                        however, the United States Government continued to assure Great Britain and
                        France that the United States was willing to supply oil to Europe if those
                        two countries complied with the United Nations resolutions on the Suez
                        crisis and withdrew their forces from Egypt. (Message from <persName
                            corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"

                            >Ibid.,</hi> 840.04/11–2756) The United States Government also urged
                        American and European oil suppliers to cooperate through the Organization
                        for European Economic Cooperation to achieve the maximum possible efficiency
                        of supply and an equitable sharing of shortages.</p>

                        Friday. As you surmise, we have had reports from our representatives who
                        attended the meeting. Their report coincides with yours on the three points
                        you mentioned, namely, agreement to recommend to member governments that
                        consumption of oil in Europe be reduced immediately by 10 percent; agreement
                        that national industry committees would furnish stock and future supply data
                        to the Oil Emergency (London) Advisory Committee; and the desire of
                        consuming countries in Europe to see more active American participation in
                        planning to cope with the prospective oil problem.</p>
                    <p>We believe the steps which the European countries have decided to take in the
                        matter of reducing consumption and evaluating the present situation are both
                        prudent and warranted in the circumstances. <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641"
                            facs="0673"/>We have noted the view expressed in the <gloss
                            target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> Oil Committee regarding United States
                        participation in the planning to cope with the situation.</p>
                    <p>When I spoke to you recently regarding the ability of oil companies
                        individually to solve the problems they face in continuing supplies to
                        Europe with the Suez Canal closed I did not of course mean to suggest that
                        their efforts would be equally as efficient whether or not coordinated. I am
                        certain, however, that the companies individually will be highly effective
                        in devising measures to cope with the problems they face. The lesser
                        efficiency of the uncoordinated effort seems to me preferable to a
                        coordinated effort if as a result of the latter there should be additional
                        adverse reactions in the oil producing states similar to those which have
                        already been experienced and which would compound rather than ease the
                        present difficulties.</p>
                    <p>To acknowledge this preference in considering how to cope with the oil supply
                        situation in Europe is not to express disinterest in the problem. The United
                        States Government is deeply concerned with the problem of oil supplies to
                        Europe. We are following the situation very closely in order that in our
                        appraisal of the problem we may weigh all factors pertinent to our decisions
                        in this field.</p>

                    <p>In the course of his call upon the Acting Secretary this morning Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Cosgrave</persName> raised the question of
                        the Middle East crisis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>
                        said that we were passing through difficult times and that <pb n="643"
                            xml:id="pg_643" facs="0675"/>while we regret that we have had to differ
                        with our traditional allies on this matter, we have every reason to believe
                        that once certain steps have been taken to proceed to a solution of the
                        problem that our alliance will grow even stronger. In this matter we have
                        acted according to our conscience. The British and French action in Egypt
                        has had the unfortunate effect which we had earlier predicted, namely, it
                        invites Soviet penetration of the area and serves to build up Nasser’s
                        prestige. We have no great fondness for Nasser nor his actions with respect
                        to the Suez Canal and we believe that the other Arab countries feel the same
                        way. Unfortunately, the British and French action only served to unify the
                        Arabs.</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Cosgrave</persName> said that the Irish
                        Government was in complete agreement with the United States on this issue
                        and felt that the British and French action had been most unwise. He
                        referred then to the growing seriousness of the oil situation in Europe and
                        said that rationing of oil in Ireland will begin in January. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> then recited some of the background
                        of the oil question, pointing out that the problem is one of transportation
                        and not a shortage of oil. With the Suez Canal closed and all but one
                        pipeline out of action, Europe will be faced with an oil problem for some
                        time to come. The Tapline from Saudi Arabia is mined for much of its length
                        and could be sabotaged at any time. This Tapline supplies about 300 thousand
                        barrels a day and if the line were to be put out of commission it would
                        require an additional 170 tankers to carry that amount of oil around Africa
                        to Europe. The Minister would understand the delicacy of this situation.
                        Once the situation is stabilized in Egypt work can be commenced on the
                        clearing of the Canal. The British informed us that it should be possible to
                        clear a 25-foot channel in the Canal in a matter of 30 days or so, although
                        our own Navy is inclined to think it might take longer. To clear the Canal
                        to its normal operating depth would require possibly several months. In any
                        event, a clearing to a 25-foot depth would permit approximately 70 per cent
                        of the Canal traffic to resume transit through the Canal. This question of
                        oil supply is of course of vital importance to Europe but it will also
                        affect the entire world in one way or another. Due to the delicate situation
                        in the Arab countries, particularly in connection with the Tapline, we have
                        not been able to move to aid the United Kingdom and France until they comply
                        with the United Nations resolutions on the Suez crisis. If they will
                        announce publicly their plans to withdraw and these plans are acceptable to
                        the Secretary General of the United Nations, we will be able to move forward
                        rapidly.</p>
                    <p>The Acting Secretary said that the United States has felt all along in this
                        crisis that it is not right for members of the United Nations to take the
                        law into their own hands. This would only <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644"
                            facs="0676"/>encourage others to do likewise. He remarked that the
                        British-French action has, unfortunately, given the Soviet Union an “out” in
                        connection with its recent actions in Hungary and has served to distract
                        attention from that tragic situation.</p>

                    <p>On November 30, the United States Government authorized activation of the
                        Middle East Emergency Committee (<gloss target="#t_MEEC1">MEEC</gloss>). On
                        November 25, the President had agreed with Acting Secretary of State
                            <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> that they could not wait
                        any longer to set up the <gloss target="#t_MEEC1">MEEC</gloss> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> was given the responsibility. At
                        the National Security Council meeting on November 30, <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> reported that his committee had
                        recommended announcing the decision to put the emergency plan into action
                        immediately because it could be done without jeopardizing United Nations
                        efforts to obtain a withdrawal and without offending Arab nations.</p>
                    <p>By activating the <gloss target="#t_MEEC1">MEEC</gloss>, the United States
                        Government authorized 15 American oil companies to coordinate the efforts
                        they had been making individually to assist in handling the oil supply
                        problem resulting from the closing of the Suez Canal and pipeline stoppages.
                        It also allowed immunity from application of anti-trust laws which had
                        prohibited company coordination without government authorization. The
                        companies were subsequently permitted to work through the Organization for
                        European Economic Cooperation (<gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>) and
                        its subordinate committees in the implementation of these plans. On December
                        7, the Department of the Interior approved the first two schedules of
                        revised shipments submitted by the <gloss target="#t_MEEC1">MEEC</gloss>
                        under which certain Western Hemisphere and Middle East shipments usually
                        delivered to the Western Hemisphere ports were rerouted to Europe and other
                        areas of shortage, and other Middle East shipments were also rerouted for
                        greater efficiency. (Circular telegram 483, December 8; Department of State,

                    <p>458. Joint State–<gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> message. From press
                        and radio accounts there seems to be need for more accurate information in
                        Europe regarding the causes leading to the shortage of petroleum products.
                        In a number of accounts which have come to our attention the problem was
                        reduced to a simple formula of American unwillingness to provide oil.
                        Obviously it is oversimplified, misleading and harmful to pose the problem
                        in these terms. While it is expected that European criticism will diminish
                        at least for awhile now that the Middle East Emergency Committee is being
                        reactivated it may revive as the shortages continue. It is desired therefore
                        that Public Affairs Officers in the respective missions endeavor through
                        background briefings and off the record conversations with key
                        correspondents and broadcasters to convey to the public a better
                        comprehension of the nature of the problem.</p>
                    <p>It is not the purpose of this circular to attach blame for what has happened
                        but to place the matter in proper perspective. Europe’s oil supply comes
                        largely from the Middle East. Incident to recent military operations the
                        Egyptians sank numerous vessels and destroyed installations in the Suez
                        Canal preventing free passage. In addition certain pipelines feeding into
                        the Mediterranean were sabotaged. As a result of these developments there
                        has been created a serious transportation problem in respect to the delivery
                        of petroleum because there is not a sufficient number of tankers to deliver
                        oil over the longer route which must be followed in view of the closure of
                        the Suez Canal and the loss of certain pipelines in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>The problem basically is a transportation problem and not a problem of
                        adequate oil supplies. If we had sufficient transportation facilities the
                        accessible producing areas in the Persian Gulf and the Western Hemisphere
                        are adequate to cover the present demand for petroleum. In this connection
                        the one pipeline from Saudia Arabia to the eastern Mediterranean which
                        continues in operation is of particular importance in supplying the
                        Mediterranean area. If this were destroyed as many as 200 additional tankers
                        would be required to move the same quantity of oil around the Cape of Good
                        Hope to the <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0678"/>Mediterranean as are
                        now required. If this line had been lost as a result of a reaction to a
                        premature activation of the Middle East Emergency Committee it would not
                        have been possible in a subsequent coordinated effort to improve the supply
                        available beyond what the uncoordinated efforts have been producing.</p>
                    <p>The following numerical data may be of some interest in discussing the
                        problem. Currently the Eastern Hemisphere west of Suez has been using three
                        million barrels per day of crude oil. 2.2 million b/d came from the Middle
                        East, 475,000 from the Western Hemisphere, 200,000 from local sources and
                        60,000 b/d from the Soviet bloc. Middle East deliveries to this area will
                        now be limited to the 320,000 b/d from the trans-Arabian pipeline and about
                        800,000 b/d around the Cape of Good Hope. Western Hemisphere deliveries are
                        expected to increase by about 500,000 b/d over normal deliveries. The
                        indicated shortage is therefore approximately 20 percent. As soon as it is
                        possible to restore some of the Middle East pipeline capacity or to make use
                        of the Suez Canal this shortage would be substantially reduced and possibly
                        eliminated.</p>

                        that the US favors Nasser, ignores the needs of its friends and allies and

                        economic political social and military impact of an oil shortage in Europe.
                        Throughout the negotiations regarding the Suez Canal which began last July
                        the US has pointed to the very problems which have now developed. In
                        addition to the physical problems of oil supply which are involved there is
                        an acute financial problem to be faced if the shortages persist for long. If
                        a considerable portion of Europe’s oil supply is shifted from a sterling to
                        a dollar basis there will be a serious impact on the financial situation of
                        certain European countries. While we are hopeful that their own resources
                        will permit their meeting the financial problem for awhile we would
                        anticipate the possibility of discussions between governments regarding the
                        financial aspects should this later be necessary. It is urged that the Chief
                        of Mission give this matter his personal attention and the staff members
                        especially the public affairs officers devote their best efforts to creating
                        a better understanding of the problems involved on the part of the
                        authorities and the public in their respective countries.</p>

                                Oil<note n="2" xml:id="d240fn2">This memorandum, not printed, was
                                the result of preliminary studies by various departments of the
                                British Government on the long-term problems of transporting rapidly
                                increasing quantities of oil from the Middle East. It included the
                                problem of ensuring against interruption of oil supplies and
                                suggested preliminary steps for the further consideration of these
                                problems. It concluded that collaboration between the United States
                                at the company and the government level was essential in order to
                                secure: 1) an assessment of the plans of oil shipowning and
                                shipbuilding interests worldwide; 2) an agreed basis for settling
                                priorities as between the canal pipelines and tankers, and for
                                deciding the extent to which any scheme of insurance is desirable or
                                possible; 3) broad agreement on the proportion of the various types
                                of tankers which might be needed; 4) an appreciation of the
                                productive capacity and of steel availability for tankers and
                                pipelines; and 5) an appreciation of the capital required for the
                                transport of oil on the scale envisaged and of the extent to which
                                these requirements, together with the requirements of the oil
                                industry for the development of production, refining, and
                                distribution, could be met by traditional methods. A copy of the
                                memorandum is <hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> PPS Files: Lot 67 <gloss

                    <p>The subject of the memorandum is most important. It warrants the prompt
                        attention by governments and oil companies which the British suggest.
                        Defense, Interior, <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> and State are
                        importantly concerned with the issues which are raised.</p>
                    <p>The problem could be solved if the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        oil companies were able and willing to build tankers sufficient in numbers
                        to bypass the Canal. They are not. The solution depends in the main on
                        political arrangements guaranteeing secure oil transit through pipelines in
                        the Middle East or through the Canal. The consequences of failure are also
                        political deriving from an undermining of the economies and military
                        position of Western Europe and our relations with this key area.</p>
                    <p>In view of the political factors mentioned, I believe that the U.S. position
                        should be worked out interdepartmentally under State Department
                        chairmanship. Other agencies such as <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>
                        could deal <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0680"/>with particular aspects
                        of the problem such as tankers. A case could be made for <gloss
                            target="#t_E1">E</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>, or <gloss
                            target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> chairmanship. I would favor either of the
                        latter in view of the predominance of political elements.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the transport considerations raised by the British I would
                        suggest broadening the study to include under Section VII<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d240fn3">This section was entitled “Recommendations for Future
                            Action.”</note> the question of guaranteeing adequate production of oil
                        in the Middle East. In another few years the production of single countries,
                        e.g. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in particular, will be so large that the loss
                        of any one will create difficult problems of replacing the lost supplies
                        especially as the Western Hemisphere may then be a net importer of oil.</p>

                                    <item>that to cope with the transportation problem a compromise
                                        be adopted between the three principal solutions, building
                                        up of the Suez Canal, construction or expansion of pipelines
                                        and construction of supertankers for the Cape route. The
                                        paper argues in this respect that in view of political risks
                                        involved Canal and pipelines should be expanded with
                                        caution. The <hi rend="italic">Canal</hi>—through which more
                                        than 1.5 million b/d were carried in 1956—should be built up
                                        only to a capacity of 3 million b/d (No. 18), in other words
                                        only the 8th improvement program of the old Canal Company
                                        should be carried out. This program had been started in
                                        December, 1954 and probably would have been finished long
                                        before 1965. The Company appeared to be willing to finance
                                        it without outside help. The pipelines through which 800,000
                                        to 900,000 b/d are moved now, should reach a total <pb
                                            n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0681"/>capacity of 1.6
                                        million b/d including the 400,000 b/d capacity of a line
                                        from Northern Iraq to Turkey. These ends, both as regards
                                        the Canal and the pipelines, would be achieved by 1965
                                        (which presumably means the end of that year). The remainder
                                        of West-bound Middle Eastern oil would have to move via the
                                        Cape. These shipments would increase from 400,000 b/d in
                                        1960 to 1.1 million b/d in 1965—and since Canal and pipeline
                                        development would stop at that time—rise rapidly to 3.3
                                        million or even 4.8 million b/d in 1970.</item>

                                <p>These rates represent an average rate of growth in oil
                                    consumption of 9% per annum (compound) during the period
                                    1955–1970, compared with a post war average of over 13 percent
                                    in <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> oil consumption from
                                    all sources. The British estimate of oil requirements for the
                                    decade 1960–1970 may, therefore, be on the conservative side.
                                    This is in marked contrast to the general tone of their paper
                                    which is to emphasize the enormity of Western requirements for
                                    Middle Eastern oil. It should be noted, however, that the
                                    British estimates for the 1960’s are higher than those of the
                                        <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> Oil Committee in their
                                    report of September 1956. For 1960, they are about 5% higher
                                    than the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>, while for 1970
                                    they use the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> forecast for
                                    1975. Nevertheless, we should explore with the British the basis
                                    for their assumption of a considerable decrease in the rate of
                                    growth in oil use during the 1960’s.</p>

                            <item>It would seem questionable, at first sight, whether to increase
                                the capacity of the Suez route beyond 3 million b/d, a second Canal
                                would have to be built (No. 19). However, the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                    >UK</gloss> view might be correct, after all, since not only
                                about 150 million tons of oil, but probably 30 to 40 million tons of
                                other west-bound goods would use—or try to use—the Canal by 1965.
                                Increasing quantities of dry cargo also are moving westward through
                                the Canal, amounting (in tons) to roughly speaking thirty percent of
                                the oil moved in the <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0682"/>same
                                direction. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> paper suggests
                                priorities in favor of the tankers (No. 19), a measure not devoid of
                                political risks. The statement that “the cost of moving oil through
                                the pipelines or through the Canal is, at present, roughly
                                equivalent” (No. 15) does not seem to be quite convincing. But
                                supposing all assumptions of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>’s
                                paper to be correct, many contingent problems need to be

                                        figure depends largely on the speed of the vessels which is
                                        assumed to be 16 knots (No. 21). It should be mentioned,
                                        however, that even now 20 knot tankers are being built
                                        (Petroleum Press Service, January 1957) and that the
                                        calculations of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> paper
                                        (mainly in No. 21) seem to be based on speeds of less than
                                        16 knots. The “additional requirements” therefore might be
                                        less than 25.5 million dwt.</item>

                                    <item>The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> paper (No. 21)
                                        expects an annual net increase in tanker tonnage of 3
                                        million dwt of which about 1 million dwt might be required
                                        for routes other than the route from the Middle East to
                                        destinations west of Suez. Other observers, however,
                                        estimate the deadweight tonnage of tankers on order or under
                                        construction in the Free World alone at 23.5 million dwt
                                        (Am. B. of Shipp., Bull, of Dec. 1956), or even 28.9 million
                                        dwt (Petroleum Press Service January 1957) as compared with
                                        an operable total of about 43 million dwt now. Fairplay,
                                        London (December 13, 1956) expects that 5.5 million dwt
                                        might be delivered in each of the next four years while
                                        scrappings would amount to about 750,000 dwt per year. If
                                        these estimates are correct, the net increase available to
                                        Suez-west routes would amount to 3.75 million dwt (5.5
                                        million minus 750,000 minus 1 million for “other” routes)
                                        and not to 2 million dwt. Between 1961 and 1965 tanker
                                        building capacity very probably will increase. But even
                                        assuming no such increase in capacity and output there would
                                        be hardly any world-wide tanker deficit by 1965 unless
                                        scrappings were greatly stepped up and “other” routes
                                        unexpectedly would require large additional tanker fleets.
                                        For the total increase of the Free World’s tanker fleet
                                        would amount to more than 30 million dwt (nine times
                                        3,750,000) as compared with “additional requirements” of

                                        endorse the assumption that super tankers of 60,000 dwt
                                        could be operated on the Cape route at a cost roughly
                                        comparable to that of operating 40,000 dwt tankers through
                                        the Canal (No. 15). It is not quite clear whether total
                                        costs or direct costs are meant. Considering the importance
                                        of wages as a cost factor, there would be a considerable
                                        difference between the costs of transportation in American
                                        flag and foreign flag tankers. Some thought also should be
                                        given to the routing of empty tankers through the Canal
                                        while moving them via the Cape when loaded.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said that he considered
                        that planning on the part of both the Government and the companies should
                        proceed simultaneously. On the Government side Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> of the Office of Defense
                        Mobilization would give the result of the Government’s study to the Middle
                        East Emergency Committee for study and comments. The “raw material” would be
                        passed on to the United Kingdom, following which we would expect a
                        round-robin at the Governmental level to coordinate policies.</p>
                    <p>There was some discussion regarding possible construction of a pipeline
                        through Turkey and of a construction program for large tankers. The
                        Ambassador said that the United Kingdom’s approach to this whole problem
                        differed in emphasis, to a certain degree, from that of the United States.
                        He said that the British Government could never again permit a situation to
                        arise which might jeopardize all of British industry; that the United
                        Kingdom could no longer rely <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0684"
                        />entirely on one sole source of oil supply. He pointed to certain
                        difficulties in connection with a large tanker construction program, saying
                        that if such a program is embarked upon there will need to be an expansion
                        and enlargement of port facilities. The companies operating the tankers
                        would of course expect the Government to carry out such port development.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said there had been some
                        question as to the optimum size of tankers and it seemed that 45,000 tons
                        was the most appropriate size for such vessels. In the case of 45,000 ton
                        tankers no changes in port facilities would be required but discharge time
                        would of course be increased. With reference to the Canal itself, we have
                        reports from certain oil companies to the effect that the proposal for
                        enlarging the Canal is greatly over-emphasized and that the Canal has never
                        really been used to capacity.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said that interested companies are pressing for the
                        conclusion of a treaty with respect to the proposed pipeline through Turkey.
                        He said that it might be desirable to conclude a treaty regarding oil
                        transport by such a pipeline but he felt that we could not go as far as to
                        propose a treaty which would guarantee continued exploitation of oil
                        resources. He felt that such a treaty would have a very difficult time
                        getting through the Senate which would be reluctant to approve an agreement
                        limiting any country’s ability to utilize its own resources to its best
                        advantage. If such a pipeline is the subject of a treaty it should be
                        considered as a public utility for use, on a regulated basis, by all oil
                        suppliers.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that he was somewhat anxious about the forthcoming visit
                        of King Saud of Saudi Arabia. He recalled that there are various unsettled
                        matters between the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia such as Buraimi and he
                        hoped that King Saud would not gain the impression during his visit to the
                        United States that he had U.S. support on all these matters. The Ambassador
                        said that he had no instructions on this matter but he thought it desirable
                        to raise it at this time. The Under Secretary said that we very much hoped
                        that we could get the Buraimi talks started again when things cooled off in
                        the Middle East and he reminded the Ambassador that the Saudis were more
                        willing to discuss this matter at one time than was the United Kingdom. The
                        Ambassador noted that the Iraqi and the Saudi Arabians seemed to be getting
                        together again and he wondered, in connection with the settlement of
                        boundary disputes, whether the United States could not give a formal
                        guarantee of the territorial integrity of these states once the boundaries
                        are fixed by agreement. When it was pointed out to the Ambassador that we
                        might have some difficulty from a Constitutional point of view, he said that
                        he had in mind a statement of some kind which would <pb n="653"
                            xml:id="pg_653" facs="0685"/>“view with the greatest concern” any
                        attempt to alter these boundaries by force.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said that we would do our best to try to restore peaceful
                        relations between the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia and he hoped after a
                        cooling off period that the two might gradually come together again. He
                        inquired concerning accounts of recent disturbances between the Aden
                        Protectorate and Yemen. The Ambassador said that he had no official accounts
                        of what had happened but that he understood the incidents had occurred on
                        the United Kingdom side of the border.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then referred to the problem of reopening the Canal and
                        procedures to be followed in setting up an administration of the Canal. He
                        referred to the fact that <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Eugene Black</persName>
                        of the International Bank had expressed the opinion that the $15 million
                        provided for the clearing of the Canal would not be sufficient and that it
                        might require some $30 or $40 million in all. He said that the question of
                        the payment and division of Canal tolls was of the utmost importance and he
                        wondered if it might not be wise for the International Bank to handle the
                        whole operation. He said that he had talked to Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> about this matter and that <persName
                            corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> had said that Hammarskjold should be
                        encouraged to work out this problem in negotiation with the Egyptians and
                        the users of the Canal.</p>

                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_CSH1">Harold Caccia</persName> said that he had two
                        questions relating to oil which he wished to discuss with the Under
                        Secretary. The first had <pb n="654" xml:id="pg_654" facs="0686"/>a bearing
                        on the document regarding long-term requirements for the transport of oil
                        from the Middle East which had been left at the Department on January 4<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d242fn2">See <ref target="#d240">Document
                            240</ref>.</note> and the other related to the present oil
                        situation.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Transport of Middle East Oil</hi></p>
                    <p>The British paper, minus two paragraphs, had been given to the Shell
                        Petroleum Company and the British Petroleum Company for their information
                        and views. Shell’s initial reaction had been one of some concern that the
                        British Government felt the matter required government interest in a subject
                        which the company considered to be within its competence. Shell had told the
                        British Government that invitations had gone out to American companies to
                        come to London to discuss the problem of transport of oil in the Middle
                        East. It was the hope of the British Government that the U.S. Government
                        would give any necessary green light to permit American companies to
                        participate in the discussion and that antitrust questions would not stand
                        in the way.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEG1">Moline</persName> said that he thought the
                        meeting in question was to discuss only a pipeline from Iraq to Turkey and
                        in this case would involve only the Iraq Petroleum Company. The Under
                        Secretary said he thought that consultation should be limited to the
                        companies having interests in <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>, in which
                        case no antitrust problems seemed to arise. In his view it would be a
                        mistake to widen the number of participants beyond those having a direct
                        interest in the immediate <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> project.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary referred to a previous conversation with Sir <persName
                            corresp="#p_CSH1">Harold</persName> and said that while he had
                        previously considered the desirability of bringing in an individual who
                        might work solely on the question of pipelines in the Middle East, he now
                        believed it would be better to handle the matter in diplomatic channels and
                        to approach Iraq and Turkey with the idea of some kind of treaty cover for a
                        pipeline convention which might be worked out between the pipeline company
                        and the governments concerned. He suggested that British Government and
                        Departmental legal experts might consider the question of an appropriate
                        treaty. It was clear that some kind of treaty cover would be necessary if
                        the company were to invest the very large sum which would be required in the
                        project in question and others which might follow. It was his view that the
                        pipeline itself should be a common carrier and have some kind of public
                        utility aspect even though as a practical matter the only oil available <pb
                            n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0687"/>in the near future to be carried in
                        the line would be <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> oil from Iraq.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">U.S. Oil Exports</hi></p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_CSH1">Harold</persName> noted the fact that the
                        most recent figures of U.S. oil exports to Europe had fallen sharply from
                        the previous week’s level and were most disappointing both in total and in
                        crude oil content. The Under Secretary said that he fully appreciated
                        Europe’s concern in this regard but that the problem was a very difficult
                        one. He referred to the fact that serious difficulties with respect to oil
                        imports were in prospect and that these were certain to be intensified if
                        U.S. production should be sharply expanded and then cut back drastically. He
                        referred to the efforts which had been made to solve the import problem on a
                        voluntary basis but noted that one or two companies do not subscribe to our
                        efforts to limit imports in this fashion. Other considerations, particularly
                        affecting Texas and related to its production capacity, also complicated the
                        problem. Nonetheless the U.S. Government was seeking to take steps which
                        could result in the export of more crude oil even though the steps would not
                        be as dramatic as a Texas decision to increase production. Such moves might
                        reduce crude runs and modify product yields. Companies had more than
                        adequate stocks of gasoline to draw on and it was hoped to use U.S. Naval
                        reserve stocks to guarantee the companies against fuel oil shortages, thus
                        permitting them to draw down fuel oil stocks below the levels which would be
                        considered prudent to cope with an unexpected cold snap.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said that Naval authorities in the U.S. were of the
                        opinion that British Admiralty stock might also be used in the same fashion
                        to permit a greater stock drawdown than might otherwise be possible in the
                        United Kingdom. Sir <persName corresp="#p_CSH1">Harold</persName> said he
                        would look into this matter and would have his Petroleum Attaché inform the
                        Department of the results of this investigation.</p>

                    <p>On January 31, 1957, the Council on Foreign Economic Policy deferred
                        consideration of a proposal made by the Department of the Interior to amend
                        the Council’s February 14, 1956, decision to limit supplemental stockpile
                        acquisitions. Consideration of this proposal, which would have permitted the
                        barter of agricultural surpluses for <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0688"
                        />tungsten, was delayed until after the Department of the Interior had
                        completed a study of the desirability of continuing the Council’s limitation
                        on all items in the supplemental stockpile. The Council’s records indicate
                        that no decision on Interior’s proposal was made in 1957. Documentation on

                        letter to United States importers of crude oil stating that when the Suez
                        crisis had ended, his office would have another look at the country’s crude
                        oil imports picture in order to determine if the national security was
                        substantially impaired by such imports. The letter asked each importing
                        company to submit an estimate of its imports planned for the 6-month period
                        immediately following the reopening of the Suez Canal or the Iraq Petroleum
                        Company pipeline, or both. On the basis of these estimates, the Office of
                        Defense Mobilization would determine whether the projected volume of imports
                        into United States Districts I–IV in the immediate post-Suez period would be
                        in line with permissible 1954 rations. If not, the office would request
                        revised estimates from the companies in an attempt to determine whether
                        Section 7 of the Trade Agreements Act should be applied to limit imports.
                        The letter also stated that in determining any action which might be taken
                        to limit oil imports into the United States, due consideration would be
                        given to using normal import patterns as a base period rather than emergency
                        diversions. (Department of State, Central Files, 411.006/3–857)</p>

                    <p>In London, March 18–20, the heads of the major American and European oil
                        companies held exploratory talks regarding the problems <pb n="657"
                            xml:id="pg_657" facs="0689"/>involved in the transport of Middle East
                        oil by new pipelines in the area.</p>
                    <p>Representatives of the British Embassy in Washington and the Department of
                        State prepared a joint position paper, dated March 16, entitled, “Guarantees
                        for Maintenance of Flow of Middle East Oil Through Pipelines,” for the talks
                        between President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and
                        British Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Harold
                            Macmillan</persName> at Bermuda, March 20–23. Acknowledging that greater
                        guarantees for oil pipeline operations would be desirable, both governments
                        agreed in this paper to continue to lend appropriate assistance to petroleum
                        transit companies in the defense of their interests under existing transit
                        arrangements and to consider negotiating treaties with transited countries
                        designed to lend stability to new pipeline projects.</p>
                    <p>At Bermuda on March 23, the President and the Prime Minister agreed that the
                        United States and the United Kingdom would study separately as a matter of
                        urgency “the present situation and probable future developments throughout
                        the Middle East, dealing first with those aspects of the problems bearing
                        upon the supply of oil to the free world” and exchange views based upon
                        these studies on or before April 15. This agreement is outlined in the
                        undated paper entitled “Agreed Position on Study of Middle East Problems,”
                        approved on March 23.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gordon Gray</persName>, the new Director of
                        the Office of Defense Mobilization in his capacity as Chairman of the
                        President’s Advisory Committee on Energy Supplies and Resources Policy, is
                        calling a meeting of that Committee on April 9 to consider oil imports. The
                        meeting will probably be exploratory, inasmuch as Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> feels that the presence of several new
                        members, including himself, makes necessary one meeting devoted to a
                        familiarization with the issues.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> met last week with several
                        persons who have been intimately associated with this question, including:
                            <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Herbert Hoover, Jr.</persName> who
                        represented the Department of State on the Committee from the date of its
                        formation on July 30, 1954 until his recent departure; Dr. <persName

                            Anderson</persName>, the former Deputy Secretary of Defense; and Mr. J.
                        Ed <persName corresp="#p_SWA1">Warren</persName>, long identified with the
                        domestic crude oil producing industry, formerly a President of the
                        Independent Petroleum Association of America, and now a Senior Vice
                        President of the First National City Bank.</p>
                    <p>Oil imports are a perennial problem for the Department. The problem has now
                        reached a critical stage wherein domestic political pressures, under the
                        guise of a narrow concept of national security, may bring about the
                        imposition of formal governmental oil import restrictions harmful to our
                        broad security interests and in violation of broad foreign policy principles
                        long followed by this country.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Issues</hi></p>
                    <p>Restrictions on crude oil imports are demanded by the domestic crude
                        producing interests, chiefly through such organizations as the Independent
                        Petroleum Association of America and the Texas Independent Producers and
                        Royalty Owners Association. These interests contend that the expansion of
                        the domestic crude oil industry is hindered by oil imports to the extent
                        that national security is <pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0691"
                        />endangered. The <gloss target="#t_IPAA1">IPAA</gloss> uses as its motto
                        the statement, “There is no security in foreign oil for the defense of our
                        own borders”.</p>
                    <p>For several years the United States coal interests, including the mine
                        operators, the miners’ union and the railroads, have demanded severe
                        legislative restrictions on residual fuel oil imports on the ground that
                        such imports have lowered the coal industry’s coal producing capacity to a
                        level which threatens our national security. Although bills have been
                        introduced in the present Congress to restrict residual fuel oil imports, it
                        appears that this problem will not be viewed seriously because of the
                        substantial recovery of the coal industry since its low point in 1954.</p>
                    <p>Restrictions on oil imports have been opposed generally by three groups: the
                        larger oil companies who have holdings abroad and who import much of the oil
                        involved; the oil jobbers (distributors) and the larger fuel oil consumers
                        along the eastern seaboard and in New England; and those manufacturing
                        groups scattered throughout the country who have any considerable export
                        trade dependent upon the dollar income of various foreign economies. These
                        opposition groups are not well organized—in contrast to the domestic oil
                        producers—and in general they are less vocal and less effective in their
                        efforts.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State is the only government agency which has strongly
                        opposed formal oil import restrictions. Over the years the Department has
                        maintained: <list>

                    <p>The import issue is now tied in with the earlier recommendations of the

                        1955—the so-called “national security amendment”.</p>
                    <p>The Advisory Committee issued its basic report on February 26, 1955. It
                        stated that a strong petroleum industry, both in the United States and in
                        friendly countries, and a coal industry operating at a satisfactory level,
                        are essential to our national defense, but that the domestic fuels situation
                        would be impaired if imports of crude and residual fuel oil were to exceed
                        significantly the proportion which they bore to domestic crude oil
                        production in 1954. The report recommended that such a balance be maintained
                        by the voluntary individual action of the importing companies and that every
                        effort be made to avoid governmental intervention. It further recommended
                        that “appropriate action” should be taken in the event imports exceed their
                        1954 proportion, and that the Committee review the desirable proportionate
                        relationships between imports and domestic production from time to time in
                        the light of industrial expansion and changing economic and national defense
                        requirements. (Tab A)<note n="3" xml:id="d247fn3">Tabs A through <gloss

                    <p>Shortly after the issuance of this report, numerous bills were introduced
                        into Congress, including the Neely Amendment to the Trade Agreements
                        Extension Act, which would have restricted crude and residual fuel oil
                        imports by the imposition of fixed legislative quotas. These bills had

                        (Tab B). There exists some implication that <gloss target="#t_ODM1"
                            >ODM</gloss> is obligated to hold oil imports to the level of the
                        Advisory Committee’s recommendations or, failing that, to certify to the
                        President that such imports threaten to impair the national security.</p>
                    <p>The only reference which the President has ever made to the recommendations
                        of the Cabinet Committee and the implementation of voluntary restrictions
                        was contained in his request last fall that <gloss target="#t_ODM1"
                            >ODM</gloss> study the problem of tanker availability; he stated that

                        import policy.</p>
                    <p>During the course of 1955 and 1956, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName>, as Chairman of the Advisory Committee and as
                        Director of <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>, sought by the use of
                        letters addressed to the individual importing companies, and on the basis of
                        reports of importing plans submitted individually by those companies, to
                        keep imports of oil substantially at the 1954 formula levels. After
                        consultation with the Committee, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> modified the formula by permitting, subject to
                        constant surveillance, unrestricted imports of residual fuel oil, crude oil
                        from <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0693"/>Canada and Venezuela, and
                        crude oil imports into the Pacific Coast area (District V). These exclusions
                        in effect limited the application of the formula to crude oil imports into
                        the eastern part of the United States from the Middle East—or only some
                        30–35 per cent of our total crude oil imports.</p>
                    <p>When the mid-1956 reports of the importing companies indicated that their
                        planned imports would appreciably exceed the 1954 rations, the Advisory
                        Committee undertook a broad review of the situation. A report was issued on
                        October 7, 1956, reaffirming the principles and recommendations enunciated
                        in the February 1955 report and confirming the exceptions and exclusions to
                        the formula which had developed in the interim. (Tab C)</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, on August 7, 1956, the Independent Petroleum Association and
                        eighteen other affiliated associations petitioned <gloss target="#t_ODM1"
                            >ODM</gloss> to make a finding under Section 7 that imports were
                        endangering the national security and to so certify to the President.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> on October 22, 1956
                        instituted hearings on this petition and, at the conclusion of the hearings,
                        requested the oil importing companies to review their import plans in the
                        light of the October 7 report of the Advisory Committee and to submit in
                        November revised plans of their imports for the year 1957. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> undertook to judge the resultant
                        import picture by the standards which were set forth in the October 7
                        report.</p>
                    <p>On December 4, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> announced
                        that he was suspending action on the Section 7 hearings, in view of the Suez
                        crisis and the attendant disruption of the oil import trade. He stated at
                        the same time, however, that had it not been for this circumstance he would
                        have had to certify to the President a finding that imports were a threat to
                        the national security.</p>
                    <p>Just prior to his leaving <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>, Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> requested the importing companies
                        to submit plans showing what their crude oil imports will be in the event of
                        resumption of a normal flow of oil from the Middle East. The plans reveal a
                        generally upward trend in crude oil imports which exceeds the rate of growth
                        of our domestic crude oil production. Imports into the eastern part of the
                        United States from the Middle East would total some 5.4 per cent of domestic
                        production in that part of the United States, compared to the suggested
                        formula, or 1954 ration, of 3.8 per cent. Total crude imports into all
                        sections of the United States from all sources would rise to 16.8 per cent
                        of total domestic crude oil production, compared to the permissible imports
                        under the original formula of 10.34 per cent.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Immediate Considerations</hi></p>
                    <p>It is generally conceded in the oil industry that during the course of the
                        past two years the Advisory Committee and <gloss target="#t_ODM1"
                            >ODM</gloss> have “gotten themselves into a box”, with formal
                        restrictions almost a certainty at the next turning. The Advisory Committee
                        faces forthwith the necessity of deciding whether to consider the October 7,
                        1956 report as still valid and its standards still applicable. If so, it is
                        implicit that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> carry forward
                        the course of action initiated by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> and certify to the President under Section 7 that
                        oil imports are threatening to impair our national security.</p>
                    <p>Such a finding would be based on the fact that the 1957 scheduled imports
                        from the Middle East into Districts I–IV of some 310,000 barrels per day
                        exceed by 16 per cent, or about 50,000 barrels per day, the quantity which
                        would be permitted under their 1954 ratio. Yet, in fact, such imports would
                        constitute only a minor part of the total import picture. The industry which
                        would be “threatened” would be the entire United States petroleum
                        industry—producing currently at the rate of 7,800,000 barrels per day, the
                        highest in its history.</p>
                    <p>Alternately, now, the Advisory Committee could, by the issuance of new
                        recommendations and the establishment of other standards, obviate such a
                        portentous course of action. As already noted, the February 1955 report of
                        the Committee recommended that the issue be reviewed from time to time in
                        the light of changing conditions. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> himself also paved the way for such a new review
                        when, during the course of an informal press conference late in December
                        1956, he said that after the Suez crisis the whole picture should be looked
                        at again—and that this should be done <hi rend="italic">from the point of
                            view of the original 1955 concepts</hi>.</p>
                    <p>It is important to bear in mind that, during the course of the past two
                        years, the recommendations of the Advisory Committee and the concepts
                        implicit in the language of Section 7 have become almost inextricably
                        intertwined. At the same time, the refinements and modifications of the
                        import formula have been so substantial that only a third of our total crude
                        oil imports come strictly within its purview; thus the proponents of
                        restrictions can with some justification say that the voluntary restrictions
                        as presently constituted are a mockery. Additionally, during the past two
                        years the Committee had come to look at the oil import situation more and
                        more in the light of a literal interpretation or application of statistics,
                            <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0695"/>and had lost sight of the final
                        observation of the February 1955 report: “… the importance to the economies
                        of friendly countries of their oil exports to the United States as well as
                        the importance to the United States of the accessibility of foreign oil
                        supplies both in peace and war”.<note n="5" xml:id="d247fn5">All ellipses in

                                    widely recognized Chase Manhattan Bank report indicates that
                                    United States crude production will reach its peak about 1965
                                    and decline thereafter, although domestic demand will continue
                                    its rapid increase. The January 15, 1957 <hi rend="italic">World
                                        Petroleum Report</hi>, an authoritative annual review of
                                    international oil operations, states that, “As a result of the
                                    decreasing yields, and other factors, the US has become
                                    increasingly dependent on foreign sources for its oil supply…
                                    There are many indications that this trend will continue at an
                                    accelerated rate in the future”.</p>
                                <p>The rate of increase in the United States demand for oil has far
                                    out-stripped the rate of growth in production. Our once large
                                    exports have dwindled; deficits in supplies have been made up by
                                    constantly increasing imports. In recent years the additions to
                                    proved crude oil reserves have barely kept pace with domestic
                                    crude oil production, and the ratio of total proved reserves to
                                    demand is down to a low level. (Tab D)</p>
                                <p>This situation, however, is the result of a physical
                                    circumstance: most of our readily accessible oil has already
                                    been discovered. The <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0696"
                                    />domestic industry has not slackened in its search for oil; to
                                    the contrary, present incentives are such that the efforts going
                                    into wildcatting and production drilling are constantly
                                    increasing. (Tab E) The higher price for crude oil, which would
                                    accompany any limitation on imports, might inspire a slightly
                                    more liberal exploration program, but it could not insure the
                                    finding of any considerable amounts of additional oil. Thus, the
                                    reduction of the competition from imports would not necessarily
                                    improve our oil reserve position nor the strength of our
                                    domestic crude oil producing industry.</p></item>

                                <p>The United States has strenuously opposed the imposition of
                                    quantitative trade restrictions by many countries; in the
                                    absence of overriding reasons to the contrary, the United States
                                    should not itself resort to such restrictions. The “voluntary”

                                    two years have themselves been of a questionable nature; it is

                                <p>The imposition of oil import quotas would in all likelihood
                                    result in the immediate abrogation by Venezuela of our 1952
                                    trade agreement with that country which forms the basis for a

                                <p>Regional, national and inter-company discriminations would be
                                    concomitant with quantitative restrictions. The recent report of
                                    the Boggs Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee on
                                    Customs, Tariffs and Reciprocal Trade Agreements noted that,
                                    “Even where the effort is made to avoid discriminatory impact of
                                    such restriction on the supplying countries, discrimination
                                    according to the standards of the free-enterprise system cannot
                                    entirely be avoided”. The experience of the Advisory Committee
                                    during the past two years had already led to the conclusion that
                                    certain discriminations would be necessary. Even the more
                                    extreme of the oil import restrictionist group admit, for
                                    instance, that the Canadian industry is almost completely
                                    identified with that of the United States and that imports from
                                    Canada form a natural part of our domestic supply. Other shades
                                    of discrimination are evident: the domestic oil producing
                                    industry has as a foremost objective the elimination of Middle
                                    East imports, rather than the Caribbean where costs of
                                    production are more comparable to those of our own industry.</p>
                                <p>Quotas limiting growth of imports from the Middle East would have
                                    a severe impact there which could tend largely to negate the
                                    effects of the Eisenhower Doctrine. Three of the politically
                                    strategic countries of the Middle East are the source of most of
                                    the oil which comes to the United States from that area: Iran,
                                    Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. The governments of those countries are
                                    eager that the companies producing their oil should continue to
                                    find expanding markets which in turn make possible larger
                                    revenue and tax bases. Those countries are highly cognizant that
                                    their only important commodity in international trade is
                                    oil.</p>
                                <p>It has just come to our attention that the huge world tanker
                                    building program, which is a major defense of the West against
                                    interruption or loss of supplies of Middle East oil, is showing
                                    signs of weakness. A principal cause is the uncertainty in the
                                    industry as to possible United States Government restrictions on
                                    oil imports.</p>
                                <p>In addition to foreign policy considerations, part of the price
                                    which we would pay for restrictions would be the increased cost
                                    of petroleum products to the United States domestic consumer;
                                    price increases in crude oil would be inherent in a limitation
                                    of supplies. The increase of 300 per barrel which accompanied
                                    the Suez crisis <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0698"
                                    />resulted in about $1.5 billion annually to be passed on to the
                                    consumer for gasoline, distillates and fuel oils. The oil
                                    producing interests say that even this was insufficient and that
                                    another 50¢ would be fully justified by the increased costs of
                                    finding oil. The price increase just experienced has already
                                    been the subject of Congressional investigation; certainly the
                                    President in recent months has stressed the greater need for
                                    economy and the necessity of avoiding any new cycle of price
                                    increases and inflation.</p></item>

                                    attitude of the industry: “The best year in history is forecast
                                    for 1957… . Don’t let anybody tell you that the oil industry in

                                    decline. The record for 1956 and the planning for 1957 reveal a
                                    vigorous, aggressive, optimistic industry, an industry that has
                                    good reason to see growth opportunity in every direction”.</p>
                                <p>Importantly responsible for this condition of well-being in the
                                    oil industry are the advantageous tax provisions under which it
                                    operates. The depletion allowance of 27½ per cent is higher than
                                    that granted any other industry. The larger part of all drilling
                                    costs—the intangible costs, such as labor, services and
                                    supplies—may be written off in the calculation of taxable net
                                    income. References to the increasing costs of finding oil are
                                    therefore not fully justified inasmuch as such costs are to a
                                    considerable degree offset by reductions in taxes paid.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> opened the meeting by
                        referring to his extended informal consultation last week (Wednesday, April
                        3) with Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>, <persName

                        The following represented the substance of the advice and conclusions of

                            <item>Answered affirmatively Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2"
                                    >Gray</persName>’s query as to whether, at <hi rend="italic"
                                    >some</hi> level, imports would become a threat to the domestic
                                industry. Agreed that the level of imports indicated for the second
                                half of 1957, 14 per cent (the figure for imports into total U.S.
                                but excluding Canadian or, alternately, for imports into Districts
                                I–IV, with no exclusions), was too high.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Believed that District V as a deficit area should continue to be
                                left outside of any formula. Thus, the Committee should continue to
                                concern itself only with Districts I–IV.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Was at first inclined to recommend the continuance of exceptions
                                for imports from Canada and Venezuela. Concluded, however, that it
                                would be best to have no named exceptions, by region or by country.
                                Instead, an arrangement should be devised which would establish
                                priorities for the several regions within the overall formula; first
                                priority to be given to Canada; second priority to Venezuela and/or
                                the other Western Hemisphere countries; third priority to the Middle
                                East; fourth priority to the Far East.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Suggested that a proportion then be arrived at to be applied to
                                Districts I–IV, applicable to imports from any and all sources. The
                                figure of 11.4%, representing the record for the first quarter of
                                1956, appealed to the group as a reasonable and acceptable figure.
                                (Presumably this was a period when imports had been pretty much in
                                line with the objectives of the Committee; on the other hand it is
                                seen to represent a certain increase over the 1954 ratio of
                                11.26).</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>A new element in the arrangement would have to be some sort of an
                                assigned allowable for each importing company. Such assignments
                                would be made by the Government (<gloss target="#t_ODM1"
                                >ODM</gloss>). The allowables would take into consideration:
                                historic import pattern for each company; and amount of investment
                                overseas; relationship of imports to own domestic production or
                                domestic purchases; whether company was taking advantage of cheap
                                imports only for short-time gain; etc. Additionally, a “kitty” would
                                need to be set aside to allow for the growth factor of new
                                importers.</item>

                            <item><p>This plan, or arrangement, would be <hi rend="italic">in lieu
                                        of a certification to the President under Section 7</hi>.
                                    Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWA1">Warren</persName> questioned how
                                    the promulgation at this time of such a plan could be consistent
                                    with the December 4 statement of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                                        >Flemming</persName>, that scheduled imports for 1957 were
                                    at that time too high and that a certification would have been
                                    made except for the Suez crisis. Finally however, Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_SWA1">Warren</persName> agreed that it was
                                    preferable to do something or anything—if a certification to the
                                    President could thereby be avoided.</p>
                                <p>(Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> himself had an
                                    opportunity within the last day or so to mention this matter to
                                    the President; the President made it clear that <hi

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> went on to mention that on
                        Thursday of last week Mr. <persName>Brownlee</persName> had volunteered to
                        convene the industry task force which had worked in 1954–55 and last fall
                        with the Advisory Committee. The next day Mr. <persName>Brownlee</persName>
                        had to withdraw this offer, because of pressure from his business
                        associates.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> mentioned that Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWA1"
                            >Warren</persName> are currently discussing the oil import question with
                        the independent <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0701"/>and the major oil
                        companies to see what their feelings are at this time. At a meeting with Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> (subsequent to the group
                        meeting last week), Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>’s
                        final suggestions to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> were as

                            <item>The plans of the importing companies for 1957 must be

                            <item>Otherwise (as a threat), the issue would be certified to the
                                President under Section 7 with recommendation that “semi-voluntary”
                                restrictions, as outlined above, be placed in effect by the
                                Government.</item>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> thereupon summed up his
                        understandings of his own present possible courses of action and of the
                        Committee: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>

                                following up the procedures initiated by Dr. <persName

                            <label>2.</label>

                        </list></p>
                    <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> offered the
                        matter to the Committee for discussion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> immediately and
                        emphatically stated that the Government <hi rend="italic">must</hi> continue
                        its efforts to obtain the desirable import relationship through “voluntary”
                        efforts. He said that the alternative—Government control—is so tremendous in
                        its implications that it can only be the very last resort.</p>
                    <p>Judge <persName corresp="#p_HVR1">Hansen</persName> stated that, although he
                        had not participated in the early deliberations of the Committee, he did not
                        at all agree with the basic philosophy of attempting to restrict imports. In
                        his view it is much more desirable to conserve United States reserves and to
                        use imports liberally to satisfy our current demands.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> stated that any arrangement
                        would be attractive which would relieve the Government of the necessity of
                        acting under Section 7. He expressed the view of State that imports are not
                        yet at such a level as to threaten the national security; he agreed with
                            <persName>Judge Hansen</persName> that the conservation, rather than the
                        depletion, of United States reserves might be desirable—if they are in fact
                        not limitless.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> pointed out that it is
                        imperative that the United States industry keep up its incessant search for
                        new discoveries, and that it is thereby imperative that the domestic
                        industry continue to be provided with adequate incentives for
                        exploration.</p>
                    <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0702"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> inquired how the Committee
                        would go about devising a new formula. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> suggested that an earlier procedure be followed and
                        that a task force be set up to develop ideas. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SHA1">Stewart</persName> (Director, Office of Oil and Gas of
                        Interior) suggested that Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWA1">Warren</persName> could block out the broad
                        outlines of a new plan and that his own office could then fill in the
                        statistical details.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> inquired whether the attempt
                        should be made to put the new plan into effect without the company
                        allocations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> strongly
                        recommended such a course of action.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the forecasts for 1957, which indicate substantial excess, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHA1">Stewart</persName> observed that it had
                        always been the case that actual imports were considerably lower than the
                        forecasts had indicated.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> inquired whether an effort
                        should be made to meet the deadline of the <gloss target="#t_IPAA1"
                            >IPAA</gloss> meeting later this month. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> and Mr. <persName>Wormser</persName> said that this
                        was not necessary and that it would be much preferable for the Committee to
                        work along in an unhurried manner.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> referred to the question of
                        his authority or power: could he tell the companies what to do, or could he
                        merely recommend to them? Could he call them in to consult, and ask their
                        advice? Judge <persName corresp="#p_HVR1">Hansen</persName> made it clear
                        that the companies could not come together to devise plans on a joint basis.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> noted that suggestions
                        could be elicited from the companies on an individual basis. He went on to
                        observe that both sectors of the industry, the independent producers and the
                        importers, would accept any moderate, reasonable plan because of their very
                        acute realization that Government controls would be harmful to all
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the one new element in the plan now to be devised—the
                        establishment of regional or country limitations—Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> remarked that he had already received a
                        telegram from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName> in
                        the Middle East pointing out that restrictions which would work against the
                        Middle East countries would prejudice the spirit and the implementation of
                        the Eisenhower Doctrine. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>
                        remarked at this point that such allocations might be advantageous because
                        they would show the countries of the Middle East that the United States is
                        not at all dependent on that area as a source of supply; this would thereby
                        serve to deflate some of the ideas current there as to the strategic
                        importance of their oil.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the possibility that it might be necessary to eliminate
                        the preferential position which Venezuelan oil has occupied in the past, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> whether the Department of State
                        would continue to be in a position to take care of Venezuelan sensitivities;
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> replied in the affirmative
                        and <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0703"/>indicated that he did not
                        believe that this would be an insurmountable problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KDW1">Kendall</persName> (<gloss target="#t_ODM1"
                            >ODM</gloss> Counsel) attempted to summarize the deliberation: The
                        Committee is undertaking to devise a new or modified formula in regard to
                        the desirable import levels to be achieved in Districts I–IV; this will
                        include imports from all sources of supply, but will set up certain
                        limitations to be applied to these various sources. Ideas for such a new
                        plan are to be suggested by the working group which has contributed
                        significantly to the Committee’s efforts in the past: a group composed of
                        Mr. <persName>Gresham</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1"
                            >Beckner</persName> of State and members of the Office of Oil and Gas of
                        Interior. It was hoped that the Committee could meet again next week to
                        consider some tentative plans to be developed by that working group.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>You have asked for comments on the question of a selective tariff on
                        petroleum, as a device to deal with the problems of oil imports as related
                        to national security. Senator <persName corresp="#p_OMJC1"
                            >O’Mahoney</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d249fn2"><persName

                            (D.–Wyoming)</note> has recently suggested that there be a tariff on
                        petroleum high enough to discourage imports of oil from sources where the
                        cost of production is low.</p>
                    <p>Presumably, a selective tariff would be directed primarily against Middle
                        East sources where the cost of production is the lowest in comparison with
                        the United States. Such a selective tariff could be couched in geographical
                        terms, or it could be based on varying rates for oil of differing gravities.
                        This latter would be a more adroit way of discriminating against Middle East
                        oil, which is <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0704"/>mostly high gravity,
                        in an effort to favor Venezuelan oil, an important portion of which is low
                        gravity.</p>
                    <p>The Department has had ample experience with selective tariffs and has
                        studied this particular problem on other occasions in recent years. During
                        the 30’s and 40’s, for instance, we had in effect a tariff quota which
                        permitted a given amount of imports to enter the country at one rate, with a
                        higher rate applied on the excess over this quota. Since the negotiation of
                        a Venezuelan Trade Agreement in 1952, we have had a tariff which
                        differentiates according to the gravity of the oil: higher gravity oils pay
                        10½ cents per barrel, lower gravity oils, 5¼ cents per barrel. These duties
                        are, of course, applied to oil from all sources, by reason of our Most
                        Favored Nation principle. Tariffs at these rates do not have any discernible
                        effect on the flow of oil imports, because in ad valorem terms they are
                        insignificant. A tariff high enough to affect the rate of flow of imports
                        would have to be in the neighborhood of a dollar a barrel.</p>
                    <p>The tariff could be raised by either of two methods. The President could
                        increase it under the authority of Section 7 of the Trade Agreements
                        Extension Act of 1955, although this would probably be challenged in the
                        courts as an invasion of the prerogative of Congress to make tariffs.
                        Alternatively, the Administration could ask for new legislation to raise the
                        tariff. The adoption of such measures, either by the President or by
                        legislation, would probably lead to the abrogation of our trade agreement
                        with Venezuela, our <gloss target="#t_FCN1">FCN</gloss> treaty with
                            Iran,<note n="3" xml:id="d249fn3">Reference is to the Treaty of Amity,
                            Economic Relations and Consular Rights with Iran, signed at Tehran
                            August 15, 1955, and entered into force June 16, 1957; for text, see 20
                            UST 899.</note> and possibly a number of other international
                        commitments.</p>
                    <p>The only countries against which we assess a selectively higher tariff are
                        the countries of the Soviet Bloc, by virtue of denying MFN treatment. The
                        proposal for a tariff on petroleum selectively applied on a geographic basis
                        to the Middle East would single out Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait for
                        more severe treatment than we accord to the USSR and satellites.</p>
                    <p>If selectivity in tariff treatment were achieved by a tariff containing
                        gravity provisions, this would favor Venezuela, but would not get around the
                        problem of Canada, where oils are also of substantially high gravity.</p>
                    <p>No selective tariff could in effect exempt Venezuela and Canada, two of our
                        best markets for exports, from its application. Such a tariff would
                        enormously complicate our relations with these two countries, both
                        economically and politically.</p>

                    <p>We feel that we are well enough informed on the implications of the proposal
                        to suggest that no further study of it is deserved. You are no doubt aware
                        of the fact that we have suggested to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"

                        1955 recommendation that imports should not exceed a fixed percentage of
                        domestic production.</p>

                    <p>Section 7 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1955 requires the Director
                        of the Office of Defense Mobilization to advise the President whenever he
                        has reason to believe that any article is being imported into the United
                        States in such quantities as to threaten to impair the national
                        security.</p>
                    <p>Under authority of this law and under authority of your assigning to a
                        committee of Cabinet members consideration of energy supplies and resources
                        policy, quite extensive investigation has been made of the effect upon
                        national security of crude oil imports into the United States. The
                        investigation clearly established that the rate of imports could reach a
                        point at which the incentive for exploration and development in this country
                        would be so reduced as to make us dependent upon overseas oil supplies to
                        meet our national energy requirement. Further, the investigation gave
                        substantial support to a finding that a significant increase in imports over
                        the level of imports in 1954, unless accompanied by a similar increase in
                        domestic production, would threaten this impairment in our national
                        security. Your committee reaffirmed this finding on October 17, 1956, and my
                        own investigation during the past month supports it.</p>
                    <p>Upon the basis of present imports and their trend over the last several
                        years, together with forecasts of their trend in the next few months. I do
                        hereby advise you, pursuant to Section 7 of the Trade Agreements Extension
                        Act of 1955, that I have reason to believe that <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674"

                                President under Section 7.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Upon calling the meeting to order, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2"
                            >Gray</persName> informed the committee that his certification to the
                        President under Section 7 was already en route to the President. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> had also recommended to the
                        President that: (1) the Presidential consideration of the matter should be
                        undertaken by a panel of three prominent industry consultants, and (2)
                            <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> be directed to pursue with the
                        importing <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0707"/>companies further an
                        effort voluntarily to reduce imports in the direction of the 1954 formula—in
                        order that the President would have the advantage of knowing whether his own
                        actions could be successfully related to voluntary compliance by the
                        companies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> observed that, at the urging
                        of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHA1">Hugh Stewart</persName> of the Office of
                        Oil and Gas, he had in the course of the last few days attempted to get in
                        touch with the management of the ten principal importing companies. He had
                        succeeded in talking with eight of the ten companies. His approach was
                        completely rebuffed in one instance, and in the other instances he had
                        received a sympathetic response but no concrete assurances that imports
                        would be cut back. Appreciating the fact that he has no authority to impose
                        restrictions upon the companies, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2"
                            >Gray</persName> concluded that he had reached the end of the road in
                        attempting to bring about voluntary restrictions by means of telephone calls
                        and the writing of letters. He felt it imperative, therefore, that the
                        matter be referred to the President and that further undertakings be with
                        the more powerful threat of the authority which lies in Section 7.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> did not request the
                        Committee’s comments on this course of action.</p>
                    <p>He did, however, proceed to the matter of how he might attempt the next round
                        of voluntary restrictions—which he anticipated the President would request
                        him to undertake. He observed that there is general agreement that no
                        arbitrary percentage can be fixed, once and for all, as representing the
                        desirable level of imports. He is, therefore, seeking an estimate of the
                        amount of imports which would permit some growth and yet which would have
                        some relationship to the 1954 standard. He wondered whether such a formula
                        should be applied to the entire United States or only to Districts I–IV. He
                        assumed that it is now well established that Canadian imports should not be
                        considered.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> did not receive any fully
                        adequate response to his inquiry. Mr. <persName>Fentress</persName> of
                        Interior said that the Office of Oil and Gas had felt that the importing
                        companies would in fact be going a long way in cooperating if they reduced
                        their indicated excess of imports by 50 per cent. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> made a suggestion, which seemed to
                        be generally concurred in, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2"
                            >Gray</persName> should best approach the independent producing groups
                        to find out how much “give” in the 1954 formula they would cognizance,
                        before he approach the importing companies themselves to seek any reduction
                        in their imports.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> has in mind that all of the
                        import calculations henceforth will be given out to the public; he feels
                        that his greatest hope of enforcement of restrictions lies in this element
                        of publicity. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> took a
                        different position, saying that the only enforcement possible comes from the
                        fear of the entire industry of <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0708"
                        />legislative restraints on imports, i.e., Government interference in the
                        industry.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> pointed out that the White
                        House announcement of the Section 7 certification will come in time to
                        influence the deliberations of the Independent Petroleum Association of
                        America meeting scheduled for this coming week.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                            >Murphy</persName> informed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2"
                            >Gray</persName> privately that the Department of State does not concur
                        in the course of action which is indicated and that the Department wished to
                        reserve its position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName>
                        evidenced surprise that the efforts of the past two years have not had the
                        full concurrence of the Department.</p>

                    <p>Bob <persName corresp="#p_RMR1">Rutherford</persName> has just informed me of
                        the following. He had attended the President’s Advisory Committee on Energy,
                        Supplies and Resources Policy which took place this morning at 10:30.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gordon Gray</persName> announced at that time
                        that he was in the process of certifying to President <persName
                            corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> that petroleum imports had
                        reached a level high enough to jeopardize the national security. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> confirmed to the Secretary at
                        a later meeting that he had already made this certification to the White
                        House.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RMR1">Rutherford</persName> was told this afternoon by
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> that <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> had admitted that the certification to
                        the President was the outgrowth of a political commitment made to the
                        independents last fall. According to <persName corresp="#p_GG2"
                            >Gray</persName>, as reported to <persName corresp="#p_RMR1"
                            >Rutherford</persName> by <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>,
                        the next step will be the White House investigation of the facts. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> has already submitted to the White
                        House a panel of five people, all from industry and not in any way connected
                        with petroleum, from which the President may select his investigators.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName>’s estimate was that the
                        investigation would take several months. He expects during the <pb n="677"
                            xml:id="pg_677" facs="0709"/>interim period to work with the petroleum
                        companies on further voluntary limitations of imports.</p>
                    <p>An announcement regarding <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName>’s
                        certification is to be made tomorrow morning at 10:30. I have, therefore,
                        arranged to let Ambassador Gonzalez<note n="2" xml:id="d252fn2">Cesar
                            Gonzalez, Ambassador of Venezuela.</note> know about this today in order
                        that he may get the information to his government before the announcement.
                        Bob <persName corresp="#p_RMR1">Rutherford</persName> will sit in with me at
                        the meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d252fn3">The source text bears the following
                            handwritten notation by <persName corresp="#p_BMM1">Bernbaum</persName>:
                            “Gonzalez informed and very appreciative.”</note></p>
                    <p>Preliminary reactions to the above gambit are not nearly so discouraging as
                        one might think. As it looks today, the new investigating committee offers
                        the opportunity for a new look at the 1954 formula, which is the basis of
                        our present day troubles, and the possibility of its revision in the light
                        of events indicating that the country could stand a great deal more in the
                        way of imports before affecting the domestic industry. We have what amounts
                        in effect to a holding operation permitting the government to comply with
                        its commitments at the same time that it is setting in motion machinery
                        which could conceivably right the situation. Naturally there is the danger
                        of an ultimate decision confirming Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2"
                            >Gray</persName>’s findings, in which case the President would be
                        required to impose import restrictions.</p>

                    <p>I have your memorandum dated April 23, 1957 advising that you have reason to
                        believe that crude oil is being imported into the United States in such
                        quantities as to threaten to impair the national security.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d253fn2"><ref target="#d250">Document 250</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>The problem of oil imports is one with which I am already generally familiar.
                        As you know, my Advisory Committee on Energy Supplies and Resources Policy
                        has reported to me on the matter from time to time.</p>
                    <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0710"/>
                    <p>On the basis of presently available information I agree that there is reason
                        for the belief that crude oil is being imported in such quantities as to
                        threaten to impair the national security. I shall, therefore, cause an
                        investigation to be made to determine the facts as required by Section 7 of
                        the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1955.</p>
                    <p>While this investigation is going on I request that you carefully examine
                        into the possibility that oil imports might effectively be limited by
                        individual voluntary action of the importing companies. It seems to me that
                        there would be advantages in adjusting imports in that fashion if it is
                        practicable to do so. If the finding and recommendations resulting from the
                        investigation which I shall cause to be made result in my determining that
                        an impairment of the national security is in fact threatened, it will be
                        important for me to know whether an adjustment of the imports can be
                        accomplished voluntarily, or whether other measures may be necessary.<note

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> stated that he sees his task
                        as different from that of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"

                            >Flemming</persName> had attempted to <hi rend="italic">implement import
                            restrictions</hi> on a voluntary basis; Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2"
                            >Gray</persName> is merely going to <hi rend="italic">determine if</hi>
                        restrictions can be effected on a voluntary basis. He believes that this
                        determination can be made in a relatively short period of time—perhaps <pb
                            n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0711"/>several weeks. He will then be in
                        position to advise the President whether, in his opinion, import
                        restrictions—if found necessary by the President—could be worked on a
                        voluntary basis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> intends to protect several

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> is going to meet with Mr.
                            <persName>Wood</persName> and Mr. <persName>Vaughey</persName> of the
                        Independent Petroleum Association of America next Thursday, May 16. At that
                        meeting he will be going to carry forward the line of action suggested
                        during the course of the meeting of the Advisory Committee on April 24,
                        i.e., to find out from the Independents how much “give” there might be in
                        the 1954 ratio, and to do this prior to consultation with the individual
                        importing companies in the direction of seeking commitments for reductions
                        in importing plans. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> concedes
                        that the import issue is a domestic political question.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> understands that Messrs.
                            <persName>Wood</persName> and <persName>Vaughey</persName> have
                        implied—or possibly have stated in so many words—that they would be willing
                        to see the 1954 formula liberalized to the extent of two percentage points.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> hopes that they will confirm
                        such a concession to him. He realizes that he may have misunderstood and
                        that, possibly, Messrs. <persName>Wood</persName> and
                            <persName>Vaughey</persName> were talking in terms of 2/10 of a
                        percentage point. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> recalled
                        that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> had referred to the
                        figure recorded for the first quarter of 1956 for total imports into
                        Districts I to IV from all sources, 11.41 per cent, and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>’s observation that that figure
                        might be taken to supplant the 1954 ratio, 11.26 per cent; these figures
                        differ by about 2/10 of a percentage point.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> observes that the
                        Congressional opinion to which he has been exposed during the past several
                        weeks has emphasized that the <hi rend="italic">trend</hi> in imports is
                        more important than the maintenance of a static ratio. In other words, it is
                        more important that imports do not zoom upward; it would be agreeable if
                        they increased at a moderate proportionate rate.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> also observed that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> has expressed himself
                        as not wishing to be in the position of having been responsible for a
                        general round of price increases—which would almost certainly come about as
                        a result of another increase in crude prices, if imports are in fact held
                        back to the 1954 ratio.</p>
                    <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680" facs="0712"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> asked for the reaction of the
                        group to his proposal. Messrs. <persName>Jordan</persName>,
                            <persName>Miller</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RMR1"
                            >Rutherford</persName> expressed themselves in rather enthusiastic terms
                        to the effect that a liberalization of the 1954 formula at this time by two
                        percentage points would represent a very substantial achievement; firstly,
                        it would represent a breaking of the “sanctity” of the fixed 1954 ratio;
                        secondly, it would represent quantitatively an amount to play with (roughly,
                        an addition of 20 per cent) which might make possible once again to bring
                        actual imports into line with the “desirable” ratio. If the importers can
                        see that they are faced with a growing rather than a fixed ratio, they will
                        be much more eager to hold imports back to the required level.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> inquired whether the group
                        felt that residual should be included; the group replied in the negative.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> inquired whether it would be
                        advantageous to calculate imports against a consumption base, as for
                        instance refinery runs, rather than a production base. The group observed
                        that this had in fact been the recommendation of the industry task force
                        last Fall, and that it would have the distinct advantage of providing a base
                        which would itself be growing proportionately (albeit at a small rate).</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> asked the group to work out
                        for next week some calculations which would take the above ideas into
                        consideration. Additionally, he suggested that an attempt be made to utilize
                        the quantities represented by the additional two percentage points to first
                        take care of the current importers who did not have a substantial 1954
                        record.</p>

                    <p>You will recall it was agreed at Bermuda that the United States and United
                        Kingdom would undertake a review of Middle East problems bearing on the
                        supply of oil to the free world. The <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0713"

                        respect to the main factors involved, which we gave to the British some
                        weeks ago.<note n="2" xml:id="d255fn2">This undated paper, entitled “U.S.
                            Views on Middle East Problems Bearing Upon the Supply of Oil to the Free

                        preparing a separate paper, the British made comments upon our draft. In
                        succeeding discussions we have now agreed on the attached paper. As
                        indicated in the foreword, the paper is intended to provide a common point
                        of departure at the next phase of the discussions, although it is in no
                        sense a formally agreed document. We have given copies of the present draft
                        not only to the offices of the Department which are concerned, but also to
                        other agencies which participated in the preparation of earlier drafts.
                        While we have not received comments from all of them, I believe that the
                        paper will be found acceptable with minor or no modifications.</p>
                    <p>We are thus about ready to undertake the final stage of the exercise, namely
                        higher level discussions between the two governments. In this connection
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE1">John Coulson</persName>, who headed the
                        British delegation in talks with us, has informed me that his Government is
                        anxious that the next talks be held in London as soon as possible. While I
                        gather that their representatives have not yet been designated, I understand
                        that <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Harold Beeley</persName> will probably play
                        a prominent role.</p>
                    <p>I believe that our delegation should include a representative of <gloss
                            target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>, a representative of the Policy Planning
                        Staff, and an oil expert. Perhaps the head of the delegation, when
                        designated, might desire other assistants. I would propose that the makeup
                        of the delegation await your designation of the principal representative. We
                        can then suggest a number of names for his consideration.</p>
                    <p>I have already mentioned to the British the importance we attach to assuring
                        that there will be no publicity regarding the talks. They perceive of no
                        difficulty in this regard, and assured me that they would do everything
                        possible to meet our wishes. If publicity is to be avoided, we will have to
                        treat with particular care the manner in which the group proceeds to London
                        and arrangements for the talks there.</p>

                    <p>That we discuss, at some time convenient to you, the designation of the head

                        <p>In accordance with the “Agreed Position on Study of Middle East Problems”
                            reached at Bermuda, officials of the United States and United Kingdom
                            Governments have separately studied Middle East problems bearing upon
                            the supply of oil to the free world, and have exchanged views based on
                            those studies. The present paper summarizes this exchange of views.</p>
                        <p>While in no sense a formally agreed document, this paper is intended to
                            provide a common United States–United Kingdom point of departure for the
                            next phase, agreed at Bermuda, of deciding “what further procedural
                            steps should be taken to concert the views of the two governments to
                            bring them into accord as far as possible.”</p>

                            <item>In the next 10 years or so it is unlikely that increased supplies
                                of other forms of energy will be sufficient to make much impact on
                                the demand for oil in the free world. Acceptance of this premise
                                does not, of course, obviate the recognized need for the free world,
                                and particularly Western Europe, to pursue vigorously present and
                                projected plans for the development of alternative sources of
                                energy.</item>

                            <item>Free world demand for oil will increase substantially during the
                                next decade, and the bulk of this additional oil will have to come
                                from the Middle East where most of the world’s proved reserves lie.
                                This premise would be dislodged only if very substantial new crude
                                oil deposits were to be found outside the Middle East.</item>

                                capability to deny Western access to oil reserves (Iran 1951–53) and
                                to disrupt Middle East oil transport facilities (Egypt and Syria
                                1956–57). It is essential that more effective measures be devised to
                                protect the free world’s, and particularly the <gloss

                                Middle East oil and to insure against temporary interruptions of its
                                flow. This requirement confronts the West with the difficult
                                problems of maintaining satisfactory political relations with the
                                Middle East countries concerned with the production and transport of
                                oil, and of securing oil supplies against external attack or
                                internal disturbance.</item>

                            <item>The difficulties and dangers inherent in the free world’s
                                dependence on Middle East oil would be intensified if this
                                dependence came to rest upon one or two countries. Two countries,
                                moreover, would not provide what Western Europe currently needs. The
                                United States and United Kingdom should accordingly seek to retain
                                access to the oil resources of all four of the major Middle East
                                producing states: Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. This effort
                                is favored by the heavy dependence of these four countries on
                                revenues derived from the sale of their oil in free world
                                markets.</item>

                                disturbed. Iran has already had a national convulsion over oil; its
                                Government has adopted a pronounced pro-Western stance; it is
                                relatively immune to the fevers of the Arab world.</item>

                                the other Persian Gulf sheikhdoms, and the transit countries—Egypt,

                            <item>In Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, strong internal and external
                                pressures exist on behalf of policies in common with other Arab
                                states. Extreme Arab nationalism that looks to Nasser for leadership
                                seeks to present itself, with some effect, as the exponent of true
                                Arabism. Strong feelings existing in Iraq and Saudi Arabia over the
                                Arab-Israel dispute, and in Saudi Arabia over continuing differences
                                with the United Kingdom, provide bases for pressure and agitation by
                                extremist groups. While these factors do not appear immediately to

                                East oil transport facilities rests principally on two countries
                                (and to a lesser extent on Jordan and Lebanon). Egypt can block the
                                Suez Canal, and Syria alone can breach the existing and operating
                                Iraq Petroleum Company pipelines and Trans-Arabian pipeline. These,
                                moreover, are countries in which Soviet influence is most extensive,
                                Arab nationalism most extreme and involvement in the Arab-Israel
                                dispute currently most immediate. The economic self-interest of both
                                countries in revenues from these facilities, or pressures from
                                petroleum producers and consumers, will serve to inhibit
                                interference with the facilities in normal circumstances, but
                                developments such as a renewed outbreak of Arab-Israel hostilities
                                could well lead to the denial of both Canal and pipelines.</item>

                            <item>Political realities and common prudences dictate that the United
                                States and the United Kingdom should seek to reduce free world
                                dependence on Egypt and Syria. As there is now no practicable
                                alternative to the Suez Canal, the United States and the United
                                Kingdom must also, however, seek to restore normal conditions in the
                                Middle East, so that the Canal, and the existing pipelines, will be
                                available. Security of transit through the countries concerned
                                depends ultimately on their internal political conditions and on
                                United States and United Kingdom political relations with them.
                                Egypt has, of course, an importance which transcends her position as
                                a transit state. Egypt is, and is likely to remain, a center of
                                anti-Western influence and revolutionary tendencies affecting the
                                whole of the Arab world. It is therefore advisable to consider what
                                can best be done to neutralize this influence.</item>

                                are of particular importance. Saudi Arabia has in the past opposed

                                Kingdom in the Persian Gulf area remain unresolved. Saudi Arabia
                                has, however, endorsed the American Doctrine, extended its
                                cooperation with the United States at Dhahran, and has continued its

                                differences of opinion between the United States and the United
                                Kingdom remain (a) the extent to which the Buraimi issue hampers the
                                cooperation of the Saudi Government with the West, and (b) the
                                extent to which a solution satisfactory to Saudi Arabia could
                                endanger the position in the Persian Gulf. Basically, the difference
                                is that the United States Government believes that a formula can be
                                found which resolves the dispute without undermining the Western
                                position in the Gulf, and that Saudi Arabia’s cooperation with the
                                United Kingdom and the long-term Western position in the area would
                                be furthered by a settlement. The United Kingdom Government, while
                                willing to consider any suggestions, is not so far aware of any
                                solution which would satisfy these conditions. At the same time, it
                                believes that, while the existence of the dispute is an inhibiting
                                factor, it need not seriously hamper the evolution of Saudi policy
                                in the desired direction.</item>

                            <item>It is, therefore, all the more urgent that other alternative
                                sources of supply be sought. In the Western Hemisphere, Venezuela
                                could be a significant source if its productive potential were
                                rapidly developed. Colombia also offers opportunities for
                                development. In the Eastern Hemisphere, North Africa is the most
                                promising non-Middle East source and has the special advantages of
                                close proximity to Western Europe and of being a source of
                                non-dollar oil. Burma and Indonesia, too, offer possibilities. These
                                and other promising sources, e.g. Canada, would together provide the
                                means of giving the free world a useful margin of flexibility in
                                future emergencies. It should be stressed, however, that significant
                                development of these potential alternative sources of supply will
                                require several years of concentrated effort. Flexibility would be

                    <p>On May 24, the Cabinet approved a minerals policy and related program,
                        submitted by the Department of the Interior, designed to preserve domestic
                        capacity in metals and minerals production <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690"
                            facs="0722"/>through subsidies and import excise taxes. The decision was
                        taken despite Department of State opposition on the grounds that tariff or
                        quota restrictions would be contrary to the administration’s goal to lower
                        international trade barriers. Documentation on the Department of State’s
                        attitude toward these proposals is in Department of State, Central Files
                        411.004, 411.006, and 811.2543. In a memorandum of May 21 to the Secretary

                        outlined the Department’s attitude on the proposed tariffs on lead and zinc.

                    <p>In February 1957, the Department of the Interior circulated to interested
                        agencies a proposed statement concerning a long-range minerals program for
                        submission of Congress. It was considered on an interdepartmental basis and
                        revised several times. The drafts are in the Eisenhower Library: the April
                        17 draft entitled, “Department of the Interior Proposals for Long-Range
                        Minerals Program,” is in the Records of the Cabinet Secretariat, 1953–1960;
                        the May 22 draft is in the Whitman File; and the final draft, dated June 4,
                        is in the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> Records.</p>
                    <p>The proposals approved in May for implementation by Congress provided for: 1)
                        imposition of excise taxes upon imports of lead and zinc to become effective
                        when prices of these commodities dropped to prescribed levels and suspension
                        when prices rose above specified levels; 2) strengthening and
                        intensification of the Department of the Interior’s activities in research
                        and technical assistance; 3) the establishment of a continuing program to
                        pay bonuses for a limited production of beryl, columbium-tantalum and
                        chromite as research continued to seek ways making these industries
                        competitive; and 4) making permanent the program of financial assistance for
                        exploration conducted by the Defense Minerals Exploration Administration.
                        The excise taxes were to be equal to the duties recommended by the Tariff
                        Commission in 1954, when a tripling of existing duties was suggested, and
                        were to be imposed in two or three stages, depending on the market
                        price.</p>

                            >O’Mahoney</persName>, at 9:00 a.m. this date.</p>
                    <p>Senator Carlson referred to the amendment to the Reciprocal Trade Agreements
                        Act which provides for certain action on the part of the President when
                        imports of any commodity rose to the point where it might endanger our
                        reserves for national defense needs. He pointed out the rapid rise of oil
                        imports and the fact that actually the increase is just starting—that new
                        concessions were being given in Venezuela—and indications were that imports
                        would be increased very materially in the comparatively near future. He
                        referred to 16.6 percent of our overall oil consumption as being the figure
                        which the President’s Cabinet Committee on Energy Supplies and Resources
                        Policy mentioned as being a reasonable level for imports. He expressed the
                        hope that something could be done on a voluntary basis—within the anti-trust
                        laws—to restrict imports at approximately this level.</p>
                    <p>The President referred to the impracticability of working out quotas on the
                        basis of fairness although he stated his willingness to consider every
                        practicable means of arriving at a solution. He advised the group
                        confidentially that very shortly he will appoint a committee outside of
                        Government and outside the oil industry to look into all the facts and make
                        recommendations to him. He referred to previous efforts to handle this
                        matter on a voluntary basis because of the inability of persuading two of
                        the companies, Sun Oil and Tidewater, to participate. He further expressed
                        the thought that in his opinion tariff alone would not do the job.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_OMJC1">O’Mahoney</persName> emphasized what he
                        considered the serious implications of a continued rise in oil imports on
                        our national defense. He went on to state that more and more independent oil
                        producers were finding it difficult to remain in business. He further stated
                        that this matter had a direct impact on the Federal interest as the Federal
                        Government has some 75 million acres of government <pb n="692"
                            xml:id="pg_692" facs="0724"/>lands in oil and gas leases. He brought out

                    <p>He indicated that Wyoming alone gets $9 million a year in this manner. He
                        emphasized the growing impact on this revenue if steps were not taken to
                        insure the survival of the domestic producer. He mentioned the fact that the
                        legislation under which the President might act was broad and gave the
                        President authority for quotas, tariffs, or import taxes, as means of
                        getting at this problem. He further mentioned that the independent operators
                        are at the mercy of the integrated companies for the sale of their oil as
                        they do no processing on their own.</p>
                    <p>The President indicated that he was not only interested in the health of the
                        domestic industry but was also concerned with the effect, on national
                        defense and on the states’ income, of depletion of our reserves, and that he
                        wished to encourage exploration without causing the marketing of too much
                        domestic oil and thereby unduly reducing our domestic reserves—in other
                        words, he felt that a nice balance should be obtained. Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_OMJC1">O’Mahoney</persName> referred to the Federal and
                        State Conservation laws that could be used in this regard.</p>
                    <p>The President again discussed a quota system and emphasized the difficulty of
                        keeping it sufficiently flexible to take care of new discoveries, such as in
                        Brazil, for example. He emphasized the necessity for finding a flexible
                        formula.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_OMJC1">O’Mahoney</persName> felt that the
                        tariff would do this, but the President said that some of his advisers had
                        indicated that the solution was not that simple.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> indicated that
                        information coming to him was that before too long a time we would be
                        swimming in oil from imports and expressed the hope that the matter could be
                        handled on a voluntary basis. He further felt that if a “base period” could
                        be selected which could be agreed upon by the domestic industry, a voluntary
                        quota system might work. He emphasized that this period should not be rolled
                        back too far, as no agreement could then be reached. He further indicated
                        that provisions for newcomers, such as Yemen, Brazil, Libya, should be taken
                        care of in any solution that might be arrived at.</p>
                    <p>The President emphasized that he wants ideas and wants to arrive at a
                        solution that would be as fair as possible to all concerned. He told the
                        Senators that he would be delighted to hear from them <pb n="693"
                            xml:id="pg_693" facs="0725"/>direct or would make arrangements to have
                        them communicate with the committee which he plans to appoint. The Senators
                        advised that they would be very glad to submit to the President a
                        comprehensive memorandum on the subject which could be made available to the
                        committee.</p>
                    <p>The President requested the Senators to keep confidential the fact that he is
                        going to appoint this committee until he has had the opportunity to complete
                        the composition and make the announcement of the appointment of the
                        committee.</p>

                        my agreement with the Director of Defense Mobilization that there is reason
                        to believe the present level of crude oil imports threatens to impair
                        national security. Accordingly, Section 7 of the Trade Agreements Extension
                        Act of 1955 requires me to “cause an immediate investigation” to “determine
                        the facts.”</p>
                    <p>I have determined that such investigation should be made by a special Cabinet
                        Committee consisting of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense,
                        the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of
                        the Interior, and the Secretary of Labor. This committee for convenience
                        will be known as the Special Committee to Investigate Crude Oil Imports. It
                        will make its investigation <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0726"/>and
                        report its findings and recommendations a the earliest practicable date. The
                        Secretary of Commerce will be Chairman.<note n="2" xml:id="d258fn2">The

                    <p>In carrying out this vitally important investigation, the special committee

                        such general factors as our long-term requirements for crude oil, the
                        military, economic and diplomatic considerations involved in obtaining crude
                        oil from various foreign areas, the maintenance of a dynamic domestic
                        industry that will meet national needs in peace or war, and any special
                        significance of imports in different regions of the country.</p>

                                    <p>The dollars earned by foreign producers in selling crude oil
                                        to the United States aid in maintaining high production
                                        levels, employment, prosperity and standards of living in
                                        the free world. Our oil imports thus contribute toward free
                                        world economic and political stability which are essential
                                        to our national security.</p>
                                    <p>The opportunity to import crude oil into the United States
                                        encourages the outflow of United States capital and of
                                        technical and managerial skills for foreign oil development,
                                        thereby contributing to United States’ access to foreign
                                        petroleum resources which are and will be an essential

                                    <p>In the event of war, huge quantities of oil must be made
                                        available to the United States and its allies to support the
                                        Armed Forces and the civilian economies in all areas not
                                        lost to the enemy. Definitive answers to these supply and
                                        logistics problems are a function of the military, but
                                        certain facts are clear. United States domestic oil
                                        production can not be increased sufficiently to supply these
                                        requirements. In some instances, for example, military
                                        operations in the Pacific and Far Eastern areas and the
                                        economies of Australia, New Zealand, and Japan must be
                                        supplied from foreign sources, in this case largely from the
                                        Middle East and Indonesia. Access to the oil resources of
                                        Venezuela, Canada, Indonesia, the Middle East and other
                                        foreign countries must be safeguarded so that they can be
                                        drawn upon to the maximum extent possible. Our oil imports
                                        tend to assure us of access to these supplies.</p></item>

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Although recognizing the importance
                                of safeguarding our capacity to produce oil, the Department does not
                                believe that crude oil imports at the present level are a threat to
                                the national security.</hi></p>
                        <p>The Department recognizes that at some point not easily determinable, oil
                            imports might so depress the income of the domestic crude oil producing
                            industry as to discourage the search for oil and thus impair the
                            national security. At this time most indices show <pb n="696"
                                xml:id="pg_696" facs="0728"/>that the industry is prosperous and
                            expects prosperity to continue. Restrictions on crude oil imports would
                            probably add little to the industry’s effectiveness in finding oil.
                            Therefore, at this time, the Department does not believe that oil
                            imports have increased to a level where the national security is
                            threatened.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. The Department is well aware of the
                                mounting pressure for oil import restrictions. If it becomes clear
                                that such import restrictions must be imposed, certain technical and
                                policy questions should be considered.</hi></p>

                                <p>Although the domestic crude oil industry demands administrative
                                    action under the national security amendment, statements by oil
                                    company officials and in the oil press clearly indicate that the
                                    industry’s primary goal is reduced competition from “cheap
                                    foreign oil” in order to secure higher crude oil prices.
                                    National security is a convenient cloak covering these
                                    aspirations.</p>
                                <p>Since competition, not national security, is the immediate
                                    problem, escape clause procedures under our trade agreements and
                                    the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would seem to be the
                                    appropriate remedy to provide relief against excessive
                                    competition. It is significant that the industry is not seeking
                                    relief through this method.</p></item>

                                    far and has caused few international problems. With the

                                <p>Import quotas are favored by domestic crude oil producers since
                                    they would effectively restrict imports. Quota restrictions
                                    would, however, be highly objectionable from the standpoint of
                                    United States trade commitments and would undoubtedly be
                                    considered by Venezuela as a violation of specific provisions of
                                    the Venezuelan Supplementary Trade Agreement. Attempts would of
                                    course be made to renegotiate those provisions. It is likely,
                                    however, that such attempts would be unsuccessful because of the
                                    importance of oil in our trade with Venezuela. There would be a
                                    strong probability that the trade agreement would be terminated
                                    with possibly serious repercussions for the large United States
                                    investments in Venezuela.</p>
                                <p>Import quotas, unless carefully devised and administered, would
                                    make it very difficult for oil importers since they could not
                                    know whether the oil they had contracted to import or sell or
                                    use would fall within the import quota for a given period. Small
                                    importers would be particularly harmed since their tanker
                                    arrivals are often unevenly spaced. Imports from distant sources
                                    would be at a disadvantage <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698"

                                    quotas would tend to discriminate against imports from distant

                                <p>The imposition of higher duties would also be highly
                                    objectionable from the standpoint of United States trade
                                    commitments, and would undoubtedly be considered by Venezuela as
                                    a violation of the Venezuelan Supplementary Trade Agreement. To
                                    be effective in restricting imports such import taxes would have
                                    to be substantial. In effect they would favor low cost sources,
                                    such as the Middle East, which could absorb the taxes, and
                                    discourage higher cost sources, such as Venezuela.</p>
                                <p>It should be noted that import restrictions enforced by quotas or
                                    higher import taxes would result in higher prices of petroleum
                                    products in the United States. They would detrimentally affect

                                        the historic import pattern, reasonable allowance for new
                                        importers, and the proportion of foreign crude in each
                                        importer’s refinery operations. The administrator would have
                                        to keep in mind both fairness and practicability in making

                                    whether or not import restrictions should be imposed, the
                                    committee should periodically review the level of crude oil
                                    imports and the operation of any imports control system that

                                    may be required by the public interest. If some form of import

                                    deemed necessary, it is believed that the use of a control
                                    system, such as the one described above, and a periodic review
                                    of the situation by the committee should enable the Government

                                    area east of the Rockies is becoming a crude oil deficit area
                                    requiring ever larger proportions of crude oil imports to
                                    domestic demand. It should also become clear that a continued
                                    rise in imports is compatible with prosperity in the crude oil
                                    producing industry.</p></item>

                    <p>B returned the call and the <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss> said re oil
                        business—he is worried about some aspects of it because he has the feeling
                        this business about the national security is a good deal of window dressing.
                        B agrees. What they are doing, said the <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>,
                        is to try to put the price of oil up and put more of the Texas wells into
                        production and accelerate new drilling which will only happen if the price
                        goes up. They are beginning to run dry and it takes more drilling to get the
                        same amount of oil as before and so the cost is higher. B said the Sec’s rep
                        on the Comm does not faithfully reflect his views.<note n="2"

                        imports into individual companies we thought it would be a violation of
                        anti-trust laws and subject to triple damage suits. The <gloss
                            target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss> mentioned quotas to the companies. B made
                        it clear to the contrary. <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> and

                        thing that imports should not rise above the 1954 levels we think—the <gloss
                            target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss> interrupted and gave a formula—something
                        about the area east of the Rockies should not exceed 11% of the total. B
                        said if they get together it is a violation of the law. B mentioned its
                        involving a statement by the Pres—these are the factors and we think it is
                        in the best interests of the country. But they can’t get into sanctions and
                        they can’t get together. The <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss> said only
                        in theory each makes a contribution to the whole but can’t sit down. B
                        agreed and said it was the situation for the last two years. B said if it
                        would help to have them attend the meeting they would be glad to do it. B
                        asked they not be on the Comm but rather act as counsel and be called in as

                                1965; this increase would represent to the area additional income of
                                approximately $160 million annually.</item>

                            <item>The restrictions would apply particularly to imports from Saudi
                                Arabia, Iran, Iraq and Kuwait. These countries are not likely to
                                view US action as consistent with our profession of friendship and
                                desire to assist them with their economic development. It might be
                                construed as an effort to exert political pressure, especially by
                                Saudi Arabia.</item>

                            <item>Since the contemplated restrictions are apt to discriminate
                                against Middle East petroleum, they will, once understood by
                                countries of the area, be considered most objectionable; and they
                                are likely to lend encouragement to additional discriminatory
                                economic policies on the part of the Arab League.</item>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> reminded the Council that

                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/8) was approved six weeks ago, action
                        on paragraph 48 (Stockpiling) was deferred to allow the various departments
                        and agencies better to develop their views. The stockpiling policy approved
                        in 1956 (paragraph 47 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602/1)<note

                        allowed stockpile planning to be done on the basis of a five-year war, but
                        provided for procurement on a priority basis only for objectives based on
                        three years.</p>
                    <p>In the proposed new paragraph 48 which was now before the Council, the
                        majority Planning Board recommendation would restrict <hi rend="italic"
                            >all</hi> stockpile procurement to the three-year basis; <hi
                            rend="italic">except</hi> in those limited cases where procurement,
                        within the long-term objectives described in the President’s April 1954
                        directive, is necessary to maintain the vital domestic production component
                        of the materials mobilization base. The Director of <gloss target="#t_ODM1"
                            >ODM</gloss>, continued Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                        >Cutler</persName>, had noted at the bottom of the page that in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 procurement under this policy could
                        include lead, zinc, and battery-grade manganese.</p>
                    <p>The Defense, Treasury and Budget members of the Planning Board proposed
                        deleting the exception clause and noting that through <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1959 there may be limited procurement of antimony, lead,
                        zinc, and battery-grade manganese. These members feel that the majority
                        language might be interpreted as approval, from a national security
                        viewpoint, of the long-term objectives.</p>
                    <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0736"/>
                    <p>The President commented that he supposed that these members wished to
                        continue this minerals component of a vital mobilization base, but they
                        wished to do so by means of tariffs to protect domestic production of these
                        minerals rather than to achieve the protection through stockpile procurement
                        of these minerals.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> observed that actually at the
                        present time there were only three such items to be procured—namely, lead,
                        zinc, and battery-grade manganese. He went on to point out that if the
                        Council adopted paragraph 48 without the exception clause, as advocated by
                        Defense, Treasury and Budget, such a proposal would appear to override the
                        President’s directive of April 1954. He therefore hoped that the exception
                        clause could remain in the new paragraph. In any event, he could assure the
                        Council that we would be out of the business of procuring lead and zinc for
                        the stockpile in a year or two.</p>
                    <p>The President first suggested the addition of the three specified materials
                        to the exception clause. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName>, however, said he would stop the whole procurement of
                        materials for the stockpiles. He had absolutely no confidence in the
                        validity of the stockpile requirements, which he believed were based on
                        concepts of fighting a war along the lines of World War II. He realized that
                        this was rather an extreme position, but he advocated that we quit
                        stockpiling as something that was past in this country.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that he was not so sure that stockpiling was a thing of
                        the past, in view of what we had been hearing in the discussion of Plan
                            <gloss target="#t_D1">D</gloss>-Minus. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, however, warned the President that
                        if we continued to stockpile, the President would have these materials
                        hanging around his neck just as he now had agricultural surpluses.
                        Stockpiling of these minerals was merely a means of supporting domestic
                        production that we do not need in this country.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that either we have to continue to stockpile these
                        minerals or else we should have to protect domestic production by raising
                        the tariffs on them. Moreover, he was very much afraid of losing friends
                        like Mexico. This consideration was quite apart from the political realities
                        which we were facing in the mining states.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied that he
                        certainly had no objection to recognizing the political aspects which
                        required stockpiling. But it was important not to disguise these political
                        considerations as requirements of national security. The President again
                        stated his opposition to a resort to raising tariffs around the world. If we
                        did so, we were bound to lose our friends.</p>
                    <p>Asked for his views, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWR1">Burgess</persName>
                        said that he found himself in agreement with Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>. While he did not oppose the
                        purchase of these minerals for the stockpile, he did not <pb n="705"
                            xml:id="pg_705" facs="0737"/>wish to have such purchases made in the
                        name of the national security. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2"
                            >Gray</persName> noted that battery-grade manganese, at least, did have
                        national security implications.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion of this matter, the President stated that he would
                        accept paragraph 48 as formulated by the majority, together with the
                        footnotes.</p>

                                        mobilization base procurement could include lead, zinc, and

                                        directive of April 14, 1954, the long-term objective for
                                        zinc would be reached in almost a year and the long-term
                                        objective for lead would be reached in almost two years. New
                                        purchases of zinc and lead for the Strategic Stockpile will

                    <p>The meeting opened with a brief discussion on procedure. At the suggestion of

                        proceeded at once to consider the alternate recommendations to be made by
                        the committee. It was pointed out by Chairman <persName corresp="#p_WS1"
                            >Weeks</persName> that the alternative methods of limiting imports were: <list>

                            <item>by imposing company quotas either on a voluntary or mandatory

                            <item>by imposing a limited level of imports and allowing the companies
                                to fight it out as to which obtained its share thereof by analogy to
                                action that had previously been taken in the agricultural
                                field.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> pointed out that there
                        were serious difficulties with a tariff control because of the low price of
                        Middle East oil. The tariff would have to be very high in order to
                        discourage the importation of oil from that area. A country quota created
                        grave foreign policy difficulties. On the whole, the company quota method,
                        initially voluntarily and mandatory if necessary, seemed to be the best
                        approach although he wanted an examination of the possibility of imposing
                        only a level of imports.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSR1">Rogers</persName> spoke briefly on the
                        legality of the first three methods of regulation. He felt that the company
                        quota system would be satisfactory on a mandatory basis if it were not
                        unreasonably discriminatory as respects any company, but he did feel that it
                        would be necessary to give each of the importers a day in court. There was
                        some discussion as to whether and to what extent this requirement would
                        delay the imposition of mandatory controls. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSR1"
                            >Rogers</persName> ultimately expressed the view that the delay would
                        not have to be too long since some of the companies might waive a hearing
                        and the facts to be ascertained were not extremely complicated.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> expressed the view
                        that it would be unnecessary at this time to make a final determination of
                        what had to be done in order to impose mandatory controls. He felt that we
                        could try the voluntary controls and thought that the companies wanted to
                        avoid the trouble involved in mandatory controls, so that the voluntary
                        system would work for a couple of years, so long as there was not
                        unreasonable discrimination in the system of voluntary controls. He pointed
                        out that although there were some differences, a voluntary system of
                        controls had been in effect prior to Suez and that it had broken down only
                        as a result of Suez. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> was strongly of the view that the decision should
                        be made as to voluntary controls without detailed examination of mandatory
                        controls, the latter to be considered if and when a voluntary system broke
                        down.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MJP1">Mitchell</persName> raised several
                        questions with particular reference to the relationship of this program and
                        national security. He asked whether or not the decrease in exploratory
                        drilling that had occurred during the last six months was due to local
                        factors rather than to increased imports. He questioned whether some of the
                        decrease in exploration was due to the fact that smaller companies could not
                        afford exploratory drilling at present day costs. Even the larger companies
                        were pressed by such costs. He also raised a question as to the approach of
                        the paper in pointing out a decrease <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0740"
                        />in exploratory drilling during the last six months, while during the past
                        ten years there had been an upward trend in exploratory drilling.</p>
                    <p>During the course of this discussion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> expressed the view that the national security
                        determination was based on expectation of what would happen with respect to
                        exploratory drilling. He was assured that such drilling domestically would
                        decrease in the foreseeable future and this did pose a threat to our
                        national security. It was perhaps true that some of this decrease was
                        inevitable and that ultimately we would have to allow more imports, but that
                        was a question that could be faced in reviewing the program.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MJP1">Mitchell</persName> also pointed out
                        that the price of oil was above the index for prices generally. He suggested
                        further that if we were to take this action with respect to oil imports,
                        there would be a demand that similar type of action be taken in the mineral
                        fields and with respect to fish. It was the sense of the meeting that these
                        other industries were distinguishable.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then reviewed the
                        various methods in the light of foreign policy considerations. He pointed
                        out that one basic factor here was the fact that Middle East oil was cheaper
                        and this had a direct impact upon the domestic market and exploratory
                        drilling. Because of the cheapness of Middle East oil, control by tariff
                        would involve far too much of an increase in the tariff. With respect to the
                        proposal that a quota be imposed on countries, the Secretary pointed out the
                        gravity of any such measure in particular relation to our relations with
                        Canada and Venezuela, as well as the Middle East. He regarded that method of
                        regulation as wholly unsuitable in the light of foreign policy
                        considerations. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> also
                        felt that similar foreign policy considerations would not permit us to
                        merely set a level of imports and allow the companies to fight it out as to
                        how this was to be divided up. Such a system might also work out inequitably
                        as among companies, but he felt also that this would merely mean a flood of
                        Middle East oil.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> thought that the most
                        feasible method of regulation at this time was a voluntary limitation on the
                        basis of company quotas which, in his view, should be clearly qualified to
                        take care of hardship cases. There was then a brief discussion as to whether
                        or not the proposal with respect to Tidewater was unduly harsh on that
                        company, in view of the fact that they had built a large new refinery. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> expressed the view that
                        this might be taken care of by phasing additional imports for Tidewater over
                        a period of time. He did not feel that Tidewater should be permitted to jump
                        from some 22 to 84 in one step. He envisaged increasing Tidewater to 60 or
                        perhaps 80 over this period of time.</p>
                    <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0741"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> pointed out that the plan
                        as announced would not include the tables identifying the quotas of the
                        respective companies. He suggested that if there were to be any exceptions
                        or qualifications on the ground of hardship, as, for example, in the case of
                        Tidewater, it would be better to put them into the plan at this time. After
                        some discussion, however, it was felt more desirable to put the plan into
                        operation and then to permit adjustment for hardship cases if such
                        existed.</p>
                    <p>At this point in the meeting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName> circulated to some of the participants and read a
                        revised proposal respecting the treatment of Areas I–IV and Area V. The
                        substance of this change was that there would be some cutback in the Area V
                        program for the last half of 1957 although, as Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> pointed out, this cutback would not
                        be serious because in that area importers would be permitted to fill the gap
                        between domestic supply and demand. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> expressed some concern at this because of the
                        delicacy of our relationship with the new Canadian government and indicated
                        that he would take this aspect of the plan under advisement.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> raised a question as
                        to whether or not there was adequate connection between the proposed
                        limitation program and the national security. He was primarily concerned
                        with the fact that while the plan was being put into effect in order to
                        induce additional domestic exploration, there was no requirement to that
                        effect in the plan as drafted, nor were the quotas related to additional
                        exploration. In this connection it was pointed out that the national
                        security portion of the draft had been rewritten to bring out more clearly
                        the relationship between the limitation program and the national security.
                        It was also pointed out that in consideration of various types of limitation
                        thought had been given to relating quotas to exploratory drilling, but this
                        proved impracticable because some of the companies having large exploratory
                        programs were not importers.</p>
                    <p>After some further discussion, it was moved by Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> and seconded by Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> that the program of voluntary
                        limitation of oil imports be approved in principle, subject to revision of
                        the wording and also subject to revision in detail, and this motion was
                        carried unanimously. Thereupon, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> left the meeting.</p>
                    <p>It was further agreed that the draft plan would be revised over the weekend
                        and another meeting would be had on Monday, July 22.</p>
                    <p>A question was raised as to whether the plan would be discussed in advance
                        with the companies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSR1">Rogers</persName>
                        pointed out that the President could not give antitrust immunity under this
                        plan and that discussions between companies on it would be subject to very
                            <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0742"/>grave question. He felt that
                        the only contact there should be was that between government and individual
                        companies, and opposed the idea of having such contact in advance. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> pointed out that this
                        would occur in due course in the light of the provision for hardship cases,
                        and it would perhaps be preferable to put the plan into effect and then have
                        individual companies approach the government. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MSR1">Rogers</persName> agreed with this approach.</p>
                    <p>A further question was raised as to whether the plan would be accompanied by
                        an opinion of the Attorney General. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSR1"
                            >Rogers</persName> was unwilling to do this on the antitrust aspects,
                        but did agree to have prepared a memorandum which could be released in
                        conjunction with the plan, pointing out the scope of the President’s power
                        under Section 7. It was the sense of the meeting that this would be helpful
                        because it would indicate to the companies that the possibility of mandatory
                        limitation was a very real one.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> pointed out that the
                        Secretary of State desired that after the plan had been finalized there be a
                        reasonable period, on the order of 48 hours, in order to permit the State
                        Department to discuss this matter in advance with governments such as Canada
                        and Venezuela. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> agreed
                        with this proposal but suggested that he be reminded of it at the next
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>Following the meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> made
                        some minor drafting suggestions to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon
                            Anderson</persName>.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> opened the meeting by
                        reading a letter from Acting Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_MSR1"
                            >Rogers</persName> regarding the legal position with respect to the
                        establishment of a system of voluntary controls.<note n="2" xml:id="d264fn2"
                            >Not printed.</note> The letter did not deal with mandatory controls,
                        except in the sense of suggesting that there be a hearing before the
                        adoption of mandatory controls with a formal system of appeals for use
                        thereafter. (Copies of the letter should be available to members of the
                        Committee but were not so available at the time of the meeting.)</p>
                    <p>Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> raised a
                        question of the interpretation of Section 7 of the Trade Agreements
                        Extension Act of 1955. He pointed out that the language of the Act calls for
                        a finding that items are now being imported in such quantities as to
                        threaten the national security, and he noted that the Committee’s
                        recommendations were along the line of considering limitations necessary
                        because planned shipments, to be made in the future, are expected to
                        threaten national security. There was considerable discussion of this point
                        and Secretary-designate <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName>
                        explained the importance of dealing with oil on the basis of plans of at
                        least 3 months and preferably of 6 months. Unless arrangements are reviewed
                        6 months ahead of time, it becomes impossible to control an immediate
                        situation because tanker charters have been fixed and purchases and sale
                        contracts made. The Committee agreed to use the language “current (as well
                        as proposed)” to describe the situation.</p>
                    <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0744"/>
                    <p>Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> raised a
                        question as to the wisdom of the 10% figure for reduction in imports by
                        established companies. He wondered what basis had been used to determine
                        that 10% was the right figure. The response was that no figure was endowed
                        with magic significance and that this seemed a reasonable one in terms of
                        the situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> noted that
                        it was rather arbitrary.</p>
                    <p>There was a long discussion of the proposed paragraph mentioning residual
                        fuel oil and distillates. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName>
                        and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AWPJ1">Armstrong</persName> had proposed the
                        omission of these items as not within the terms of reference of the
                        Committee. This was recognized as valid, but the point was made by Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> that crude oil quotas
                        could be evaded by the importation of distillates, which according to the
                        Customs Court are considered for customs purposes as crude oil, although
                        their essential value is about double that of crude oil as it comes from the
                        well, on a barrel for barrel basis. Everyone agreed that the limitation plan
                        should not be frustrated by imports of distillates of this kind or for that
                        matter by residual fuel oil. Some language was eventually agreed which noted
                        the possibility that “petroleum products” might be imported as a means of
                        escaping from the provisions of the crude oil limitation plan and suggested
                        that the Director of <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> keep an eye on
                        imports of such products, including distillates and residual fuel oil.</p>
                    <p>There was considerable discussion of the difference in treatment afforded to
                        District V as against Districts I through IV. Mr.
                            <persName>Morgan</persName> raised the question as to whether
                        discrimination could be effected on a mandatory basis. He implied that if
                        this were not the case perhaps the wisdom of proceeding with the voluntary
                        procedure should be reconsidered in view of existing doubts as to whether it
                        would work. Acting Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_MSR1"
                            >Rogers</persName> said that from a legal standpoint mandatory controls
                        would have to be non-discriminatory. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SFA1"
                            >Seaton</persName> suggested that perhaps the system would not work,
                        perhaps mandatory controls could not be enforced, and perhaps the President
                        should be informed nothing could be done about it. This discussion was
                        relatively inconclusive and also tended to move into the question of whether
                        in fact imports had any effect on exploration. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_SFA1">Seaton</persName> said the views available to the
                        Interior Department would not appear to substantiate the conclusion that
                        imports were impeding exploration.</p>
                    <p>Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said that the
                        security question had been examined by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and that
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> had defined the oil
                        resources of Venezuela and Canada as related to United States national
                        security. This led to a general discussion of possible exemption for Canada
                        and Venezuela and of alternative means for limiting imports. Deputy
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> suggested that this
                        might be done by raising the tariff considerably, <pb n="713"
                            xml:id="pg_713" facs="0745"/>without taking action to limit quantities
                        by quota, either voluntary or mandatory. This evoked some comment on the
                        foreign relations impact of tariffs and of the relationship of the question
                        to provisions of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and the Venezuelan
                        trade agreement, in which the views of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, as stated at earlier meetings, were
                        reemphasized.</p>
                    <p>The result of this discussion was that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> agreed to look at the formula again to see whether
                        a single formula on a company by company basis could be arrived at under a
                        voluntary system. It was also understood that Acting Attorney General
                            <persName corresp="#p_MSR1">Rogers</persName> would examine the legal
                        problems which might stand in the way of the establishment of mandatory
                        controls. At the same time it was recognized that the Committee had approved
                        in principle, at its earlier meeting, the establishment of a voluntary
                        company by company system with no effective controls on imports into
                        District V.</p>
                    <p>There was a brief discussion of the domestic political atmosphere and of the
                        possibility of legislation which would be more restrictive than the
                        voluntary plan being considered. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1"
                            >Weeks</persName> indicated he did not think that there was much chance
                        of legislation at this session if action was not taken to limit imports, but
                        that there would be a real problem when the Trade Agreements Act came up for
                        renewal next year.</p>
                    <p>In the course of these discussions the Committee proceeded, somewhat slowly,
                        with redrafting the report. It was agreed that the Committee would reconvene
                        at 4:00 p.m. on July 23 to continue the redrafting with the idea of having a
                        report prepared by July 24 if possible.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary told Ambassador Gonzalez that he sought this opportunity to
                        discuss the action pending by the United States <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714"

                                >Rubottom</persName> stated that González was calling at the
                            Secretary’s request and noted: “This is in accordance with our practice
                            of consulting informally with the countries most concerned with our oil
                            import policy. These exchanges of views not only serve to keep those
                            countries informed of current developments but also provide them with a
                            sense of participation in the formulation and implementation of the
                            policies we adopt.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note> Since the Suez
                        Canal crisis they had increased sharply, to the point of constituting a
                        menace to oil development in the United States and hence our own national
                        security. The Secretary referred to the action of President <persName
                            corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in establishing a Cabinet
                        Committee chaired by Secretary of Commerce <persName corresp="#p_WS1"
                            >Weeks</persName> and on which he sat along with the Secretaries of
                        Interior, Treasury and Labor and the Attorney General. He said that he had
                        participated actively in the Committee meetings and that, while the
                        Committee’s work had not yet been completed, he thought it was now timely to
                        consult with the Ambassador in order that he might report directly to his
                        country. We recognize the importance of petroleum in our relations with
                        Venezuela.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that it appeared that the Cabinet Committee’s
                        recommendations to the President would be along lines so as to permit the
                        following conclusions to be drawn: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>Restrictions to be applied would be on a voluntary basis, at least
                                in the beginning, and would be applied to companies rather than to
                                countries.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>Companies would be expected to fall back approximately to the
                                level of their 1956 imports into the United States and would have to
                                restrict their imports for the second half of 1957 which were
                                “extravagant”.</item>

                            <item>The formula to be applied for the percentage of imports would be
                                somewhat in excess of that which had been applied by the Cabinet
                                Committee in February, 1955 (i.e., the 1954 ratio).</item>

                            <item>There would be no discrimination with respect to countries or
                                geographical areas of the world, although the fact that no
                                restrictions were contemplated for District 5 would tend to give
                                somewhat more favorable treatment to the countries shipping oil to
                                that area.</item>

                            <item>U.S. import restrictions now would be advantageous to exporting
                                countries in helping to maintain a satisfactory price for their oil
                                since the prices paid them are based on U.S. Gulfport prices.</item>
                            <label>(6)</label>
                            <item>The plan contemplated would permit foreign oil-producing countries
                                to share in the growth of the U.S. market.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Ambassador González expressed his appreciation and that of his government for
                        the opportunity to discuss this subject with the Secretary. He acknowledged
                        that oil was absolutely vital to his country. He was certain that
                        Venezuela’s interests were not being overlooked by the Secretary and the
                        Department of State. They recognized the heavy pressure against imports led
                        by the independent <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0747"/>oil producers of
                        the United States. The Secretary interjected to remind the Ambassador of
                        what he had pointed out to the Venezuelan Government at the time of his
                        visit to Caracas in 1954, namely that U.S. exporters to Venezuela, who have
                        at least as much at stake in maintaining a market here for Venezuelan oil as
                        does Venezuela herself, are politically unorganized, thus making it all the
                        more difficult for the Department to portray the importance of our two-way
                        trade with Venezuela.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that he would communicate immediately with his
                        Government. The Secretary cautioned the Ambassador to make clear that the
                        program is wholly tentative and subject to final approval by the Cabinet
                        Committee and then the President. The Secretary, in answer to the
                        Ambassador’s query, estimated that it would be at least three or four more
                        days before any announcement would be made, perhaps more.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The entire meeting was devoted to drafting and redrafting the proposed report
                        of the committee, beginning with the conclusions and recommendations.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SFA1">Seaton</persName> suggested
                        elimination of <pb n="716" xml:id="pg_716" facs="0748"/>reference to the
                        “current level of imports”, as being a threat to national security. He said
                        that nobody from the Oil and Gas Division of the Department of the Interior
                        would testify that the current level would impair the national security,
                        although they all had a hunch that the proposed level might. There was
                        considerable debate on this point, which resulted in the conclusion that the
                        committee would not make a finding that the national security was impaired
                        by the current level of imports within the meaning of Section 7 of the Trade
                        Agreements Extension Act of 1955. It was felt preferable to make a finding
                        that the present and proposed level threatened the national security to the
                        point where a limitation on imports was required, but that there should be
                        no formal finding, because of the implication of the need for mandatory
                        action if such a finding were made. A primary factor in the conclusion not
                        to invoke Section 7 was the point made by the Acting Attorney General that a
                        finding might imply a preparedness to proceed with mandatory action. He
                        noted that no plan for mandatory action had been developed, and that the
                        proposed voluntary plan might not be in accordance with the Constitution if
                        it were tried on a mandatory basis, because of the discrimination between
                        East and West Coasts.</p>
                    <p>There was a substantive discussion with respect to the figures for imports
                        into District V. The report contained the figure 290,000 barrels a day, but
                        the Oil and Gas Division had informed Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SFA1"
                            >Seaton</persName> that their figure for the difference between
                        consumption and production in the district was 250,000 barrels a day. It was
                        necessary to refer in the discussion to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName>’s memorandum to the Secretary of State regarding a
                        new estimate for District V which included the figure of 274,000 barrels a
                        day, plus 13,000 barrels allowance for addition to stocks. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> agreed to straighten this out with
                        Interior.</p>
                    <p>There was also a substantive discussion of the question of procedure for
                        entrance of newer importers into the market. It was decided to have the
                        report refer to the idea of having older importers “move over”, so that the
                        Secretary of the Interior could have this as a point to rely upon in dealing
                        with companies.</p>
                    <p>There was no time for discussion of the national security section of the
                        report, and members were asked to telephone their comments to Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName>’ office before 10:00 a.m. on
                        the following day.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said that, if no difficulties with the national security section
                        developed, there would be no need for a further meeting. The report would be
                        presented to the President within a day or so. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AWPJ1"
                            >Armstrong</persName> made it clear that they would have to review with
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> the new version of
                        the conclusions and recommendations, and that the Department expected a
                        period of at least 48 hours after the President had approved <pb n="717"
                            xml:id="pg_717" facs="0749"/>the report before publication, so that

                        Governor <persName>Adams</persName>’ call of June 28, confirmed by your
                        letter of the next day,<note n="2" xml:id="d267fn2">Not printed.</note> that
                        you felt I might be of service to you in a consulting capacity on the
                        problem of crude oil imports.</p>
                    <p>As you know, I have given rather intensive study to the subject these past
                        few weeks, and have participated in several meetings with the Cabinet
                        Committee you named to consider the problem.</p>
                    <p>It seems to be appropriate to present at this time and in this manner some
                        views which I hold. They are not in any sense inconsistent with the
                        Committee’s report; rather they supplement one part of it. They relate to
                        the aspects of the subject on which you named me as consultant, viz., the
                        impact of crude oil imports on the national security. And I have a
                        procedural recommendation which if adopted would seem to give a better
                        dimension of time to our policy, while in no wise interfering with the
                        committee procedure now under way.</p>
                    <p>I am convinced that the security of the Nation is closely related to the
                        availability of oil, and that the complex problem of maintaining an
                        appropriate balance between imports and domestic production is one which
                        will be with us in more or less acute form for a long time. In view of these
                        circumstances, it has occurred to me that you might want to see certain long
                        term national objectives in this field spelled out and formalized perhaps in
                        the National Security Council, with the Departments of Commerce and Interior
                        participating, in addition to the regularly constituted Council
                        membership.</p>
                    <p>Let me recount here a few basic facts.</p>
                    <p>Oil is the source of well over half the energy generated and used in the
                        United States. It has had, along with other energy <pb n="718"
                            xml:id="pg_718" facs="0750"/>sources, its highly material bearing on the
                        development of our agricultural, commercial and industrial strength—all in
                        tandem with national security needs. Yet the mobile and flexible qualities
                        of oil have made it much more than merely another source of energy. It is so
                        peculiarly suited for delivery, and for energizing weapons—land, sea, and
                        air—used in modern warfare, that it has come to be a weapon itself.</p>
                    <p>Since oil became a significant source of energy less than fifty years ago, we
                        have had ample supplies from indigenous sources.</p>
                    <p>We have also had enough oil for substantial and profitable exports—both crude
                        and petroleum products.</p>
                    <p>In two major wars in this century we have had sufficient indigenous
                        production that neither our own cause nor that of our Allies suffered from
                        lack of available oil production.</p>
                    <p>We had enough excess capacity during the Korean war, when domestic production
                        increased by over 1,000,000 barrels per day.</p>
                    <p>During the Suez crisis we had enough; albeit with some limits well in sight.
                        Our export-import position was flexible enough to absorb in a short period a
                        net change of nearly a million barrels per day; we increased exports by
                        700,000 barrels while imports were cut 200,000.</p>
                    <p>It is significant that, during not one of the four critical periods named,
                        did we produce all the oil involved. With each crisis, of the four named,
                        increasing proportions of the oil supply came from elsewhere—the Middle
                        East, Venezuela, Canada, etc. The salient fact seems to be that in each
                        instance we were in a position to produce and we did produce the <hi
                            rend="italic">difference which counted</hi>. We had, in a healthy
                        domestic industry, the excess capacity which <hi rend="italic">made the
                            difference</hi>.</p>
                    <p>It seems clear that we should never let ourselves get into a position where
                        we would find this critical difference unavailable to us in time of
                        emergency. No nation can do for us what we did for the European nations
                        three times in this century.</p>
                    <p>From the foregoing considerations, I believe we can derive two basic general
                        assumptions upon which <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> consideration
                        might proceed.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>First, the United States must have an assured source of energy
                            (including oil in the measurable future) for continued sound economic
                            growth and development as well as the strengthening of our military
                            capabilities. Without such assured sources we can be checkmated in time
                            of peace or denied victory in war.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, an assured supply of energy—including oil—to our Western
                            Allies is essential to the survival of the Free World as we know it. I
                            believe this latter requirement approaches parity with the first in our
                            strategic concepts.</item>
                    </list>
                    <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0751"/>
                    <p>Where is this oil and what are the salient facts about it? The sources may be
                        roughly classified.</p>
                    <p>There is Western Hemisphere oil (U.S., Canada, Caribbean, other South
                        America) where supplies are likely to be available to us under emergency
                        conditions. Though the quantities are not unlimited, vigorous exploratory
                        activities, for the most part by U.S. companies, have continued to build up
                        reserves and productive capacity.</p>
                    <p>There is Eastern Hemisphere oil (chiefly Middle East) where for all practical
                        purposes, productive capacity and reserves are unlimited. (It is doubtful
                        that limits as to quantity there will be encountered in this century.)</p>
                    <p>There are other sources and other methods whereby, at least in theory,
                        additional oil supplies could be made available. Vast amounts of crude oil
                        apparently exist in Rocky Mountain shale, but they are far from competitive
                        with oil (or other available energy sources for that matter) and could be
                        developed only at staggering public expense. This course would presumably be
                        rejected. Another alternative which I believe likewise would be rejected is
                        that of accumulating from domestic or foreign production and at public
                        expense, a static hoard of crude oil in overhead storage or in depleted
                        fields. I believe that these and other possible avenues, such as the
                        refining of coal into oil, will continue to prove to be impractical and
                        unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>Such methods are seemingly ruled out by the vigorous oil-finding and
                        oil-producing free enterprise mechanism operating throughout the Free
                        World—an international oil industry in which American concerns are
                        predominant. It is apparently clear that much oil remains to be found and
                        the vitality of the industry has been demonstrated in its ability to find
                        and produce oil at a rate sufficient to meet security needs, without
                        requiring large government expenditures.</p>
                    <p>The determination of the extent to which governmental intervention may be
                        necessary to preserve the vigor of that portion of the industry essential to
                        national security involves the resolution of policy issues and the balancing
                        of political, military, and economic considerations—within the overall
                        framework of basic national security policy. The long term implications of
                        the problem of oil imports are, I believe, disclosed by the following brief
                        analysis:</p>
                    <p>The economics of the world oil situation are such that for the time being and
                        for the foreseeable future, foreign oil will, unless restricted, flow into
                        the United States in increasing quantities. Oil can be produced in the
                        Middle East (and elsewhere) and laid down in U.S. ports at figures below the
                        cost of finding, producing and transporting it in the United States. This
                        flow of cheap foreign oil at an appropriate level can serve to supplement
                        the domestic supply, <pb n="720" xml:id="pg_720" facs="0752"/>facilitate
                        domestic conservation practices, and enhance our friendly relations with
                        foreign producing countries. On the other hand, such an unrestricted flow
                        can become a glut to choke the domestic industry and kill the initiative to
                        explore for more expensive oil in the United States. Additionally, it seems
                        fairly certain that a glut of cheap oil from the Middle East would remain
                        cheap and remain a glut only so long as we do not become dependent upon
                        it.</p>
                    <p>What then, in general terms, should our objectives be?</p>
                    <p>We should welcome, it would appear, the importation of oil from the Middle
                        East and other foreign sources, not to displace, but rather to supplement
                        our own domestic supply, and facilitate the use of sound conservation
                        techniques in this country.</p>
                    <p>At the same time our object should be to ensure that our economic and
                        military strength do not become so dependent on the continued flow of Middle
                        East oil that in time of crisis we would face the unacceptable alternatives
                        of (a) resort to force to hold the source, or (b) suffer the crippling
                        effect of its loss.</p>
                    <p>We should seek, in the concurrent pursuit of the two foregoing objectives, to
                        achieve a balance, reflected in a permitted level of imports which will
                        preserve the climate of incentives under which a healthy and vigorous
                        domestic industry can continue to develop.</p>
                    <p>We should foster and encourage in all other ways the development of greater
                        productive capacity and reserves throughout the Western Hemisphere, with
                        first emphasis on the development of indigenous reserves and productive
                        capacities.</p>
                    <p>I have discussed the matter of possible <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >N.S.C.</gloss> cognizance of this subject with Secretary <persName

                        this vital subject and I hope the foregoing ideas and suggestions will be

                        forthcoming report of the Cabinet Committee. He noted the Committee’s
                        tentative conclusion that the anticipated level of imports for the balance
                        of 1957 would threaten national security. He believed the Committee would
                        recommend a voluntary plan for limiting imports which would still provide
                        opportunity for new companies to enter the field. While the Cabinet
                        Committee was not about to recommend specific controls, he felt that should
                        the voluntary system fail the Cabinet Committee would have to undertake to
                        develop mandatory controls.</p>
                    <p>The President asked if the Committee had decided that a tariff would be
                        useless as a means of controlling imports. <gloss target="#t_Sec1"

                        since it would keep out Canadian and Venezuelan oil but let in Arabian oil—a
                        development that would make the United States dependent on Mid-East oil.

                        <p>The problem of oil imports, and their effect upon the domestic petroleum
                            industry, was one of the primary reasons that caused President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> to establish the Cabinet
                            Committee on Energy Supplies and Resources Policy in July, 1954. The
                            President directed the Committee to study and evaluate all factors
                            pertaining to the continued development of energy supplies and resources
                            in the United States, “with the aim of strengthening the national
                            defense, providing orderly industrial growth, and assuring supplies for
                            our expanding national economy and for any future emergency.”</p>
                        <p>On February 26, 1955, the White House released a report on energy
                            supplies and resources policy in which the Cabinet Committee concluded
                            that in the interest of national security imports of crude and residual
                            oils should be kept in balance with the domestic production of crude oil
                            at the proportionate relationships that existed in 1954. The Committee
                            also recommended that these ratios should be re-evaluated from time to
                            time in the light of changing circumstances.</p>
                        <p>As a result of this study the importing companies were requested to
                            restrict imports of petroleum to the United States on a voluntary,
                            individual basis in conformity with the policies enunciated by the
                            Committee. The voluntary method was chosen as a matter of basic policy
                            in preference to tariffs, quotas, or other methods of mandatory
                            limitation in order to avoid regulatory controls wherever possible.</p>
                        <p>As a result of considerable debate in Congress upon the subject of
                            petroleum imports, the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1955 included
                            the following Section (7): <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“(b) In order to further the policy and purpose of this section,
                                    whenever the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization has
                                    reason to believe that any article is being imported into the
                                    United States in such quantities as to threaten to impair the
                                    national security, he shall so advise the President, and if the
                                    President agrees that there is reason for such belief, the
                                    President shall cause an immediate investigation to be made to
                                    determine the facts. If, on the basis of such investigation, and
                                    the report to him of the findings and recommendations made in
                                    connection therewith, the President finds that the article is
                                    being imported into the United States in such quantities as to
                                    threaten to impair the national security, he shall take such
                                    action as he deems necessary to adjust the imports of such
                                    article to a level that will not threaten to impair the national
                                    security.”</p>

                        <p>The policy of voluntary restriction worked with reasonable success until
                            the middle of 1956. At that time the schedules submitted to <gloss

                            half of 1956 and the first half of 1957 indicated that there would be a
                            sharp rise in imports, and that the volume would be substantially in
                            excess of the proportional relationship that had been recommended by the
                            Committee.</p>
                        <p>As a consequence of the increased level of imports scheduled for the last
                            half of 1956, the Independent Petroleum Association of America (<gloss
                                target="#t_IPAA1">IPAA</gloss>) filed a petition on August 7,
                            requesting action under Section 7 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act
                            of 1955.</p>
                        <p>After the petition had been filed, the Director of Defense Mobilization
                            announced that a public hearing would be held at which all interested
                            parties would be provided with the opportunity of presenting their
                            points of view. This hearing began on October 22, 1956, and was
                            conducted by the General Counsel of <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>.
                            Representatives of persons and groups favoring and opposing action under
                            Section 7 were heard. In addition, at the request of <gloss
                                target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>, representatives of oil importing
                            companies made statements relative to their plans for the future. The
                            hearing was concluded on October 24, 1956. Information developed in the
                            hearing has been considered by this Committee.</p>
                        <p>Early in December, 1956, the Director of Defense Mobilization announced
                            that he was suspending action on the case because of the changed
                            conditions growing out of the Suez crisis. At the same time he made this
                            statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Import programs of the importing companies recently filed with

                                    had formulated for 1957, if carried out, would be contrary to
                                    the Committee’s recommendations and would constitute a threat to
                                    our national security. This situation, without other intervening
                                    circumstances (the Suez crisis), would have left no course for
                                    me but to make a certification to the President under Section 7
                                    of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1955.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In a letter dated March 6, 1957, the Director requested the importing
                            companies to furnish <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> with more
                            recent estimates of their import plans for the balance of 1957, assuming
                            that normal oil movements could be resumed in the near future.</p>
                        <p>The estimates for imports during the last half of 1957 were compiled and
                            presented a situation of even greater seriousness than that which
                            prevailed prior to the Suez crisis, for the new schedules were
                            considerably higher than those that were submitted for the fall of
                            1956.</p>
                        <p>On April 23, 1957, the new director, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2"

                        <p>Review of the oil import levels year by year does not indicate that
                            through the first half of 1956 crude oil imports had reached such a high
                            level as to constitute a threat to the national security. Imports
                            scheduled for the last half of 1956 and for the first half of 1957 were
                            of such a magnitude that in the judgment of the then Director of the
                            Office of Defense Mobilization they would have constituted a threat to
                            national security. However, the interruption of petroleum transportation
                            from the Middle East to the area west of the Suez which occurred in
                            November 1956 disrupted the normal pattern of petroleum movements over a
                            period of several months, and, as a result, the schedule of imports for
                            the last half of 1956, as well as the one for the first half of 1957,
                            was never put into effect.</p>
                        <p>The program of imports for the last half of 1957 as presented to the
                            Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization during March and April
                            indicated that the importers planned to increase materially the import
                            levels over those of 1956 (See Table I).<note n="4" xml:id="d270fn4">Not

                        <p>Your Committee’s investigation of the oil import problem has been
                            confined to the effect of the present trend of imports on national
                            security.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that there is a direct relationship between the nation’s
                            security and adequate and available sources of energy. Oil and gas
                            account for two-thirds of all the energy that is consumed in this
                            country. Furthermore, there is no adequate substitute in sight for the
                            foreseeable future. Therefore, we must have available adequate supplies
                            of oil.</p>
                        <p>We have concluded, for reasons that are set forth later in this section
                            of the report, that if we are to have enough oil to meet our national
                            security needs, there must be a limitation on imports that will insure a
                            proper balance between imports and domestic production.</p>
                        <p>Before arriving at this conclusion, we considered and rejected, for the

                            policy of unrestricted imports, your committee has concluded that if we
                            are to have a vigorous program of exploration in this country by private
                            enterprise in order to care for increasing domestic consumption and to
                            meet emergency needs, and if we are to know what our reserve potential
                            is in this country, it is essential <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727"
                                facs="0759"/>that we follow a policy which will encourage
                            continuation of free enterprise exploration at a rate consistent with
                            the demands of a growing economy.</p>
                        <p>The latest available figures demonstrate that the amount of oil we are
                            adding to our reserves is not keeping pace with the increase in domestic
                            consumption, in spite of the fact that our reserves are at an all-time
                            high. Indeed, there has been some recent indication of a decrease in
                            exploratory drilling, notwithstanding an increase in domestic demand for
                            petroleum. There has also been a decrease in the number of exploratory
                            crews in operation. It is not possible to attribute this decline to any
                            single cause. The sharp increase in imports programmed by the importers
                            in their report to <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> indicates such a
                            trend of increase in relation to domestic production as will bring about
                            a further decline in domestic exploratory and development activities.
                            This should not be permitted. The time lag between exploration and
                            production requires that we explore today for tomorrow’s useable
                            reserves. Any other course will impair industrial expansion,
                            availability of supplies for consumer use, and preparedness for an
                            emergency.</p>

                        <p>Your committee recognizes that there are important foreign policy aspects
                            to the problem of limiting petroleum imports. The oil reserves and
                            production capacities of other free nations, as well as our own, are
                            important to our national security. A number of countries inevitably
                            depend in varying degree upon access to our domestic market for their
                            petroleum exports and it must be recognized that it is also in the
                            interest of our national security that our allies and friends have
                            healthy and expanding economies. It is believed, however, that taking
                            all factors into consideration, our national security requires the
                            maintenance of some reasonable balance between imports and domestic
                            production at this time. In light of the foregoing considerations, our
                            recommendations are framed with the objective of limiting imports in
                            order to maintain such a balance and yet to allow other nations to
                            participate in the growth <pb n="728" xml:id="pg_728" facs="0760"/>of
                            our domestic demand to a degree consistent with our national
                            security.</p>
                        <p>It is our conviction that as a Nation we must pursue a careful,
                            considered course that will permit reasonable imports into our country
                            and still stimulate a dynamic and vigorous exploratory and development
                            effort in this country.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">IV. Effect on Consumers.</hi></p>
                        <p>Domestic consumers are utilizing an increasing amount of petroleum
                            products for transportation, fuel, heating and many other aspects of
                            consumer life. In the event of a national emergency, it is essential to
                            these consumers that there be adequate supplies at reasonable cost, both
                            now and in the future. The low cost of imported oil is attractive, but
                            excessive reliance upon it in the short run may put the nation in a
                            long-term vulnerable position. Imported supplies could be cut off in an
                            emergency and might well be diminished by events beyond our control.
                            This vulnerability could easily result in a much higher cost, or even in
                            the unavailability, of oil to consumers. It is therefore believed that
                            the best interests of domestic consumers, as well as of national
                            security, will be served if a reasonable balance is maintained between
                            domestic and foreign supplies.</p>

                                            level of imports must be such as to make up the
                                            difference between the demand and the quantity of
                                            domestic crude oil available to the area, as established
                                            by the Department of the Interior. The schedule of
                                            imports for the last half of 1957, as submitted by the
                                            companies to the Director of Defense Mobilization
                                            appears to be slightly higher than would be called for
                                            by the foregoing formula. However, there is reason to
                                            believe that the imports for this period will not exceed
                                            275,000 barrels per day and, consequently, no voluntary
                                            import limitations are proposed for this District at the
                                            present time. This situation should be reviewed,
                                            however, during the latter part of 1957 from the point

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> referred to the Symington
                        hearings on stockpiling.<note n="2" xml:id="d271fn2">Senator
                                <persName>Stuart Symington</persName> was a member of the Armed
                            Services Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on National
                            Stockpile and Naval Petroleum Reserves.</note> He said that the
                        Administration, in its testimony, would not attempt to avoid disclosing the
                        three-year basis now in force for stockpiling. He expected that the hearings
                        would pursue the question as to why and how the former five-year policy had
                        been altered after having been set by the President and Cabinet Committee in
                        1954. The President agreed that it would be in order for Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> to point out that appropriate further
                        consideration had been given to the matter, that the change had been fully
                        coordinated and approved by the President.</p>
                    <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0764"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> then raised the problem
                        connected with the rights of several aluminum companies as set forth in
                        contracts signed in 1951 to offer quantities of aluminum to the Government
                        at market prices. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> made clear
                        that this provision had been put into contracts at a time when the
                        Government felt it necessary to encourage expansion of aluminum production
                        and the companies needed some assurances for the future. As a sort of quid
                        pro quo, the Government had the right to call on the companies to supply it
                        with necessary quantities of aluminum.</p>
                    <p>In response to the President’s question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2"
                            >Gray</persName> stated that these rights would expire mostly in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 but that in some instances they might
                        continue until December 1958.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> stated that he had to appear
                        before a Joint Committee on July 30th to discuss this matter and how the
                        Government would handle the situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2"
                            >Gray</persName> indicated that the current budget would not permit
                        Government purchase of these offerings for the stockpile at this time,
                        particularly in view of the change from a five-year base to a three-year
                        base with the three-year level already attained.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> noted a belief by some
                        officials that the Government should reject these offerings and let the
                        aluminum companies go to court to seek fulfillment of the contract provision
                        if they so desired. His own feeling was that the Government should continue
                        to discuss this matter with the companies, seeking some mutually
                        satisfactory adjustment of the contract.</p>
                    <p>The President felt that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gray</persName> should
                        make a straightforward presentation to the Committee, stressing the changed
                        situation between 1951 and 1957, and particularly the changed basis for
                        estimating our probable requirements in the event of war. The President
                        could not see at the moment how the aluminum could be bought if it were not
                        budgeted, yet he did not want the Government to lay itself open to a charge
                        of bad faith by an out-of-hand rejection. He believed discussions with the
                        companies should continue.</p>

                        Your exposition of the national security effects of unrestricted crude oil
                        imports strikes me as excellent.<note n="2" xml:id="d272fn2">Reference is to
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName>’s letter of July 24,
                                <ref target="#d267">Document 267</ref>.</note> In the main I agree;
                        I think I disagree only with one point which I find in the first paragraph
                        on page six: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“At the same time our object should be to ensure that our economic
                                and military strength do not become so dependent on the continued
                                flow of Middle East oil that in time of crisis we would face the
                                unacceptable alternatives of (a) resort to force to hold the source,
                                or (b) suffer the crippling effect of its loss.”</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>I think that you have, in the analysis presented in the letter, proved that
                        should a crisis arise threatening to cut the Western world off from Mid-East
                        oil, we would have to use force. You specifically point out that an adequate
                        supply of oil to Western Europe ranks almost equal in priority with an
                        adequate supply for ourselves. You argue that while the Western Hemisphere
                        can on an emergency basis meet the short term requirements of the entire
                        free world, the implication is included that we cannot do this on the long
                        term. Hence my disagreement with the statement to which I call your
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>By this I mean that you prove the facts of the petroleum world are such that
                        the West must, for self-preservation, retain access to Mid-East oil.</p>
                    <p>In general, however, I merely express the hope that our long term national
                        objectives in this field can be spelled out and formalized so that they will
                        mean something—in other words, that they will encourage maximum exploration
                        in our country and use of imports as a supplemental, not a ruinous
                        substitute, for our own production.</p>
                    <p>I was pleased that you were able to devote some of your time to the work of
                        the Cabinet Committee. I know that you were a great help.</p>
                    <p>With warm regard,</p>

                    <head>273. Editorial Note</head>
                    <p>In Washington, August 5–9, representatives of the United States and the
                        United Kingdom continued their discussions of the problems of transporting
                        Middle East oil. While in Paris on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        matters in July, <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Earl Beckner</persName> had
                        informal discussions with officials from the British Ministry of Power about
                        an agenda for talks which would lead to a general study on vulnerability of
                        the West to closure of the Middle East oil transit facilities. (Letter from
                            <persName corresp="#p_AWC1">Willis C. Armstrong</persName> to <persName

                        and a summary of the discussions are attached to a memorandum from <persName

                    <p>As a result of these talks, the representatives produced a joint paper which
                        dealt with the supply and demand situation as estimated for 1960 and 1965,
                        the transport problem in providing oil to Western Europe, and the role of
                        Middle Eastern oil. (Letter from <persName corresp="#p_BER1"
                            >Beckner</persName> to Goodman, August 24; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi>
                        880.2553/8–2457) It was decided that each government might discuss the paper
                        with oil industry persons cleared to receive classified material.
                        (Memorandum of conversation by Simmons, August 9; <hi rend="italic"
                            >ibid.,</hi> 880.2553/8–957) They agreed to meet again in September to
                        discuss the next joint paper which would consider the following points:
                        government encouragement of the development of sources of supply outside the
                        Middle East, stockpiling, extra pipeline capacity, fleet reserve, pipelines,
                        inducements to reroute, and emergency machinery such as was instituted
                        during the Suez emergency—the Middle East Emergency Committee and the <gloss

                                <p>“If the President were to consider favorably Mr. <persName

                                    of oil imports compatible with a proper defense posture, but
                                    that an attempt should be made to work out a new long-range
                                    petroleum policy, which would take into consideration current
                                    military guidance as to the type and duration of any war which
                                    would be fought and would reassess the resources and
                                    transportability of crude oil and petroleum products, and well
                                    as requirements, in the light of estimated attack damage.”<note

                        comments about my recent work on the subject of oil and national security.
                        Your letter of July 30<note n="2" xml:id="d275fn2"><ref target="#d272"
                                >Document 272</ref>.</note> would have had an earlier response
                        except that I have been away from my office most of the time since I saw you
                        in Washington late last month.</p>
                    <p>The point of our apparent disagreement to which you advert appears to me to
                        expose the heart of the issue to be resolved in long term policy
                        formulation, viz. the <hi rend="italic">nature and the degree</hi> of
                        dependence on Middle East oil which we as a nation can afford.</p>
                    <p>I am afraid I failed to express adequately the particular concept which you
                        question, but I believe in it so strongly that I should like to lay it
                        before you again and attempt to show how it is reconcilable with the
                        proposition that in case of a real showdown we would have to use force to
                        retain access to Middle East oil.</p>
                    <p>I ask in the beginning that it be borne in mind that “access” in such context
                        may vary in meaning, depending on related circumstances, all the way from
                        the full and virtually unrestricted access <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737"
                            facs="0769"/>which we enjoy now to an even more severely restricted
                        access than that which we had last fall for a relatively short period. The
                        latter one triggered action by two of our Allies; I assume that a most
                        material subject of our inquiry would be the degree of denial of access
                        which would trigger similar action by us. This I respectfully submit will
                        depend upon the circumstances existing at the time the issue arises, and my
                        point is that in the meantime and before the issue is presented in U.S.
                        affairs, we can have a great deal to do with the shape and form of those
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p>In my humble view, history discloses that any nation, whatever its form of
                        government, may have to initiate the use of force when it becomes checkmated
                        in the areas of diplomacy, economics and military preparedness. The decision
                        which actually induced such war may have been made long before in policy
                        formulation, with the result that when such policies produced or permitted
                        the circumstances going to make up the checkmate, no real choice would be
                        left and but one decision could be made.</p>
                    <p>We are considering, in advance, I believe the critical question that will
                        arise down the line after surrounding circumstances have crystalized—the one
                        which we would hope to answer in terms of continued peaceable methods. It is
                        whether at a given stage our dependence and that of our Allies on this oil
                        is so great that events at such stage present a threat to our own vital
                        security interests. The question then will contain many elements and many
                        related circumstances, the right analysis of each of which will have to go
                        into the answer. Such elements are: <list>

                            <label>(d)</label>
                            <item>The likelihood that oil from other sources on a temporary or even
                                a prolonged basis would be sufficient to “sweat out” the nation or
                                nations which threaten to cut off the supply, or interrupt
                                transportation.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>When that time of decision comes, the more we have done and encouraged our
                        nationals to do, in the way of developing alternative sources of oil and in
                        keeping all outside sources more dependent on us than we are on them, the
                        better will be the opportunity to ride it out and avoid either (a) resort to
                        force to retain access to the source, or (b) suffer the crippling effect of
                        its loss.</p>
                    <p>There are various ways, by tax incentives and otherwise, in which our
                        Government can encourage the already active search by American companies for
                        oil in other parts of the world.</p>
                    <pb n="738" xml:id="pg_738" facs="0770"/>
                    <p>There are likewise various ways in which we can ensure that such producing
                        areas are dependent on our (and our Allies’) taking their oil. By our tax
                        and tariff policies we can encourage the building of refining and processing
                        plants <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> the area of production and in the
                        consuming countries. (A handful of Russian technicians could have operated
                        the Iranian producing areas and the big refinery at Abadan; on the other
                        hand Arabia with limited refining capacity at hand is greatly dependent for
                        continued production upon consuming nations in the free world.)</p>
                    <p>I firmly believe that we can count on the flow of Middle East oil for a long
                        time if we do not allow the degree of dependence (and that of our Allies) on
                        that single source to become too great. Then we can probably ride out all
                        crises short of Russian intervention; and as to Russia’s intervention in the
                        picture, we have a sound and settled doctrine.</p>
                    <p>I would strike my word “unacceptable” from the paragraph you questioned and
                        cause it to read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“At the same time our object should be to ensure that our economic

                                    <del rend="strikethrough">unacceptable</del> alternatives of (a)
                                resort to force to hold the source, or (b) suffer the crippling

                    <p>The meeting opened with the report of Captain Carson concerning the operation
                        of the import restriction program. Captain Carson presented the main points
                        of the report orally, and distributed copies to the various agencies.
                        (Copies of the report are attached to this memorandum.)</p>
                    <p>Imports during the second half of 1957 will be somewhat higher than the
                        target, but this is natural in view of the fact that the program was not
                        announced until July 29, and that procurement schedules cannot be quickly
                        changed. The decline in import levels has begun, however. Certain problems
                        have emerged. One of them, the fact that there are six or eight small
                        importers who were not listed at all at the time the report was prepared.
                        Another problem arises from the fact that several of the companies listed
                        object to their quotas and have obtained the right to formal hearings to
                        protest the quotas assigned to them. A third problem consists of the fact
                        that such companies as Superior, Ashland, and Crown, have all announced
                        their intention to become importers at the rate of about 25,000 barrels a
                        day each, beginning quite soon. If the total quota may be increased, perhaps
                        these problems can be resolved, but otherwise it will be very difficult. It
                        will be awkward to persuade other importers to reduce their amounts so as to
                        make room for “new” importers”. If adjustments are made to allow for all
                        “new” importers a very substantial increase in imports over the recommended
                        level will occur.</p>
                    <pb n="740" xml:id="pg_740" facs="0772"/>
                    <p>Assistant Secretary Mueller presented the case of Socony Mobil which has
                        cooperated fully with the program, but which has requested that certain
                        crude oil from Venezuela, which is of a very high asphalt content, and which
                        Socony imports for processing at an asphalt plant in East Providence, Rhode
                        Island, be exempted from the crude oil quota. Captain Carson had ruled that
                        it could not be exempted, because of the definitions used by the Committee.
                        Assistant Secretary Mueller had felt that this was inequitable. There was a
                        long discussion of this matter. It was recognized that imports of high
                        asphalt crudes were logical for road-building materials and for the chemical
                        industry. It was also recognized that in many cases there was no domestic
                        crude available instead, but that the alternative was to import residual
                        fuel oil. Consequently, it was quite clear that no benefit to the domestic
                        crude oil industry would accrue from restriction on a certain portion of the
                        high asphalt crudes. It was recognized that some 120,000 barrels per day of
                        such asphaltic crudes are normally imported. It was finally agreed that a
                        letter would be written to Socony Mobile by Mr. <persName>Mueller</persName>
                        which would indicate that no exception would be made in the definition of
                        crude oil, but it would leave the door open to some form of adjustment, in
                        view of the fact that Socony has fully cooperated, and in view of the merits
                        of the case.</p>
                    <p>There was a general discussion of how to handle “new” importers, and it was
                        recognized that increases in demand could not really be counted upon to
                        satisfy the requirements of the new importers, and that there would,
                        therefore, have to be cutbacks in scheduled imports, by both the new
                        importers and the more established ones.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> brought up the
                        question of Defense Department purchases of jet fuels. The Defense Petroleum
                        Agency has gone out for bids for 35 million barrels of jet fuels, and has
                        received bids from American companies for delivery from a variety of
                        sources. From the standpoint of cost, the arrangement which is most
                        satisfactory is to obtain 8 million barrels off shore. Of this amount
                        800,000 will be used off shore, and another 800,000 will be delivered on the
                        West Coast. The Defense Department will save around $3 million by this
                        procurement process as against what would happen if it procured all the jet
                        fuel domestically. The law requires it to buy competitively at the lowest
                        price, and there is an exemption of petroleum from the provisions of the Buy
                        American Act. The question was the extent to which it was appropriate for
                        the Defense Department to procure from abroad about a quarter of its
                        requirements for jet fuels, in view of the fact that the government is
                        engaged in trying to limit imports of oil. A general discussion followed,
                        and it was agreed that the Defense Department had no alternative but to
                        proceed with its procurement. It would, however, <pb n="741" xml:id="pg_741"
                            facs="0773"/>issue a public statement explaining its action in terms of
                        saving money and the requirements of competitive bidding. It was also agreed
                        that the announcement would not be of such a nature as to involve any
                        question of possible change in the Buy American Act so as to make it apply
                        to petroleum.</p>

                                as Administrator of the Voluntary Oil Import Program. The Program is
                                that recommended by the President’s Special Committee to Investigate
                                Crude Oil Imports on July 29, 1957, and approved by the President on
                                that same date.</item>

                                import, on a thousand barrel per day average, during the year ending
                                June 30, 1958. Responses were received from all the companies
                                addressed, and only one company, Sun Oil Company, stated that it
                                could not participate in the program; however, its reply indicated
                                that it would reduce its imports to the figure recommended by the
                                Committee for that company by April 1, 1958. Other replies varied
                                from statements of unreserved cooperation with the Government in the
                                program to noncommittal statements regarding adherence but
                                requesting a hearing on the quantities recommended.</item>

                            <item>It was to be expected that imports of crude oil into Districts I
                                through IV during the last half of 1957 would exceed the quantities
                                recommended by the Committee. The Committee’s recommendations were,
                                of course, directed to a daily average during the year ending June
                                30, 1958. Several factors are responsible for an overage during the
                                last half of 1957. First of all, the Committee’s recommendations
                                were not made public until July 29, 1957, and were, therefore,
                                retroactive in application to July 1. Adjustment in tanker schedules
                                could not be made overnight, and the relatively heavy imports during
                                the month of August can in large measure be attributed to tankers
                                loading for or already enroute to the United States when the <pb
                                    n="743" xml:id="pg_743" facs="0775"/>program was announced.
                                Furthermore, some time must elapse to adjust commitments for the
                                purchase of crude oil overseas.</item>

                            <item>Despite these factors, crude oil imports into Districts I through
                                IV have shown a decline since the inception of the program from a
                                high of 1,045,700 barrels a day for the week ending August 9, 1957,
                                to a low of 880,000 barrels daily for the week ending August 30,
                                1957. West Coast imports have averaged 289,900 barrels daily for the
                                six-week period. Table I shows crude oil imports into the U.S. for
                                that period.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Tables II and III summarize the data supplied by the named
                                importing companies relating to their actual imports during July
                                1957 and projected imports, by months, for the remaining five months
                                of 1957. Again, it is interesting to note that the daily average for
                                the last half of 1957 is 839,800 barrels. This figure compared with
                                the Committee’s recommendations for the year ending June 30, 1958,
                                of a daily average of 755,700 barrels imports into Districts I
                                through IV shows an excess of 84,100 barrels daily. As stated
                                before, an overage is to be expected during the last half of 1957,
                                but the greater part of the expected overrun, even for this period,
                                can be attributed to two companies, named in the Committee
                                report—Tidewater Oil Company and Standard Oil Company (Indiana), and
                                to several importers such as Bay Refining Company whose past and
                                programmed imports were not included in the Report.</item>

                            <item>At this time, it is too early to predict with accuracy the success
                                of the Voluntary Program. Both Standard of Indiana and Tidewater,
                                whose petitions are being heard during the week of September 9,
                                1957, could have a most serious adverse effect on the program in the
                                event they failed to keep their imports closely in line with the
                                decision of the Administrator after their cases have been heard.
                                Such an event could not but result in other importers taking the
                                position that the program has failed and that they, in turn, are
                                justified in increasing their imports to maintain a relative
                                competitive position.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>Another potential source of danger to the program is the coming of
                                new importers into the field who neither desire to submit their case
                                for a hearing, or having so submitted, refuse to abide by the
                                decision of the Administrator as to approved import allowables. At
                                least three companies—Superior Oil, Ashland Oil and Refining Company
                                and Crown Central Petroleum Company—have indicated that they each
                                intend to begin crude oil imports of up to 20,000 to 25,000 barrels
                                daily. This quantity would certainly have an unfortunate effect on
                                other present importers who are now adhering to the plan. It is
                                quite possible, of course, that there will be others who want to
                                enter the import field in addition to those mentioned.</item>
                            <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0776"/>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>While the Committee recognized that new importers should have the
                                opportunity to begin importing crude oil, it appears that with a
                                normal annual increase in domestic demand of 3.4% to 3.8%, imports
                                could increase in a year 30,000 to 35,000 barrels daily and still
                                maintain a ratio of about 12% of imports to domestic production.
                                However, it is not clear at this time whether the increase in
                                allowable imports should all go to new importers (those not now
                                importing) or should be prorated between them and those who are now
                                importers. In any event, it appears most unlikely that an increase
                                in domestic demand will provide room for additional imports in the
                                quantities foreseen. The alternative, named by the Committee, for
                                the older importers to make room for the new importers (by further
                                curtailment of programmed imports) appears to have negligible
                                chances of success. It might also present a serious question of
                                possible antitrust violations as the older importers could, in
                                effect, determine what a newcomer would be allowed.</item>

                    <p>On September 19, the President’s Advisory Committee on Energy Supplies and
                        Resources Policy met to review the residual fuel oil imports situation. It
                        concluded that imports were substantially in line with what was needed to
                        satisfy demand not met by domestic supplies, but that importers should be
                        continually asked whether they planned any precipitous increase in
                        shipments. (Memorandum of conversation by Carl E. Bartch, Office of South

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HVR1">Hansen</persName> called to discuss the
                        anti-trust case the Department of Justice has pending against five major oil
                        producing companies: Standard Oil of New Jersey (<gloss target="#t_SONJ1"
                            >SONJ</gloss>), Socony-Vacuum, Standard Oil of California, Gulf and
                        Caltex. He referred briefly to the previous history of the matter. He said
                        State became interested when the question of new Middle East pipelines came
                        up, and had urged Justice to investigate the possibility of a consent decree
                        in view of the national security aspects of this case.</p>
                    <p>Since April 1957 Justice has been negotiating with <gloss target="#t_SONJ1"
                            >SONJ</gloss> which they considered the toughest nut to crack.
                        Eventually agreement was reached with <gloss target="#t_SONJ1">SONJ</gloss>
                        on a basis that was acceptable to the Attorney General and the President,
                        although it is still anticipated that it may cause trouble with the
                        Congress. With respect to the other companies there remains one unresolved
                        issue, i.e., the requirement by Justice that <gloss target="#t_SONJ1"
                            >SONJ</gloss> and Socony divide up their joint interest in the overseas
                        distribution facilities of Standard-Vacuum. This requires a separate
                        agreement between <gloss target="#t_SONJ1">SONJ</gloss> and Socony. Last
                        week Socony notified <gloss target="#t_SONJ1">SONJ</gloss> of its refusal to
                        accept the latter’s proposal for the split, in a letter which, according to
                            <persName corresp="#p_HVR1">Hansen</persName>, “slammed the door”. Mr.
                            <persName>Bicks</persName> commented that Socony’s grounds for refusal
                        were wholly commercial. He agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"
                            >Herter</persName>’s suggestion that this may be an attempt to drive a
                        hard business bargain.</p>
                    <p>The court has set a limit of December 17th for acceptance of the consent
                        decree by the parties. However, Justice must know by November 26th whether
                        to go ahead with the decree procedures, or to initiate the complex
                        preparations for a full trial. On November 21st <gloss target="#t_SONJ1"
                            >SONJ</gloss> approached <persName corresp="#p_HVR1">Hansen</persName>
                        informally seeking a delay of 3 days to permit them to intercede with Socony
                        in a final effort to reach agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HVR1"
                            >Hansen</persName> added he was convinced the other three <pb n="746"

                        the decree.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HVR1">Hansen</persName> said Justice does not want
                        to bring pressure on State, nor to suggest any specific action. He felt,
                        however, that he should report this critical situation because State was
                        responsible for initiating the consent decree action. The Under Secretary
                        explained that, because of a possible conflict of interest, he had
                        previously abstained from taking part in policy decisions involving
                        petroleum matters. However, he felt that in this instance he need not
                        hesitate because both State and Justice had already agreed on the need to
                        avoid a court fight, particularly in the light of the current situation in
                        the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HVR1">Hansen</persName> concluded by saying he felt
                        they were very close to a satisfactory settlement and that he hoped the
                        State Department might find some way to call the attention of Socony
                        officials to the importance we attach, from the standpoint of national
                        interest, to a settlement by consent decree. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"
                            >Herter</persName> agreed the Department would immediately explore what
                        might be done in this connection.</p>

                    <p>The Office of International Resources (<gloss target="#t_OR1">OR</gloss>) has
                        indicated that early this month the Cabinet Committee of Crude Oil Imports
                        may receive a proposal for limiting crude oil imports into the West Coast.
                        Persian Gulf crude represents almost one-third of the 350,000 barrels a day
                        of imports scheduled for the first half of 1958.</p>

                    <p>The Cabinet Committee on Crude Oil Imports in its report<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d279fn2">Attachment to <ref target="#d270">Document
                            270</ref>.</note> of last July established a voluntary system of quotas
                        for the purpose of limiting oil imports into Districts I through IV (the
                        Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and the Canadian border east of the Rockies). It
                        concluded that since no restrictions on domestic production were in effect
                        in California, and since the West Coast was a deficit area in oil, no
                        restrictions on imports into the West Coast were necessary. It did, however,
                        provide for periodic review of this matter.</p>
                    <p>Captain Carson, the Administrator of the voluntary quota system, has been
                        taking evidence at hearings regarding the situation with respect to oil
                        imports into the West Coast. The evidence presented to him by the petroleum
                        companies marketing in the area shows a program of oil imports scheduled at
                        about 350,000 barrels a day (almost one-third of which represents Persian
                        Gulf crude) for the first half of 1958. Imports into the area during 1957
                        were about 270,000 barrels a day. Production of oil in the area is forecast
                        at 925,000 barrels a day as against a figure of 930,000 barrels a day for
                        1957. (An oil company source has indicated that Persian Gulf crude has been
                        able to compete price-wise in this market due to its low cost of production
                        and the depressed tanker rate situation.) Although West Coast producers have
                        expressed apprehension over the rate of imports, no producer has indicated
                        that he has any shut-i oil or that he is now having any difficulty marketing
                        domestically produced petroleum.</p>
                    <p>However, it should be noted that, with the leveling off and decline of US
                        industrial activity this year, domestic West Coast producers may have some
                        grounds for concern over their ability to sell their oil in the short-run
                        future. For example, West Coast consumption has not increased as was
                        contemplated; the level for 1956 and 1957 being roughly the same. Moreover,
                        the Department of Interior’s consumption projections apparently show that
                        the West Coast would need only about 200,000 barrels per day during 1958 to
                        supplement domestic production.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances <gloss target="#t_OR1">OR</gloss> thinks it would
                        not be illogical to expect presentation to the Cabinet Committee of a
                        proposal for limiting imports to about 200,000 barrels a day as against the
                        projected 350,000 barrels. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName> has come to town from Los Angeles, and will be here
                        until December 12, to advise Captain Carson on the matter before the
                        Captain’s discussion with the Cabinet Committee. The countries which would
                        be adversely affected by a restriction on imports of oil to the West Coast
                        include those <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0780"/>in the Persian Gulf
                        and Indonesia, Venezuela and Canada. All of these countries have had reason
                        to believe that we would not limit imports into the West Coast.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_OR1">OR</gloss> has pointed out that, although the proposal
                        to limit oil imports into the West Coast is fundamentally unsound, it would
                        no doubt be expressed with considerable vigor in the name of national
                        security.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, however, it should be noted that shipments to the West Coast
                        represent only about four percent of total daily oil exports from the Middle
                        East. It is not expected, therefore, that limitation of oil imports into the
                        West Coast will result in significant economic consequences on the Persian
                        Gulf states. Moreover, it will be recalled that the reaction of these states
                        to the July limitation on oil imports into the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts was
                        almost nil.</p>

                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> who is in Washington in connection
                        with the study being given to the District V oil import situation.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d280fn2"><persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>,
                            who left the Department of State on February 5, was serving as
                            consultant to the Department of State on the Turkish pipeline.</note> I
                        told him that I had been reading about the developing problems on the West
                        Coast arising from increased imports and understood that consideration was
                        being given to finding some way to deal with the situation, perhaps under a
                        voluntary agreement similar to the one in effect for Districts I–IV. I told
                        him that I would like to speak to him about the problem because I feared
                        repercussions in the field of U.S.-Canadian relations.</p>
                    <p>Last Friday Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> called me to
                        his office to discuss the District V situation. He had some statistics which
                        showed a decline in U.S. imports of oil from Canada and an increase in
                        imports from other sources into District V. He explained that the imports
                        from Canada went entirely to two refineries in the State of Washington which
                        were, however, operating at only 68% of rated capacity. By way of
                        comparison, he pointed to figures showing the level of activity in four
                        refineries in British Columbia which were operating at some 50% of rated
                        capacity. (Today he said that he had learned that one reason for the very
                        low refinery activity in British Columbia was that one refinery had been on
                        strike.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said that the principal
                        reason why Canada was falling behind in supplying oil to District V
                        generally was the fact that the law in Alberta operated to penalize the
                        major companies which might otherwise have been interested in exporting the
                        oil. Not only was Alberta oil relatively high priced, its price being set in
                        relation to U.S. prices, but it was required that exports from Alberta be on
                        a pro rata basis. Thus if a major company wished to export a barrel of its
                        own oil it might have to purchase several additional barrels of some other
                        company’s oil, which thereupon became very expensive especially in relation
                        to oil produced in Sumatra or the <pb n="750" xml:id="pg_750" facs="0782"
                        />Middle East from which major companies could import their own
                        supplies.</p>
                    <p>As for the problem generally California required approximately 200,000
                        barrels a day of imports to supplement its domestic production plus oil
                        expected from the Four Corners area. Imports, however, were running over
                        300,000 barrels a day and promised to increase still further rather than to
                        decline. Stocks were being increased at the rate of 100,000 barrels per day
                        and there was every prospect for a disruptive price reduction if this
                        situation continued.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said that he doubted any
                        plan which might be worked out would penalize the Canadians. The companies
                        which imported from Canada had good historical positions in the import
                        picture and, moreover, had some public relations incentives for trying to
                        bring their oil from Alberta to Washington. I called his attention to the
                        assurances given by the Secretary to Prime Minister Diefenbaker at the time
                        of their first meeting in July when the Secretary noted the care we were
                        taking not to harm Canadian oil interest. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName> replied that the conversation referred to the plans
                        then being considered for Districts I–IV and observed that imports from
                        Canada into this area had indeed been very fairly treated. He also noted
                        that the Secretary had said that other measures would be required if the
                        voluntary agreement did not prove successful. The voluntary agreement,
                        according to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>, has been
                        eminently successful east of the Rockies and most of the heat has gone out
                        of the criticism previously engendered by the import situation. He stated
                        that it was essential, in his judgment, to find a similar solution to the
                        District V problem before the Congress reconvened in order to avoid
                        restrictive action by that body. He noted that serious controversy regarding
                        oil imports could be a substantial hazard to the renewal of the trade
                        agreements program.</p>
                    <p>He said that he had given some consideration to the possibility of
                        arrangements favoring Canada but had concluded that any of the possible
                        preferences would be too patently discriminatory to make them practical.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said that he was willing
                        to talk to Canadian Embassy people about the West Coast problem and,
                        accordingly, arrangements have been made for Messrs. <persName

                        in answering press queries tomorrow: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The President announced on December 23, 1957, that he had approved
                                the recommendations of the Special Committee to investigate crude
                                oil imports as set forth in their Second Report and had requested
                                the Secretary and the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization
                                to put such recommendations into effect as soon as possible.</p>
                            <p>“The recommendations of the Special Committee call for the extension
                                into District V, the West Coast Area, of a voluntary program of
                                restrictions on crude oil imports similar to that which has been
                                applied to other parts of the United States since June 26, 1957. In
                                recommending this measure, the Special Committee recognized that
                                there are important foreign policy aspects to the problem of
                                limiting petroleum imports, and that the oil reserves and production
                                capacities of other free nations, as well as our own, are important
                                to our national security. A number of countries inevitably depend in
                                varying degree upon access to the American domestic market for their
                                petroleum exports and it is in the interest of the national security
                                of the United States that its allies and friends have healthy and
                                expanding economies. They considered, however, that taking all
                                factors into consideration, the national security required the
                                maintenance of some reasonable balance between imports and domestic
                                production in the District V Area at this time. Consequently, the
                                recommendations were framed with the objective of limiting imports
                                in order to maintain such a balance and yet to allow other <pb

                    <p>The Venezuelan Government exercised restraint in its initial comments about
                        proposed restrictions on crude oil imports in July and early August 1957,
                        but reacted strongly when President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> announced on December 23 that these restrictions
                        would be extended to District V on the West Coast. In explaining on July 26
                        the forthcoming recommendations of the President’s Special Committee to
                        Ambassador González of Venezuela, <persName corresp="#p_BMM1">Maurice
                            Bernbaum</persName>, Director of the Office of Middle American Affairs,
                        said he personally felt that the new formula was the best the Committee
                        could work out at the present time. The Ambassador agreed with Bernbaum’s
                        assertion that Venezuela would receive special treatment since no
                        restrictions were being imposed on residual fuel oils which constituted a
                        substantial part of Venezuela’s production. (Memorandum of conversation,
                        July 26; Department of State, Central Files, 411.006/7–2657) In a
                        conversation with Minister-Counselor Burrows in Caracas on August 7, Foreign
                        Minister José Loreto Arismendi described the limitation as “imposed
                        voluntary action” and reflected concern that it violated the spirit of the
                        reciprocal trade agreement. (Telegram 101 from Caracas, August 7; <hi

                    <p>In October, Venezuelan officials expressed their irritation at the favored
                        position given Canada in District V (telegram 303 from Caracas, October 23;
                            <hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 411.006/10–2357) and asked why the
                        restrictions were applied only to the Eastern States which imported
                        Venezuelan petroleum. (Telegram 311 from Caracas, October 29; <hi
                            rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 411.006/10–2957)</p>
                    <p>On December 28, Arismendi told Burrows in Caracas that the District V
                        restrictions injured Venezuela and were protectionist measures favoring one
                        certain sector of North American industry. He said, “We consider them
                        harmful to good commercial relations between two countries and, should they
                        become established policy, we would be obliged, logically, to revise our
